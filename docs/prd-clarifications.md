# PRD Clarification Q&A

This document records the clarifying questions asked by the AI assistant and the answers provided by the user during the initial phase of generating the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the Human DER Worker Digital Twin project.

### Question 1: Problem/Goal

**AI:** The proposal is academic. What is the single most important real-world problem this HDT framework is intended to solve? Is it primarily about knowledge preservation for a retiring workforce, improving operational efficiency, or enhancing safety?

**User:** enable digital twin modeling capabilities for a variety of energy operational simulations

---

### Question 2: Target User

**AI:** The document mentions "technical operators and maintenance personnel" as the focus. Could you describe a specific role? For example, are we talking about a solar farm technician, a microgrid controller, or someone else?

**User:** this project should research the breadth of available roles in order to evaluate and focus on a few

---

### Question 3: Core Functionality

**AI:** If you were to imagine a "minimum viable product" for this framework, what is the absolute core piece of a human worker's behavior you would want the Digital Twin to model first? (e.g., how they diagnose a specific fault, how they decide to schedule maintenance, how they communicate with another operator).

**User:** this project should research the depth of consequential behaviors in order to evaluate and focus on a set

---

### Question 4: Success Metrics

**AI:** How would we know if the HDT is "effectively modeling" a human's behavior? Is the goal for the twin to produce the *exact same* operational outputs, or is it more about capturing the decision-making *process*?

**User:** the calibration of the llm model increase representativeness of the model towards operational outputs, thus enabling the predictive function of digital twin modeling

---

### Question 5: Scope/Boundaries

**AI:** The proposal mentions the research will *not* build a fully operational software system. For the purpose of the PRD, what level of "implementation" should be documented? Should the PRD describe a conceptual architecture, a software prototype, or something else?

**User:** a fully operational software system in this case implies the requirement of end-to-end adaptability for third party digital twin applications, which requires a level of software packaging expertise, and my intent was to avoid the costs therein needed to acquire such expertise. the software is considered complete for the PRD if it can be operated on the selected few cases
