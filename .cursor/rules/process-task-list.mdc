# Task List Management

Guidelines for managing task lists to track PRD completion.

## AI Instructions

1. **After Task Execution:**
    - If all subtasks under a parent are done, mark the parent as done.
    - Execute one sub-task at a time. Await user "yes" or "y" before marking complete and moving to the next.
    - Do not create new tasks without user permission.

2. **Before Task Execution:**
    - Review file names in `util/`, `data/`, and `docs/`.
    - Read task-relevant files (current and prior).
    - Employ best practices for the task type.

3. **During Task Execution:**
    - Use standard directory locations:
        - `archive/`: Reference code, deleted items.
        - `external/`: User inputs, API outputs.
        - `data/`: Processed data.
        - `util/`: Scripts and utilities.
        - `docs/`: Summaries and documentation.
    - Create data sources and processing scripts in `data/` and `util/` respectively.
    - Scripts in `util/` should take file paths as arguments to minimize hardcoded data.
