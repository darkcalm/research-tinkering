# Rule: Generating a Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goal
To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) in Markdown format, based on an initial user prompt. The PRD should be clear, actionable, and suitable for a junior developer to understand and implement the feature.

## Process
1.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides a brief description or request for a new feature or functionality. If no description is provided, check `external/`.
2.  **Process External Files:**
    *   The `external/proposal` directory contains the research proposal and related literature. This should be treated as the primary source for requirements.
    *   The `external/digital_twin` directory contains a previous, simplified implementation of a digital twin. There is no obligation to follow its design or code; it serves only as a historical reference. The research proposal in `external/al` supersedes it.
3.  **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Before writing the PRD, the AI *must* ask clarifying questions to gather sufficient detail. The goal is to understand the "what" and "why" of the feature, not necessarily the "how" (which the developer will figure out).
4.  **Generate PRD:** Based on the initial prompt and the user's answers to the clarifying questions, generate a PRD using the structure outlined below.
5.  **Save PRD:** Save the generated document as `prd-[feature-name].md` inside the `tasks/` directory.

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)
*   **Problem/Goal:** "What problem does this feature solve for the user?"
*   **Target User:** "Who is the primary user of this feature?"
*   **Core Functionality:** "Can you describe the key actions a user should be able to perform?"
*   **User Stories:** "Could you provide a few user stories?"
*   **Acceptance Criteria:** "How will we know when this feature is successfully implemented?"
*   **Scope/Boundaries:** "Are there any specific things this feature *should not* do?"

## PRD Structure
1.  **Introduction/Overview**
2.  **Goals**
3.  **User Stories**
4.  **Functional Requirements**
5.  **Non-Goals (Out of Scope)**
6.  **Design Considerations (Optional)**
7.  **Technical Considerations (Optional)**
8.  **Success Metrics**
9.  **Open Questions**

## Target Audience
Assume the primary reader of the PRD is a **junior developer**.

## Output
*   **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
*   **Location:** `tasks/`
*   **Filename:** `prd-[feature-name].md`

## Final instructions
1. Do NOT start implementing the PRD
2. Make sure to ask the user clarifying questions
3. Take the user's answers to the clarifying questions and improve the PRD
