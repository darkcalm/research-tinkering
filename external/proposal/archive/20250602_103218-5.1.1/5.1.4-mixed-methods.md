*Generated: 2025-06-02T09:12:28.496848*

## Research Context

**Focus**: Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) and Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A)
**Domain**: Distributed Energy Resources (DER) predictive maintenance
**Overarching Methodology**: Design Science Research
**Method Category Role**: Integration of quantitative and qualitative approaches for triangulation

## Category Overview

Systematic evaluation of mixed-method approaches for comprehensive protocol research

## Documented Methods

**Total Methods**: 2
**Recommended Methods**: 1
**Methods to Avoid**: 0

### Recommended Methods

#### Design Science Research
- **Type**: Integrative Research Framework
- **Purpose**: Design and evaluate protocol adaptation artifacts through iterative design-evaluation cycles
- **Feasibility**: 4/5
- **Relevance**: 5/5

## Integration Considerations

**Primary Methodology**: Design Science Research

### Method Combinations
- **Recommended Core**: comparative_analysis, metrics_framework, experimental_simulation
- **Supporting Methods**: document_analysis, case_study_analysis

### Integration Patterns
- **Sequential Integration**: Methods executed in sequence with outputs feeding into next method
- **Parallel Integration**: Methods executed simultaneously with convergent validation
- **Embedded Integration**: One method embedded within another for enhanced validation

## Sources Used
