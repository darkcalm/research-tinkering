# Archive: Incorrectly Executed 5.x Tasks

**Date Archived**: 2025-06-02
**Reason**: Conceptual error in task execution

## Problem

The 5.x tasks were incorrectly executed with a fundamental misunderstanding of the distinction between **methodology** and **method**:

- **Methodology**: The overall research approach and philosophical framework (e.g., Design Science Research, Grounded Theory, Case Study Methodology)
- **Method**: Specific tools and procedures within a methodology (e.g., interviews, surveys, document analysis)

## What Was Done Wrong

The executed tasks compared and evaluated individual **methods** (like "Experimental Simulation", "Document Analysis") as if they were competing **methodologies**, when they should have been comparing overarching research **methodologies** like:

- Design Science Research
- Case Study Methodology  
- Grounded Theory
- Action Research
- Sequential Explanatory Mixed Methods
- etc.

## Files Archived

### Documentation Files
All 5.1.x and 5.2.x files that incorrectly focused on methods instead of methodologies:

- 5.1.1-relevant-methods.md/json
- 5.1.2-quantitative-methods.md/json  
- 5.1.3-qualitative-methods.md/json
- 5.1.4-mixed-methods.md/json
- 5.1.5-emerging-methods.md/json
- 5.2.1-method-comparison-matrix.md/json/csv
- 5.2.2-method-strengths-limitations.md/json
- 5.2.3-method-resource-requirements.md/json
- 5.2.4-method-feasibility-analysis.md/json

### Tools/Scripts Files
Associated Python scripts used to generate the incorrect analysis:

- 5.1.1_identify_relevant_methods.py
- 5.1.2_document_quantitative_approaches.py
- 5.1.x_document_research_methods.py
- 5.2.1_create_comparison_matrix.py
- 5.2.2_evaluate_strengths_limitations.py
- 5.2.3_assess_resource_requirements.py
- 5.2.4_analyze_feasibility.py

## Next Steps

Restart 5.x tasks with correct focus on **methodologies**, not methods.
