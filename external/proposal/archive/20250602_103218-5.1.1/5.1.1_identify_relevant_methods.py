Tool: Identify Relevant Research Methods (Task 5.1.1)

Purpose: Systematically identify and categorize relevant research methodologies
for investigating agent communication protocols (ACP/A2A) in DER predictive maintenance

Research Context:
- Focus: Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) and Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A)
- Domain: Distributed Energy Resources (DER) predictive maintenance coordination
- Scope: Protocol application, adaptation, and evaluation framework development
- Timeframe: 20-week Master's thesis

This script identifies methodologies across quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-method approaches
suitable for protocol research in distributed energy systems.
