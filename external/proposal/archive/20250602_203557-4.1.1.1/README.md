# Archived Project Materials (Reorganization of 2025-06-02)

This directory contains files and scripts that were archived on 2025-06-02 due to a refinement of the research project's direction.

The project's focus was narrowed to the "primary subfocus" defined in the document `docs/3.1.2-research-direction-selection.md` (located in the main project's `docs` directory). This subfocus is:

> "Designing a conceptual framework and specifying core messaging patterns (using ACP and/or A2A primitives) for **decentralized DER health data exchange and predictive maintenance task initiation** between DER agents and maintenance provider agents."

As a result of this refined focus, materials primarily related to broader explorations, semantic searches, and methodology evaluations performed after Task 4.1.1.1 (Elicit.com search strategy) were deemed less directly relevant to the new, more targeted research path and have been moved here.

This archive includes:
- `sources/4.1-semantic-search/`: The entire directory related to broader semantic search efforts.
- `tools/`: Scripts related to tasks numerically after 4.1.1.1 (e.g., semantic search processing, extensive literature analysis tools beyond the initial Elicit.com phase, full methodology comparison, etc.).
- `docs/`: Documents and subdirectories numerically after 4.1.1.1, reflecting the outputs of the archived tools and broader analyses.

These materials are preserved for reference but are not part of the active development path following the strategic reframing of the project.
