| Operational Requirements | {len(needs['Operational Requirements'])} | High |
| Integration and Interoperability Needs | {len(needs['Integration and Interoperability Needs'])} | Critical |
| Validation and Testing Needs | {len(needs['Validation and Testing Needs'])} | High |
| Implementation and Deployment Needs | {len(needs['Implementation and Deployment Needs'])} | Medium |
| Sustainability and Policy Needs | {len(needs['Sustainability and Policy Needs'])} | Medium |
| Research and Development Needs | {len(needs['Research and Development Needs'])} | Long-term |
