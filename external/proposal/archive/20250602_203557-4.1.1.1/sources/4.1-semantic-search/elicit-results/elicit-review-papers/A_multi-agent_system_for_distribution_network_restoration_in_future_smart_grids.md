I. INTRODUCTION
The term grid is traditionally used for an electricity de-
livery system that may support all or some of the following
four operations: electricity generation, electricity transmission,
electricity distribution, and electricity control [1].
By using two-way ﬂows of electricity and information,
smart grid, an enhancement of the traditional power grid,
attempts to create an automated, distributed, and advanced
energy delivery network. This enhanced grid is expected to
provide distributed power generation, self-monitoring, self-
healing, adaptive and islanding microgrid, pervasive control,
and various customer choices.
In order to realize these functions, an advanced information
and communication system underlying the smart grid will play
a critical role. For example, in the peak period, the electric
utility notiﬁes the users the real-time price so as to convince
them to reduce their power demands. Therefore, the total de-
mand proﬁle full of peaks can be shaped to a nicely smoothed
demand proﬁle. This can help electric utility reduce overall
plant and capital cost requirements. In order to realize this,
an information communication network, which can guarantee
the realtime price notiﬁcation, is required. Another example
is that to realize grid self-healing requires a widely deployed
monitoring system. The grid status information obtained by
this monitoring system should be sent to the controller in a
timely manner. Suppose that a medium voltage transformer
failure event occurs in the smart grid. This failure can be
detected by the monitoring system and then reported to the
controller promptly. Therefore, the smart grid automatically
changes the power ﬂow and recovers the power delivery
service.
In this article, we focus on the wireless communication and
networking technologies, which may be used in the future
smart grid. Although Xi et al. [1] did a comprehensive survey
on the smart grid, in this work we will reﬁne the exploration
of smart grid and present our vision for smart grid from
the perspective of wireless communication and networking
technologies. We present four wireless communication and
networking paradigms for typical scenarios in the future
smart grid and also point out the research challenges of the
communication and networking technologies used in the smart
grid.
The rest of this article is organized as follows. In Section
II, we overview the basic concept of the smart grid. Then, we
vision the wireless communication and networking paradigms
for four important scenarios in Section III and describe some
research challenges in Section IV. Finally, we conclude this
article in Section V.
II. OVERVIEW OF SMART GRID
A traditional power grid is unidirectional in nature. Fig.1
shows an example of the traditional power grid. Electricity is
usually generated at central power plants by electromechanical
generators, primarily driven by the force of ﬂowing water
or heat engines fueled by chemical combustion or nuclear
ﬁssion. These power generating plants are often quite large and
located away from heavily populated areas. The electric power
generated by these plants is stepped up to a higher voltage for
transmission on a transmission grid. The transmission grid
moves the power over long distances to substations. Upon
arrival at the substation, the power is stepped down to a
distribution level voltage. As the power exits the substation, it
enters the distribution grid. Finally, upon arrival at the service
location, the power is stepped down again from the distribution
voltage to the required service voltage(s).

An Example of the Smart Grid
In contrast, the smart grid uses two-way ﬂows of electricity
and information to create an automated and distributed ad-
vanced energy delivery network. In a smart grid, the energy
generation and delivery is more ﬂexible. Fig.2 shows an
example of a smart grid. The distribution grid may also be
capable of generating electricity by using distributed energy
generations, such as wind turbines and solar panels. Note that
the transmission grid could also have large-scale distributed
generators (e.g. wind farm) connected. Since now power
can be generated by users, we can group these distributed
energy generators and loads as a microgrid [1]. The mi-
crogrid normally operates connected to a traditional power
grid (a macrogrid). The single point of common coupling
with the macrogrid can be disconnected. The microgrid can
then function autonomously without obtaining power from the
electric utility in the macrogrid. Thus, the multiple distributed
generators and the ability to isolate the microgrid from a larger
network in disturbance will provide highly reliable electric
power supply. The smart grid also takes advantage of the plug-
in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). PHEVs can communicate
with the grid and deliver electricity into the grid at peak
electricity usage times, if they are parked and connected to
the grid. These vehicles can then be recharged during off-peak
hours at cheaper rates.
Due to the complicated power delivery pattern is being
used, the information delivery system should also be updated.
Broadly stated, by utilizing modern information technologies,
the smart grid could respond to events that occur anywhere in
the grid, such as power generation, transmission, distribution,
and consumption, and then adopt the corresponding strategies
or behaviors.
III. WIRELESS COMMUNICATION AND NETWORKING
PARADIGMS IN SMART GRID
In Section II, we brieﬂy overview the smart grid. In this
section, we present four scenarios and the communication
and networking technologies that may be applicable in these
scenarios.
A. Smart Home
Automatic metering infrastructure (AMI) or smart meters

An Example of Smart Home
been widely regarded as the most important mechanism in the
smart grid for obtaining information from end users’ devices
and appliances, while also controlling the behaviors of the
devices [1].
A smart meter is usually an electrical meter that records
consumption in intervals of an hour or less and sends that
information at least daily back to the utility for monitoring
and billing purposes. Since based on this infrastructure all the
information is available in read time and on demand, both
electric utility and users are able to adjust the supply and
demand proﬁle to improve the system operations and their
own beneﬁts.
In the future smart homes, many applications become pos-
sible based on this infrastructure.
First, end users are able to estimate bills and thus manage
their energy consumptions to reduce bills. For example, as
shown in Fig.3, the smart meter can collect information and
power consumption from the dishwasher, the refrigerator, and
the air conditioner. Based on the realtime price information
from electric utility, the smart meter can disconnect-reconnect
remotely and control these user appliances to reduce electricity
cost. In order to realize the wireless communications between
the smart meter and the user appliances, ZigBee Smart Energy
Proﬁle (SEP) has been selected by a large number of utilities as
the communications platform [1]. This wireless communica-
tion standard provides a standardized platform for exchanging
data between smart metering devices and appliances located
on customer premises. The features supported by the SEP
include demand response, advanced metering support, realtime
pricing, text messaging, and load control [9].
Second, the smart meter should also provide a communica-
tion and control mechanism between smart home and remote
house owner. Let us consider a simple example pointed out
by Xi et al. [1]. In summer, the house owners hope that
when they get home, the temperature at home is around
60 −80◦F. Thus, the smart meter connected to the air
conditioner can periodically inquire the position of the house
owner by attempting to send the inquiry information to the


---

owner’s smart phone which can obtain the owner’s position
via GPS. If the smart meter ﬁnds the owner is coming back
home, it will decide to turn on the air conditioner in advance
so that when the owner gets home, the temperature at home
is around 60 −80◦F. In this application, the smart meter is
able to not only remotely control the air conditioner via, for
example, a Zigbee platform, but also exchange information
between house owner and itself. For the latter information,
the smarter meter may need to contact to the service provider
of the owner’s cell phone via a cellular system as shown in
Fig.3.
Third, in the future smart home, smart meter should not
only be used for an interface between the future smart home
and electric utility. Like “Apple’s Application Store”[3], many
management applications and services are available online.
Users can choose their expected services and download to
the local system (e.g. the smart meter) [1]. For example,
a user who needs a management program supporting the
example about smart control of air conditioner mentioned
above, can buy this program from the Smart Grid Store
online and download it. This Smart Grid Store provides an
integrated platform, which can drive the third party to develop
new management programs and meantime help users easily
customize their management services.
In addition to Zigbee and cellular systems, WIFI could also
be used in a smart home. The most important advantage of
WIFI is that it has been widely used and has mature standards.
The smart meter can transmit its information to a WIFI access
point, and the information then would be routed to the electric
utility.
B. Microgrid
Access Point
Microgrid
Fig. 4.
An Example of Microgrid
Microgrid is seen as one of the cornerstones of the future
smart grids [4], [2]. The organic evolution of the smart grid
is expected to come through the plug-and-play integration
of microgrids. An important operation of microgrid is that
distributed energy generations and loads are grouped together,
and thus the microgrid can disconnect from the macrogrid and
function autonomously. This intentional islanding of genera-
tions and loads has the potential to provide a higher local
reliability than that provided by the power system as a whole.
The information exchange among the users is needed
for operating a microgrid. For example, ﬁrst, they need to
decide when they will operate in an islanding mode, and
how to optimize the power usage and resource allocation if
the microgrid is working in islanding mode. Second, when
the distributed generators (e.g. solar panels) of some users
generate more power than these users need, they may sell the
electricity to other users in this microgrid. This transaction
needs information exchange among these users.
A wireless mesh network is an applicable network archi-
tecture to realize the information exchange among the users
in a microgrid. Note that a wireless mesh network is a
communication network made up of radio nodes organized
in a mesh topology. First, a wireless mesh network is a self-
organized and self-conﬁgured. Considering that the smart grid
allows a large number of plug-and-play devices, this feature
is very important. Second, since usually multiple paths exist
between any two nodes in a mesh network, this provides a
high communication reliability. Third, mature research and
industry standards have been carried out for a wireless mesh
network. Wireless mesh networks can be implemented with
various wireless technology including IEEE 802.11, 802.15,
802.16, cellular technologies or combinations of more than
one type.
C. Electric Vehicle System
Fig. 5.
An Example of Electric Vehicle System: Vehicles can exchange
information among them via a self-organized mobile adhoc network or a base
station.
An electric vehicle is a vehicle that uses one or more electric
motors for propulsion. As fossil fuels diminish and generally
get more expensive, electric vehicles or plug-in hybrid vehicles
will rise in popularity. The wide use and deployment of electric
vehicles will have a signiﬁcant impact on future grid.
The ﬁrst impact is that charging electric vehicles will lead to
a signiﬁcant new load on the existing distribution grids. Recent
study has shown that high penetration levels of uncoordinated
plug-in hybrid electric vehicles charging will signiﬁcantly
reduce power system performance and efﬁciency, and even
lead to overloading [8]. The second impact is that electric
vehicles provide a new way to store and supply electric power.
This concept is called as Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) in the vision
of the smart grid [1]. It allows V2G vehicles to provide power
to help balance loads by “peak shaving” (sending power back
to the grid when demand is high) and “valley ﬁlling” (charging
when demand is low).
In order to integrate electric vehicle systems into power grid,
wireless information technologies will play an important role.

First, in order to mitigate the negative impact of electric
vehicle charging, the charging behaviors of electric vehicles
should be regulated. For example, it is recommended to do
coordinated charging. More speciﬁcally, a group of electric
vehicles can optimize their charging operations and schedules
based on their demands, to guarantee that they will not
charge at the same time or when the power demand in
the grid is already high. Realizing the coordinated charging
requires vehicles, electric utility, and even charging station
to exchange a large amount of information, such as location
information, battery information, charging service availability
information, and grid power supply information. Based on this
information, optimizing charging operations and schedules is
implementable. Cellular communication systems and mobile
adhoc networks (MANETs) are two wireless communication
architectures which are applicable in this scenario. Cellular
communication system has already been used for vehicle
road assistance. For example, “Google Map” on smart phones
provides real-time trafﬁc, which helps the users to ﬁnd the
fastest route. Using existing cellular systems and smart phone
platform to realize this charging assistant programming has the
following beneﬁt. Developing a charging assistant program on
smart phone and using the mature cellular system behind it
as the information exchange medium, instead of developing
a new wireless system, is a cost-effective solution. Every
user can beneﬁt from this technology as long as they install
this program on their smart phones. In addition, MANET
is also a promising platform in this scenario. MANET is a
self-conﬁguring infrastructureless network of mobile devices
connected by wireless links. Such networks can further be con-
nected to the larger Internet. Based on MANET, vehicles can
exchange the information efﬁciently and thus make effective
decisions.
Second, real-time information exchange is also needed for
realizing the concept V2G. Suppose an electric vehicle with
excess power in a parking lot, which has been connected to
the grid. When the electric utility in the smart grid needs
electric vehicles to send the power back to the grid in the
peak time, they must contact with the owner of this vehicle to
get a permission to use the battery of this vehicle. The most
effective way to realize this information exchange is using the
existing cellular communication system. After the utility gets
the permission, it needs to remotely control the vehicle. This
can be done via the wireless network, where the vehicle is
located in.
D. Monitoring System
Self-monitoring and self-healing are important features in
the vision of the smart grid. A large number of sensors are
expected to be deployed in order to detect failure events
in power grids, such as conductor failures, tower collapses,
hot spots, and extreme mechanical conditions. Fig. 6 shows
an example of such monitoring system, which uses wireless
sensor networks to provide remote system monitoring and
diagnosis. A base station reports the grid status to the grid
operator periodically via a backbone communication network.
This backbone communication network is often built on a
Fig. 6.
An Example of Monitoring System
ﬁber optic network. The sensors collect the status and transmit
this information to the base station via one-hop or multi-
hop wireless networks. Note that a wireless sensor network is
probably the most cost-effective way to realize this monitoring
system for the following reasons. First, wireless sensors have
fairly low installment and deployment costs. Second, if the
density of the sensors is high enough, the sensor networks
would provide fairly high reliability and survivability. This is
because each area may be covered by multiple sensors. Even if
some sensors fail, it is highly likely that the important areas are
still being monitored. This effectively reduces the maintenance
cost.
IV. CHALLENGES FOR THE RESEARCH ON WIRELESS
TECHNOLOGIES IN SMART GRID
In Section III, we presented the wireless communication
and networking paradigms for four important scenarios in
the smart grid. In this section, we describe some issues and
challenges existing in the research on the wireless technologies
for the smart grid.
A. QoS and Entropy of Information Data
The diversity of the information transmitted within the smart
grid makes it necessary to differentiate the quality of service
(QoS) of the data. Roughly speaking, we can categorize
the data into two types: critical data (e.g. the critical grid
status information collected by the monitoring system) and
non-critical data (e.g. user energy consumption and billing
information exchanged between the smart meter and electric
utility). We must pay a particular attention on the QoS of
the critical grid status information. In other words, we should
guarantee that this type of data is sent to the controller in
a timely manner. Otherwise, losing real-time grid monitoring
may result in outage or disastrous results, such as cascading
blackouts. Therefore, ensuring that the critical monitoring
data is delivered on time is a prerequisite to improve the
grid reliability and realize self-healing once failure events
take place. However, as the wireless environment is usually
unreliable, realizing this objective is not easy task.
For the wireless communications in the smart grid, we also
need to consider the entropy of the transmitted data. Since


---

a large number of sensors and smart meters are used in the
smart grid, a large amount of data (e.g. sensing data) will be
generated. However, this data may have a large amount of
redundancy. For example, the smart meter readings must be
similar when no activity takes place at home. The monitoring
data generated by the sensors in the vicinity may also have
information redundancy. It is well-known that the wireless
spectrum is a scarce resource. Transmitting a large amount
of redundant data signiﬁcantly reduces the resource usage.
Therefore, improving the entropy of the transmitted data in
the smart grid would be beneﬁcial.
B. Wireless Communication Network Management and Con-
trol
A basic question about the wireless communication network
used in the smart grid is: Should this network be organized
in a distributed manner or a centralized manner? There is
no straightforward answer to this question. On one hand, the
traditional electric utility will still play a dominant role in
the foreseeable future. A large amount of information should
still be controlled and managed by one or multiple large
centralized electric utilities. Note that although distributed
wireless communication networks (such as ad hoc networks)
have been studied for a long time, it is interesting that
the centralized control structure is still much more popular,
especially for the commercial systems where central utilities
are involved. On the other hand, many distributed entities
are introduced into the smart grid, which makes distributed
communication network be a competitive choice. For example,
a microgrid can be organized in a distributed manner. It
may prefer a distributed and self-organized communication
network structure, because a large number of plug-and-play
devices may be used and a microgrid is expected to have
the capacity of functioning autonomously. In brief, how to
effectively organize the wireless network in the smart grid is
still an open question and is worth further investigation.
Another question is how to optimize the complicated
heterogenous wireless communication system underlying the
smart grid, where multiple wireless communication technolo-
gies are used simultaneously. Note that due to the industry
standards and utility interests these technologies may overlap
in both time and space. For example, a smart meter may
exchange data with the user appliances via Zigbee (due to
the user appliance industry standard), transmit information to
the electric utility via WiMax (because it is cost-effective for
the electric utility to set up or lease one base station to cover
a large number of users), and keep in touch with the house
owner’s phone via a cellular communication system (suppose
that the house owner always carries a 3G smart phone). The
question is how to jointly optimize these different wireless
networks to reduce cost and improve the wireless resource
utilization.
C. Security and Privacy
Cyber security is regarded as one of the biggest challenges
in the smart grid [5]. The malicious attacks on the wireless
communication networks underlying the smart grid can be
categorized into three major types based on their goals [7], [1]:
network availability, information privacy, and data integrity.
Network Availability: Malicious attacks targeting network
availability attempt to delay or block information transmission
in order to make system resources unavailable to nodes that
need to exchange information in the smart grid. As a result,
the real-time monitoring of critical power infrastructures may
be lost, which may further lead to a possible global power
system disasters. For example, in power grids cascading failure
is common when one of the elements fails and shifts its load
to nearby elements in the system. Those nearby elements
are then pushed beyond their capacity. As a result, they
become overloaded and shift their load onto other elements.
This failure process cascades through the elements of the
system and continues until substantially all of the elements
in the system are compromised. In concept, smart grid is
expected to handle this case by widely deploying monitoring
devices to monitor the grid realtime status. When wireless
communication network availability is compromised, the mon-
itoring information cannot be transmitted effectively to the
controller. As a result, one element failure may lead to a
disastrous cascading failure. Therefore, as pointed out by
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [5], the
design of information transmission networks that are robust to
attacks targeting network availability is the top priority.
Information privacy: The major beneﬁt provided by the
smart grid, i.e. the ability to get richer data to and from
customer meters and other electric devices, is also its Achilles’
heel from a privacy viewpoint [5]. The energy use information
stored at the meter acts as an information-rich side channel.
This opens up a door for a malicious attacker, who is interested
in the personal information such as individual’s habits, behav-
iors, activities, preferences, and even beliefs. Once the wireless
transmission security is broken by the attacker, the attacker
can retrieve this privacy information by analyzing energy use
information.
Data integrity: Data integrity attack attempts to deliberately
modify or corrupt information transmitted within the smart
grid. This may lead to an extremely damaging result in the
smart grid. For example, Liu et al. [6] showed that an attacker
can manipulate the state estimate without triggering bad-data
alarms in the control center. This attack is called the false-data
injection attack or the stealth attack. Consider the cascading
failure example above. An attacker can compromise one grid
element and prevent the control center from detecting this by
using stealth attack. This may result in a disastrous cascading
failure.
In summary, the advanced communication infrastructure
introduced in the smart grid is a double-edged sword. On
one hand, it provides a way for the power grid to realize
complicated operations and functions. On the other hand,
expanded communication paths can easily result in an increase
in vulnerability to cyber attacks and system failures. Security
is a never-ending game of wits, pitting attackers versus asset
owners. How to guarantee cyber security for the smart grid
will be a long-term research topic.

D. Interoperability and Compatibility
Thus far, the smart grid is not a thing but rather a vision. It
is regarded as a loose integration of complementary compo-
nents, functions, subsystems, and services under the pervasive
control of highly intelligent management-and-control systems.
Therefore, many different wireless communication protocols
and technologies probably will be used in the smart grid. As
a result, realizing interoperability among them is not an easy
task. Although NIST [5] has proposed a draft of framework
and roadmap for smart grid interoperability standards, many
problems are still left to address.
First, we need to consider how to take advantage of
the legacy infrastructure, in order to reduce the deployment
and installment cost of the wireless communication system
underlying the new smart grid. The cellular communication
system and the WIFI network are two widely used wireless
infrastructure. It would be beneﬁcial to investigate how to
effectively integrate these two systems into the smart grid
vision.
Second, we should consider not only how to take advantage
of the existing wireless communication systems, but also the
system forward compatibility. Since the current concept of
the smart grid is just a vision, many new features will be
integrated into the new grid in the future. We must consider
that the current design for the wireless communication systems
underlying the smart grid can also be used or can be easily
upgraded to support new features.
Third, from a technical point of view, the classic layer model
(e.g. the famous Open Systems Interconnection model) could
provide a promising conceptual solution to realize interoper-
ability among different wireless communication technologies.
However, it is well-known that this layer model suffers in
some modern applications. For instance, the performance of
the pure TCP may be very bad in wireless networks, because
it cannot differentiate packet loss due to wireless fading from
that due to a real congestion in the network. Therefore, in
practice some functions or services are not tied to a given
layer, but can affect more than one layer, in order to improve
the quality of services. This concept often requires cross-layer
design and optimization. However, interoperability among
different communication technologies, a precursor to cross-
layer approaches, is difﬁcult [1].
V. CONCLUSIONS
There is no doubt that the smart grid will lead to better
power supply services and a more environmentally sound
future. However, we still have a long way to go before this
vision comes true. Communication system is a nervous system
of this new grid and requires a large amount of research effort.
In the article, we have visioned the wireless communication
and networking paradigms for four typical scenarios in the
smart grid and point out the research challenges for wireless
communication and networking technologies in the smart grid.
We believe that more and more communication paradigms
would emerge as the research on the smart grid is extended.
Eventually, the information transmission network and energy
delivery system will be organically integrated, which will
revolutionize our daily life.
