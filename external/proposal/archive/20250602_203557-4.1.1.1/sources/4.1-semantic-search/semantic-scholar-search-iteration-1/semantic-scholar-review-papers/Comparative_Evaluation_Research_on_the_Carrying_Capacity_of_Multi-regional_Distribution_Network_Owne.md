Abstract: This paper proposes a comparative evaluation method for the carrying capacity of the owner's 
project department based on combined weights. This method first combines the current grid companies’ 
requirements for the construction of the owner’s project department and the current distribution network 
construction management issues to systematically construct the owner’s project department’s carrying 
capacity evaluation index system. Through comprehensive evaluation and collection of indicator-related data, 
it is determined based on the coefficient of variation method. The objective weight of the indicator is 
determined based on the analytic hierarchy process; then the integrated scoring model is used to 
comprehensively calculate the normalized indicator value and weight value to obtain the evaluation analysis 
result; finally, the method is verified by empirical analysis Effectiveness. 
1 Introduction  
In recent years, as the scale of distribution network 
construction continues to increase, the construction tasks 
continue to increase. Carrying out the analysis and 
evaluation of the carrying capacity of the owner's project 
department can further standardize the entire process 
management of the distribution network construction.  
At present, there are relatively few literature references 
for the evaluation and analysis of the carrying capacity of 
the owner's project department. Literature [1] constructed a 
carrying capacity analysis model from the aspect of the 
work intensity of the dispatching personnel of the power 
company to test the rationality of the dispatching 
personnel. Literature [2] constructed a bearing capacity 
calculation model and established a research methodology 
of the normative system, which provided theoretical basis 
and practical experience for carrying out research on 
bearing capacity. Literature [3] analyzed in detail the work 
carrying capacity of the front-line teams of power supply 
companies, 
and 
summarized 
the 
problems 
and 
optimization measures in the work carrying capacity of the 
teams. Literature [4] conducts early-warning control of the 
carrying capacity and risk of subcontractors to meet the 
needs of rapid development of the power grid and the 
implementation of lean management. Literature [5] is based 
on the application of the horizontal road map method, 
through the establishment of a calculation model, visual 
analysis of power construction management staffing, 
using objective data for review, providing data support for 
project risk management, so as to improve the rationality 
of staffing.  
The above-mentioned documents provide certain 
methods and theoretical support for carrying out load-
bearing evaluation, but they are not sufficiently integrated 
with 
the 
characteristics 
of 
distribution 
network 
management and management status. Therefore, starting 
from 
the 
characteristics 
of 
distribution 
network 
management and combining the owner’s project 
department management specifications, this paper 
constructs a carrying capacity evaluation and analysis 
index system and evaluation method, and verifies the 
effectiveness of the model through empirical analysis.The 
specific research ideas of this paper are shown in Figure 1

2 Construction of a comparative 
evaluation model for the carrying 
capacity of the project department of 
the distribution network owner 
2.1 Construction of the evaluation index system 
for carrying capacity  
The construction of the evaluation index system for the 
carrying capacity of the owner’s project department is 
based on the standardized management manual of the 
owner’s project department of the distribution network 
project, the owner’s project department’s performance 
checklist and other normative system documents, from the 
dimensions of the owner’s project department staffing and 
process management of the distribution network project. 
The design of the carrying capacity index focuses on the 
performance of the owner’s project department in terms of 
the quality, schedule, and cost of the distribution network 
project. In order to comprehensively improve the 
operability and leadership of the evaluation work, the 
benchmarking index system is constructed as follows:

2.2 Evaluation weight determination  
2.2.1 Principles and steps of analytic hierarchy 
process  
Analytic Hierarchy Process (Analytic Hierarchy Process 
for short AHP) first refines and decomposes the decision-
making problem into different target layers, each of which 
represents an important part of the decision-making 
problem, and then combines the method of solving the 
judgment matrix according to the rating criteria and 
evaluation specifications , Calculate the feature vector to 
get the weight corresponding to each target layer element, 
and finally use the weighted sum method to calculate the 
final weight of each alternative plan corresponding to the 
total target, and the one with the largest weight is the 
optimal plan.  
(1) First, build a hierarchical structure, decompose the 
decision-making problems in detail, and organize them 
into a top-to-bottom hierarchical structure. Complex 
problems are decomposed into multiple core elements. 
When applying AHP to analyze decision-making 
problems, the responsible problem is first decomposed 
into multiple elements, and then the elements are 
decomposed into several levels according to the attributes 
of the elements, and finally a hierarchical problem 
structure model is constructed as the basis of the analytic 
hierarchy process. 
(2) Construct a judgment matrix In order to reflect the 
weight correspondence between each element, it is 
necessary to construct a judgment matrix. Generally, the 
1-9 scale method is used, and the numbers 1-9 and its 
reciprocal are used as the scale to evaluate the 
correspondence between the elements.  
(3) Single ranking consistency test Generally, the

consistency index CI is used to test whether the judgment 
matrix is reasonable in design and whether there are 
logical errors. It is generally believed that when CI<0.10, 
the judgment matrix is reasonable. 
(4) Total ranking consistency test After the consistency 
of a single sort meets the requirements, the consistency 
test of the total sort is also required. If the test passes, the 
current weight ranking results can be used as the final 
decision basis. 
2.2.2 Coefficient of Variation Method  
The coefficient of variation method is a method to 
calculate the degree of change of the system indicators 
based on statistical methods, and is an objective weighting 
method. According to this method, the weight of the index 
with larger change difference is larger, and the weight of 
index with smaller change difference is smaller, so that the 
importance of the index is determined according to the 
statistical law of the index. The coefficient of variation 
method is a relatively objective method, which can 
objectively reflect the change information of the index 
data, and this method can obtain the weight of each index 
more objectively. Each indicator is weighted according to 
the degree of variation between the current value of each 
evaluation indicator and the target value. When the current 
value of each indicator has a large gap with the target value, 
it means that the indicator is difficult to achieve the target 
value and should be given a greater weight. Otherwise, it 
should be given a smaller weight.  
(1) Assuming that there are n samples to be evaluated 
and p evaluation indicators, the original indicator data 
matrix is formed:

3 Empirical analysis 
Select 9 municipal power supply companies under a 
provincial power company as the research objects, collect 
relevant data, combine the coefficient of variation method 
and the analytic hierarchy process to get the corresponding

According to the evaluation results, it can be seen that 
the carrying capacity level of E area is the most 
outstanding. The performance of indicators such as the 
investment scale and the standard support ratio of 
personnel, the support ratio of the project manager’s 
working life, and the saturation of the qualifications of the 
project department personnel are all outstanding, and 
other indicators The performance is relatively balanced, so 
the evaluation result of the carrying capacity of the E area 
ranks first. In the follow-up, the advanced management 
experience of the E area must be further explored to 
improve the management level.  
4 Conclusion
