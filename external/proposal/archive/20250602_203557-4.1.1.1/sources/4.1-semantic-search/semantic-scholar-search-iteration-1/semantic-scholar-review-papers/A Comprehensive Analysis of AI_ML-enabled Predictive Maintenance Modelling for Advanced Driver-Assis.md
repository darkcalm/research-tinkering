Technological advances like ADAS and AI in cars present societal
challenges and opportunities. It shows how AI aids human-machine
communication by improving motor skills. The auto industry is
interested in ADAS because it can increase energy efficiency, safety,
and comfort. Numerous studies have shown its benefits. ADAS and
vehicle networking show promise, but establishing a sound control
system is challenging. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is one
answer to these problems. To manage higher-level connectivity and
automation, the paper analyses and implements key research. It also
finds issues and recommends solutions. The latest driverless car
ADAS improvements have dramatically increased passenger safety.
These systems are safer and more automated using sensors and
ECUs. Most ADAS have RADAR, cameras, ultrasonic, and LiDAR.
This work uses AI/ML-enabled Predictive Maintenance modelling to
improve ADAS safety and longevity. AI and ML in Advanced Driver
Assistance Systems (ADAS) are significant vehicle safety and
reliability advances. AI/ML-enabled predictive maintenance detects
and fixes ADAS component faults. ADAS predictive maintenance
using AI/ML can detect issues, improve driver safety, and boost
vehicle efficiency. Advanced sensor arrays and control units are
needed for adaptive cruise control, traffic sign recognition, and
lane-keeping assistance. AI/ML algorithms discover issues and
enable early interventions in predictive maintenance models.
Predictive maintenance is examined utilizing classical machine
learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. Integration of
numerous AI/ML models, real-time data processing, customization
based on vehicle usage patterns, scalability, and adaptability of
predictive maintenance models to new ADAS technologies are
research gaps.
