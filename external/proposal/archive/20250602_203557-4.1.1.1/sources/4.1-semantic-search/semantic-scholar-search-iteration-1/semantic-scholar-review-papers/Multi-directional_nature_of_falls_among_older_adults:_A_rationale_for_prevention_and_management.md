1. Falls as a focal issue for older adults
The global aging population is larger than ever before (1), and it is estimated that 155
countries will have an aging society by the year 2050 (2). In the United States alone, there
are more than 50 million adults ages 65 years and older, with this sub-population projected
to exceed more than 80 million by 2040 (3). The growing aging population reﬂects longer
life expectancies largely attributed to a combination of medical advancements, accessible
healthcare, and supportive and inclusive physical and social environments (4). While there
is much variability in the aging process (5), the expansive older adult population brings with
it increased prevalence rates of chronic conditions and other health issues (e.g., injurious
falls, cognitive decline, malnutrition, mental illness, and social disconnectedness) that will
further strain the already over-burdened healthcare system. While there are many pressing
and costly geriatric conditions deserving of increased and immediate attention, we will focus
on older adult falls as an example of a globally-recognized, age-related condition with a
host of negative, but potentially preventable, sequelae (6, 7). Too often falls are narrowly
viewed as a natural and inevitable part of aging, which cannot be prevented or managed.
The complex and multi-factorial circumstances resulting in a fall require a more holistic
view of the event (i.e., causes, facilitators, and contributors) and the older adults’ physical,
mental, environmental, and medical context. We contend that falls is among the most
germane health issues facing older adults because a fall can represent a constellation of
interwoven health events and may be centric to multi-level solutions spanning research,
healthcare practice, community programming, and policy. This article aims to expand the
lens through which we view falls as a public health issue by: (a) oﬀering insights about the
upstream indicators and downstream ramiﬁcations associated with falls; and (b) highlighting
opportunities for interdisciplinary and cross-sectorial solutions to predict, prevent, and
manage falls among older adults.
Falls in the United States are the leading cause of unintentional injuries among older
adults age 65 years and older (8). The incidence of falls is substantial, with one-in-four older
adults falling each year (9). Older adults who fall have an increased risk for injury, reduced
physical function, loss of independence, institutionalization, and death (9, 10). The estimated
annual direct medical costs of falls exceed $50 billion USD (11), which does not account for
the associated costs for rehabilitation, caregiving, skilled nursing, or other resulting health
issues (physical or mental). The ramiﬁcations of a fall dramatically impact the older adult,
but when considered collectively, these negative consequences impose extreme duress on
their families, social structures, and the clinical and community-based organizations that
serve them. Although the likelihood of falling increases with age, it is not a natural part of
aging. Falls are not inevitable; rather, they are largely preventable. The causes of falls are
vast, individualistic, situational, and often interrelated. They include intrinsic and extrinsic
factors, which are biological, behavioral, and environmental (12).

Given the common, complex, and severe nature of falls among
older adults, we need to challenge the way we think about
falls (13, 14). As researchers, clinicians, and community service
providers, we should view falls as a multi-directional occurrence
and recognize that the fall itself may not be the focal issue. As
depicted in Figure 1, falls can be expressed in multiple ways and
take on many roles within the lives of older adults. A fall can be
an outcome that is the result of a set of personal or environmental
circumstances, a sign or symptom of an underlying health issue,
and/or a cause of or trigger for subsequent health consequences. As
such, when an older adult presents with a fall, we must holistically
assess the person and event to determine the role of the fall within
the situational context. There is a need to screen the older adult,
perform physical and cognitive assessments, and ask questions of
the family and loved ones to understand the situational context and
address the upstream and downstream correlates of the fall.
2. Select examples of multi-directional
fall-related risk
In many instances, a contributing reason for a fall (risk factor)
is also aﬀected after a fall. This creates a scenario where the same
risk factor can contribute to a fall, emerge after a fall occurs, or
intensify after a fall when present prior to a fall. As such, there
are opportunities to address these factors both before and after
a fall, yet the strategies and interventions may be consistent or
uniquely tailored based on the context of fall and other existing
risks/complications. To illustrate this point, we provide six selective
examples below to describe the multi-directionality of these risk
factors as related to fall prevention (before) and management
(after). However, it must be recognized that after a fall occurs, both
management and prevention eﬀorts are needed because part of
managing a fall is preventing a repeated or subsequent fall.
Fear of falling is a known risk factor for falling because
the fear itself causes older adults to avoid performing certain
actions, movements, and activities (15). This fear, in turn,
often results in muscular atrophy and reduced lower limb
strength/balance/ﬂexibility, which can contribute to the older adult
being unsteady on their feet when they are mobile and attempt
to perform certain activities. While fear of falling can contribute
to a fall, the fear of falling can emerge or escalate after an older
adult experiences a fall (16), especially in instances where an injury
occurred. Many fall prevention interventions now include attention
to strategies to acknowledge and reduce fear of falling.
Physical activity is a protective factor against falls in that it
promotes circulatory health and lower extremity strength, balance,
and ﬂexibility (17). A variety of physical activities and exercises are
recommended to promote postural stability and fall prevention,
which should be performed consistently over time and become
progressively more challenging for the older adult over time
(depending on their functional mobility and ability levels). While
physical activity is largely protective, in some instances, it can
introduce opportunities for falling among older adults based on
internal, situational, and environmental factors. After a fall, there is
an increased likelihood of physical inactivity or sedentary behavior,
especially if the fall resulted in a fracture (e.g., hip, pelvis, and
femur) or traumatic brain injury. As such, it is essential to
promote physical activity at all ages but allow an older adult
ample time to rest and recuperate after a fall before introducing
rehabilitation activities (i.e., to regain physical mobility and avoid
lower extremity atrophy).
Medication, and especially polypharmacy, is a risk factor for
falling because the side eﬀects may inﬂuence blood pressure and
other biological functions that can cause dizziness and postural
hypotension (18). When an older adult takes multiple medications
simultaneously, the opportunities for negative interaction eﬀects
amplify, as can the associated side eﬀects, that can cause decreased
consciousness (e.g., blackouts and fainting) or general postural
unsteadiness. After a fall occurs, especially a fall with injury, the
activities and lifestyle behaviors of a person may change during
recovery. They may be prescribed prescription pain relievers,
which may create interaction eﬀect issues with existing medication
regimens and medication non-adherence issues (e.g., dose, timing,
and food accompaniment). Further, the biological processing of
the medication may change after a fall because of resulting
changes in mobility, diet (appetite suppression from prescription
pain relievers), and sleep patterns. Increasing recognition of these
medication-related risks have prompted doctors and pharmacists
to perform routine checks of medication usage, and cross-reference
for potential interaction eﬀects, during each medical encounter.
Nutrition, and especially malnutrition, is an important and
often unrecognized risk factor for falls and lower limb functioning
(19–22). Protein-rich diets among older adults, which impact
muscle mass and strength, may prevent the occurrence of a fall as
well as accelerate the recovery time after an injurious fall (23, 24).
Proper and balanced diets can provide the bones and muscles
suﬃcient strength and functioning needed to accommodate to
changing functional capacities with aging. Beyond access to
healthful and aﬀordable foods, older adults may beneﬁt from
nutritional supplements to bolster daily protein consumption and
muscular function.
Loneliness, and overall social disconnectedness, is a risk factor
for falls because older adults feeling isolated from others may be
socially excluded or have limited support networks, thus hindering
their social activities and exacerbating other risk factors associated
with falls (e.g., depression, cognitive impairment, sedentary
behavior, and substance use) (25). After a fall, older adults may
become homebound or have limited community-based mobility,
which can hinder their ability to perform instrumental activities of
daily living and limit meaningful interactions with others, which
can cause feelings of loneliness, isolation, and disconnectedness.
This situation can be especially impact older adults without robust
social networks to meet their needs and keep them socially engaged
(e.g., those residing alone).
Home and Community Environments are seen as a major
extrinsic risk factors for falls both within the home and in the
community (26, 27). Environmental factors can be associated
with common trips and slips among older adults with declining
physical capacities to compensate for environmental hazards,
while environmental modiﬁcations can reduce fall-related risk
by introducing handrails, grab bars, and ample lighting within
homes and areas frequented by older adults (28). Similarly, to
reduce falls risk, there is greater appreciation of the importance of
having safe, navigable outdoor environments with amenities such
as crosswalks/pedestrian signals, seating for rest, and lighting/shade

in recreational areas and places where older adults engage in
utilitarian activities (29, 30). After a fall, older adults may be
unable to drive or travel freely within their community (e.g., due
to injury, immobility, or pain medication), which may limit their
ability to run errands or go to doctor’s appointments necessary
for rehabilitation. Further, they may be unable to clean or pick-
up clutter around the home, which may create or contribute to
in-home fall-related hazards.
3. Solutions to advance fall prevention
and management
Like many geriatric health issues, fall-related risks are
multi-factorial and therefore require multi-factorial solutions
and
a
diverse,
multi-disciplinary
team/workforce
to:
(a)
reduce incidence and prevalence rates; and (b) help older
adults overcome the fall after it occurs. While the fall itself
is a focal point for intervention, it is often indicative of
other issues occurring within the older adult’s life, which
highlights our need to recognize and address the complexities
of
upstream
indicators
and
downstream
ramiﬁcations.
Therefore, we must be simultaneously reactive and proactive
to address falls and fall-related risk comprehensively within
our communities.
Multi-level
approaches
are
needed
to
adequately
and
comprehensively prevent and manage falls among older adults.
At the individual level, eﬀorts are needed to routinely assess
fall-related risk among older adults independently from, and
within the context of, other known risk factors. As an example, in
the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) developed a comprehensive toolkit, STopping Elderly
Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries (STEADI) to help healthcare
professionals screen and assess for fall-related risk and make
tailored referrals to specialists and community-based programs
(31). While fall screening is useful in the falls context, additional
eﬀorts are needed to uniformly assess other associated risk factors
such as malnutrition, sedentary behavior, loneliness, physical and
cognitive functioning, and sleep problems. Such risk inventories
interpreted in a falls context, and reviewed with multi-disciplinary
teams in healthcare and community settings can elevate fall
prevention eﬀorts and assist to mitigate fall-related ramiﬁcations,
if a fall occurs. The amassing body of intervention research
conﬁrms that the most successful fall prevention programs are
those that are multifactorial and multicomponent (32). As such,
within the United States’ aging services network, there are many
evidence-based fall prevention programs disseminated at the
national, state, and local levels (33). These interventions are critical
to address intrinsic and extrinsic fall-related risks to prevent and
manage older adult falls. However, to reach a suﬃcient number
of older adults with eﬀective programming, a diverse delivery
infrastructure is needed that includes healthcare, community
non-proﬁt, residential, faith-based, government, education, and
industry partners (34, 35). Then, after establishing infrastructure,

dedicated eﬀorts and funding are needed for program scalability
and sustainability (36). At the community level, the creation
of national- and state-based coalitions (or task forces, action
alliances, etc.) to address falls and other issues facing older adults
have great potential to unify eﬀorts and embed evidence-based
solutions and best practices across communities over time and
geography (37–39). Further, the United States has an active age-
friendly communities movement, which encourages attention to
environmental and policy issues to support livable and connected
communities that facilitate increased physical activity, access
to resources, and social interactions (i.e., thereby ameliorating
important fall risks) (40, 41).
The Otago Exercise Program (OEP) is an example of an
eﬀective fall prevention program that ﬁts within a multi-level fall
prevention framework and fosters multi-sectorial collaboration and
action (13, 42). Adopted in the United States from New Zealand
(43, 44), OEP is an innovative model of in-home, one-on-one
physical therapy sessions targeting frailer older adults. These home-
bound older adults are the primary audience for this program
because they are typically older, have more comorbidities, face
more environmental and social challenges, and are at greater risk
for recurring falls. Based on the older adult’s risk and ability
levels, the physical therapist engages participants in 17 strength
and balance exercises over a series of six visits. The intensity
of exercises is progressively increased to improve older adults’
lower-limb strength, balance, and ﬂexibility. OEP is complemented
by a weekly walking program to assist participants be more
active between physical therapy visits and encourage mobility
outside the home (45). Older adults are often referred to OEP
by healthcare providers following a clinical risk assessment (e.g.,
STEADI) or being discharged after a fall (46). After participating
in OEP, participants are often referred to other evidence-based
fall prevention programs in community settings (e.g., A Matter
of Balance, Stepping On, Tai Chi: Moving for Better Balance) so
they can continue to mitigate fall-related risk and become more
physically active. OEP has been shown to signiﬁcantly improve
participants’ functional performance (i.e., Timed Up-and-Go,
30-Second Chair Stand, Four-Stage Balance Test) (47, 48). Based
on these outcomes, OEP was translated so it could reach more
older adults and be implemented in more clinical and community
settings. As a result, OEP has been translated for delivery in group
and community settings, facilitation by non-physical therapists
(e.g., certiﬁed occupational therapy assistants, lay leaders of
evidence-based programs) (48, 49), and virtual dissemination using
an avatar-guided platform (50). These translated OEP versions
have also demonstrated eﬀectiveness, respectively. The delivery
and evolution of OEP illustrate the importance of cross-sectoral
screening, referral, and intervention to identify frail home-bound
older adults needing assistance and assist them prevent and
overcome falls.
Oﬀering
multi-level,
multi-sectoral
solutions
in
the
United States is consistent with the global initiatives promulgated
by the United Nations’ Decade of Healthy Aging (2021–2030),
which gives concrete actions for making healthy aging a global
reality (51). Because falls are a central and complex health issue
impacting the older population, coordinated multi-level research,
practice, and policy eﬀorts are needed to understand the many
roles of falls, its drivers, and its consequences. Considering a fall
can be an outcome, sign or symptom, or cause or trigger, it is
necessary that we examine the context of each fall among older
adults to gain a holistic view of their health risks and conditions.
As a society, at all levels, we must proactively screen, assess, refer,
intervene, treat, and follow-up with our older adults to prevent falls
and protect older adults from related (and potentially preventable)
sequelae. In the coming decade, we must view and prioritize falls as
a pressing health issue within the aging population and collectively
advocate for multi-level solutions spanning research, healthcare
practice, community programming, and policy.
4. Conclusions
The situations and circumstances surrounding a fall are
complex and should be viewed as a multi-directional occurrence.
Researchers, practitioners, and policy makers must challenge the
way they think about falls and recognize that the fall itself may
not be the focal issue. Collectively, we must assess the upstream
indicators and downstream ramiﬁcations of falls and identify
practical and eﬀective solutions to address these factors both before
and after a fall. While we have implemented strategies to identify
falls in clinical settings and refer at-risk older adults to evidence-
based fall prevention programs across community sectors, we
must also consider how falls ﬁt within the greater context of
other health issues (e.g., malnutrition, physical inactivity, cognitive
impairment, social disconnectedness, polypharmacy, and the built
environment). Despite our many advancements, additional multi-
level, multi-sectorial solutions are needed to prevent and manage
falls among the growing and diverse global aging population.
Our eﬀorts must span research, healthcare practice, community
programming, and policy to ensure solutions are practical, eﬀective,
replicable, scalable, and sustainable.
