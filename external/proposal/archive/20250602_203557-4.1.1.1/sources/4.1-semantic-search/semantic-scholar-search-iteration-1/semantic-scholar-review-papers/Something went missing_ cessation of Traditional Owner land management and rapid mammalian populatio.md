ABSTRACT: The nineteenth century mass mammal extinctions in the semi-arid zone of the Murray‒Darling basin, southeastern 
Australia, are examined in the context of prior traditional land management. A model of grassland dynamics reveals a multi-
trophic level productive pulse one to five years post-fire, followed by senescence and increasing flammability. Traditional 
Owner patch burning of grassland optimized human and mammalian food (including tubers, seeds and fungi) and decreased fire 
risk. Over at least 40 000 years, the persistence and abundance of fauna responded to this energetically closed self-reinforcing 
management. In 1830, depopulation (disease, massacres and displacement) effectively ended traditional management, an 
ecologically traumatic event that extinguished these productivity pulses. Associated mammal populations of c. 20 species 
collapsed, and all eco-engineering and mycophagous species, such as bilbies, bettongs and bandicoots, rapidly disappeared.
Traditional land management increased productivity, habitat heterogeneity and reduced wildfire risk, underpinning mammal 
abundance. This has remained unrecognized by most mammalogists and land managers. Blaming extinctions predominantly 
on the additions by Europeans (introduction of ungulates, feral grazers and predators etc.), disastrous as they were, fails to 
acknowledge the initial cause of rarity, i.e. loss of productivity, habitat and niches when traditional management was subtracted 
from country. As ecosystems continue to degrade, understanding the primary cause is fundamental to improved management. 
Although too late for extinct species, respect for, and inclusion of, traditional land management knowledge provides a direction 
for future land management.
Keywords: nineteenth century mammal extinctions, Traditional Owner land management, native grasslands, lower Murray‒
Darling, semi-arid, patch burning
INTRODUCTION
From a broad range of evidence (archaeological, 
anthropological, historical and ecological) this paper 
examines the collapse of the mammalian fauna of the mid 
Murray‒Darling in the mid-nineteenth century (Figure 1).
1.	 Although well studied, the arguments for the rapid 
mass extinctions of mammals (1840‒1890s) in the 
semi-arid mid Murray‒Darling basin (and elsewhere) 
are essentially based on the additions by Europeans to 
land management (ungulates, rabbits, feral predators, 
land modification). Yet these do not adequately explain 
the rapidity or the timing of these declines across the 
entire landscape. Many species greatly reduced in 
abundance before the introduction of foxes, rabbits 
and hares and before the establishment of dense 
populations of feral cats.
2.	 Burbidge and Mackenzie (1989) found that semi-arid-
zone mammals in a Critical Weight Range (35 g to 5.5 kg, 
high metabolic rate cf. reptiles and less mobile than 
birds) had the worst extinction record (1840‒1980s). 
They attributed the fundamental cause to the loss of 
biological productivity of the region (including the 
export of nutrients from European pastoralism). The 
size of these mammals strongly implicated the cat and 
fox as extinction vectors, while changed fire regimes 
were acknowledged as a possible contributing factor.
3.	 We present a model of grassland and fire that shows a 
productivity pulse of biota across trophic levels (fungi, 
tubers, invertebrates, mammals) that occurs one to five 
years post-fire (slightly extended in arid grasslands). 
Without fire, this productive pulse does not occur 
and senescence becomes evident within a decade. 
We contend that Traditional Owner land management 
(hereafter TO-LM) used fire to repeatedly create this 
pulse in grasslands and grassy field layer environments, 
thus providing predictable food resources. A suite of

mammals adapted to this pulse providing increased 
food resources to the Traditional Owners.
4.	 Traditional Owner patch burning also created ecotones, 
lessened the extent of wildfires and increased the extent 
of mature vegetation and habitat heterogeneity, all of 
which benefited mammal populations and assisted 
persistence of Traditional Owner populations in this 
drought-prone region. The entire region was thus 
managed, more or less intensively, dependent on local 
ecological conditions.
5.	 Many of the 24 mammal species that became extinct 
in the region (Menkhorst 2009; Dickman 1994) were 
directly associated with this productive pulse through 
their diet and habitat, e.g. mycophagous species 
and more specialist herbivores (four peramelids, 
four potorids, a bilby and rodents). The more direct 
association the quicker their disappearance. The ‘eco-
engineering’ of many mammals made the fire-induced 
pulse more stable and ecologically productive across 
trophic levels. This system was very productive yet 
highly vulnerable in the absence of burning.
6.	 This region supported high densities of Traditional 
Owners economically reliant on riverine and grassland 
resources. Although continued in remote areas, 
burning of country effectively ceased at the landscape 
scale after 1830 due to depopulation (caused by 
disease, massacres, trauma and dispersal). This was 
also an ecologically traumatic event with immediate 
effects that cascaded through ecosystems. We argue 
that it was the subtraction of millennia-long TO-LM, 
particularly their use of patch burning, that caused the 
rapid decline in landscape productivity and mammal 
populations entering the extinction vortex.
7.	 Our argument is both: 
a)	 a variation on the fire-induced ‘mosaic hypothesis’ 
which has had an inconclusive literature and 
experimentation since first postulated by Bolton and 
Latz (1978) for the Mala (Lagorchestes hirsutus) in 
the Tanami Desert (Short & Turner 1994; Hiscock & 
Wallis 2005), and
b)	 supportive of Allen’s (1983) thesis that vegetation 
succession in the decades following cessation of 
TO-LM was the critical factor in the collapse of the 
mammal fauna in the region.
	
The post-fire, time-bound, productive, multi-trophic 
level pulse described here adds evidence to these 
postulates and explains the rapidity of decline.
8.	 The ecological and historical processes we describe 
for the mid Murray‒Darling basin in the mid-
nineteenth century were a fundamental driver of 
mammalian extinction across the arid and semi-arid 
zones of the continent, and thus a major contributory 
factor to Australia’s mammal extinction record, widely 
acknowledged as the worst globally (Woinarski et al. 
2015).
Problems with ‘solely the additions’ arguments
While acknowledging the range of environmentally 
degrading 
processes 
accompanying 
European 
dispossession, we contend that these additions were 
subsequent to the initial subtraction — the ecological trauma 
following the cessation of TO-LM. Habitat destruction and 
fragmentation, grazing by introduced ungulates (sheep, 
goats and cattle), introductions of rabbits and predation by 
the Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) and the feral Cat (Felis catus) 
have been highlighted by standard texts in mammalogy as 
the major causes of the initial and consequent extinctions 
of Australian mammal fauna (Gould 1863; Jones 1923; 
Troughton 1973; Ride 1970; Menkhorst 1995) including 
specific studies in the region (Menkhorst 2009; Bennett 
et al. 1989; Dickman 1994). TO-LM has been largely 
ignored, but perhaps sometimes hidden, under ‘changed 
fire regimes’.
In examining the mammalian declines in western NSW, 
Dickman (1994) found 50% of the species became extinct 
in the region and of the 27 species remaining 33% have 
declined. He identified feral cats as the major factor for 
the first extinction wave (from the 1840s). TO-LM was not 
mentioned. Our reading of the records of early explorers 
(Hovell & Hume 1831; Mitchell 1834; Sturt 1833; Eyre 
1845) did not find any mention of cats in the arid and semi-
arid zones. Interpretation of negative evidence is fraught, 
however, if either common or observed as an oddity, it is 
likely that cats would have been noted. The first records 
of cats in the region appear to be as adjuncts to squatter 
homesteads. Although feral cats can survive without 
drinking water, Jones (1923) concluded that their expansion 
into the arid and semi-arid regions was facilitated by the 
food and burrows provided by rabbits (i.e. not before the 
1880s), when they were often released in the forlorn hope 
of controlling rabbits (Rolls 1969), thus suggesting their 
effective absence. Similarly, rabbits and foxes did not arrive 
in the region until after the 1880s (Burch 2017; Menkhorst 
2009), when expansion of stock water points later in the 
nineteenth century probably assisted these species.
Early explorers (e.g. Sturt, Ayer and Mitchell) provided 
information on the early mammalian fauna of the semi-
arid zone, but the presence of the Blandowski expedition 
(1856‒57) within the region provided the first (and for over 
a century, the only) systematic collection of the regional 
fauna (Menkhorst 1995). Krefft (1865a,b) collated the 
records of that expedition and the observations on the 
Traditional Owners. He was reliant on the extant Nyeri 
Nyeri elders (and others) for specimen collection and

information, and these records were a vector for traditional 
knowledge (Krefft 1865a,b; Wakefield 1966; Allen 1972). 
Two of his observations are frequently referenced (e.g. 
Menkhorst 1995). The Pig-footed Bandicoot (Chaeropus 
ecaudatus), common when first recorded by Mitchell in 
1836, had become ‘exceedingly rare, and disappearing 
as fast as the native population. The large flocks of sheep 
and cattle occupying the country will soon disperse those 
individuals which are still to be found in the so-called 
settled districts’ (Krefft 1865a). Subsequent mammologists 
used this observation to blame the sheep and cattle. He also 
noted (p. 16) that the Greater Bilby (Macrotis lagotis) … 
‘like so many other species, has long ago retreated to north 
of the Murray’. We suggest that ‘long ago’ is more likely to 
be 20 than 10 years. The Traditional Owner population and 
economy had collapsed (around 1830) following smallpox 
and subsequent diseases (see below). Krefft (1865b), and 
many others, observed a remnant Indigenous population 
and had no interest in understanding (and probably little 
capacity to envisage) the prior economy and TO-LM. It 
would take over a century for western science to recognize 
the ecological agency of Traditional Owners (e.g. Tindale 
1959; Rose 1987).
The early stage of the squatters’ invasion (observed 
by Krefft) began in the early 1840s to the 1860s, later 
in the northern Riverina (Kenyon 1914–15; Allen 1983; 
Boyce 2011; Ballinger 2011; Burch 2017). Past TO-LM 
managed grasslands were the major object of this imperial 
endeavour. However, in this semi-arid zone, water was also 
critical for cattle and sheep (within about 8 km) and farm 
dams (later mallee tanks and artesian wells) would only 
become established from the 1870s. The early effects of 
‘undeveloped’ pastoralism left 75% of the Riverina and 
much of the Mallee habitat for 15 of the local mammal 
species, as it remained essentially unoccupied by squatters 
(Wakefield 1966; Allen 1983; Burch 2017). Until at least 
1865, pastoralism remained focused around the limited 
water resources and shepherds continued to secure flocks 
(from Dingos) at night (Curr 1883; Allen 1983). Most native 
species can survive well without free water (Table 3) but 
had already massively declined in the absence of extensive 
pastoralism. In parts of Central Australia the mammal 
fauna survived pastoralism for over 70 years with the 
continuation of Traditional Owner burning (Latz & Griffin 
1978). Despite its continuing reiteration, the additions 
postulate, and all its variants, appears unconvincing as 
a sole explanation and may be a function of a persistent 
European cultural perspective.
Here we show that the Traditional Owner patch burning 
created a self-reinforcing energetically closed productive 
pulse that provided them (and a suite of mammals) with 
predictable, elevated, varied, and sustainable food resources 
across the landscape. When patch burning ceased, or was 
degraded, biological productivity was lost after about five 
years. Burbidge and McKenzie (1989) identified biological 
productivity loss as the primary cause of Critical Weight 
Range mammal extinctions in the arid and semi-arid zones.
Menkhorst (2009) found loss of TO-LM plausible 
but rejected it because: a) ‘it struggles to account for the 
rapidity of the mammal declines’ as it would take some 
years to transform the fine-grain mosaic to coarse grain 
(awaiting senescence and bushfires); and b) there was scant 
evidence that Aboriginal people applied a patch-mosaic fire 
regime at a broad scale in this part of Australia. Neither of 
these reasons is sustainable on the evidence. Furthermore, 
our subtraction argument also fits the progressive loss of 
mammal species across the continent over the following 
century (e.g. Burbidge & McKenzie 1989; Latz & Griffin 
1978). If, as we contend, the cessation of TO-LM is the 
initial causal factor driving mammal extinctions, then a 
suite of expanded actions (hitherto ignored) for redress 
of the acknowledged continental declines of ecosystems 
becomes available.
Our perspectives and presumptions
Our narrative has gaps, biases and incomplete knowledge. 
Most obviously, further direct traditional knowledge would 
be welcome. The current proposition relies upon evidence 
of science and humanities and knowledge of the prior 
economy of Traditional Owner society. Understanding 
of this last is fraught with difficulties and has evolved 
over time, at least in the western mind, usually within an 
implied social evolutionist context — hence ‘primitive 
hunter gatherers’, ‘nomads’, ‘intelligent parasitism’, 
‘complex hunter-gatherers’ and ‘incipient agriculturalist’ 
to adopters of ‘agriculture’ (e.g. Elkin 1933; Meggitt 1965; 
Tindale 1959; Rose et al. 2003; Pascoe 2014; Sutton & 
Walshe 2021). Unfortunately, these definitions and related 
terminology have embedded cultural biases. We presume 
the following uncontroversial facts:
•	
	The entire landscape was occupied by Traditional 
Owners in different language groups.
•	
	Each group and individual maintained their country 
in a patchwork mosaic of different ecosystems related 
to their Dreamtime and to provide a diversity of 
predictable food resources across the seasons.
•	
	This was done in highly variable and fire-prone 
environments. Fire and grasslands were important 
elements in this provision and persisted over the 
millennia and across massive environmental change, 
particularly in the Holocene (10  000 y BP) (e.g. 
Cupper 2005).
•	
	TO-LM was based on a deep understanding of ecology 
and was incorporated into their cosmology and social

interpreted but a small part of this deep knowledge, 
recognising that a more comprehensive understanding 
awaits interpretation.
STUDY AREA
The study area encompasses land of the following 
Traditional Owner language groups: Wergaia, Latje Latje, 
Dja Dja Wurrung, Yorta Yorta, Barba Barba, Wemba 
Wemba, Wadi Wadi, Dadi Dadi, Meru, Kureinji, Barkindji, 
Barindji, Yitha Yitha, Nari Nari, Madi Madi and, to the 
east, Wiradjuri (AIATSIS 2021).This is the region with the 
most rapid mass mammalian extinctions (>20) of the mid–
late nineteenth century and is broadly defined as the parts 
of NSW, South Australia and Victoria south of latitude 32o 
S and within the mean 450 mm isohyet. It is centred on 
the confluence of the Murray and Darling rivers, which 
provide major riverine environments in this semi-arid zone. 
The boundaries of the region are somewhat arbitrary and 
should be viewed as porous; it is broadly encircled by the 
towns of Broken Hill, Wilcannia, Ivanhoe, Hay, Echuca, 
Bendigo, Nhill, Berri and Olary. Zoogeographically the 
region is within the Eyrean (arid) and Bassian (mesic) 
transition zones (semi-arid) (Blakers et al. 1984).
The modelled mapping of vegetation 1750, compiled 
by National Vegetation Information System (NVIS 2017) 
was used to extract the Major Vegetation Groups (MVG), 
and their Major Vegetation Subgroups (MVS #) dominated 
by a grassy or chenopod-grassy field layer were extracted 
sto describe five broad structural vegetation types for the 
study area (Figure 1a). These were: Tussock Grasslands, 
Eucalypt Woodlands, Casuarina Woodlands, Acacia 
Open Woodlands and Shrublands, Mallee Woodlands 
and Shrublands and Mallee Open Woodlands and Sparse 
Shrublands, and Chenopod Shrublands. A variety of grassy 
field  layers is ubiquitous across the landscape under all 
overstorey categories. The current extent of vegetation 
is shown in Figure 1b. The cleared land is essentially 
cropland and exotic pasture and the remaining, rangelands 
with a depleted MVG overstorey and a much-degraded 
field and shrub layer due to ungulate and European Rabbit 
grazing. The area of semi-arid national parks and reserve 
system in Victoria is about one million ha (Figure 1b). In 
Victoria, seven Ecological Vegetation Divisions occur in 
the region (Cheal 2010). All vegetation groups have been 
degraded, with most communities of grasslands and grassy 
woodlands having been cleared or otherwise grossly 
changed such that they are now considered threatened, e.g. 
Buloke Woodlands (Sluiter 1997); Box Mallee Woodlands 
(Sluiter & Schultz 2020); and Victorian Grassy Woodlands 
(Cresswell & Murphy 2016). 
The plains of the Murray‒Darling comprised warm-
season (C4) grasslands that were a very productive, 
high turnover ecosystem with their health and extent 
conditioned by regenerative fire regimes. In places, grasses 
dominate the field layer under open canopies (e.g. grassy 
woodlands) and can be an early seral stage in gaps in 
forests, restricted to riparian zones. The seral stages of 
grasslands are relatively rapid for terrestrial ecosystems 
and are measured in years rather than decades (Cheal 2010; 
McIvor 2005; Williams & Morgan 2015) (Table 1, Figure 
3). However, when unburnt or overgrazed, short, either 
cool-season annuals (e.g. Avena, Bromus, Hordeum and 
Lolium spp.) or shrubs (e.g. Atriplex, Maireana, Rhagodia) 
become dominant (McIvor 2005).
Late Quaternary Vegetation of the study area
Basic vegetation types (and habitat) are expressions of soil, 
climate, available genetic plant and fungi material as well 
as fire and grazing regimes (fauna) that change over time. 
Whatever the combination of causes of the extinction of 
Australia’s megafauna (climate, human, fire) around 46 000 
y BP the continent’s vegetation transitioned to become more 
flammable and fire-tolerant. Grasses (Poaceae) and tuber-
forming taxa have been a feature of the southern Victorian 
plains for over 30 000 years (Canning 2009). In southeastern 
Australia there was lower biological activity under cooler 
conditions (3‒5° C less than present), drier conditions and 
less surface water 33‒12 K y BP with higher lake levels 
in early–mid Holocene (9‒4  000 y BP) (Cupper 2005). 
The palaeobotanical record indicates that the vegetation 
in the region has undergone extensive change since the 
early Holocene (10–6.6 Ky BP) and around the 300 mm 
isohyet, mallee vegetation moved back and forth across 
the landscape (Bailey 1979; Cupper 2005). At that time 
Casuarinaceae woodland and chenopod shrublands (on 
dunes) dominated the landscape, but by the mid-Holocene 
(6.6‒2.2 Ky BP) the woodland had been replaced by mallee 
and Callitris thickets, with mallee domination in the last 
800 years (Luly 1990; Cupper 2005; Sluiter & Parsons 
2012a,b; Sluiter 2008). Within these fluxes and variegated 
landscapes, grasslands and vegetation dominated by grassy 
field layers persisted at various scales (Figures 1a & 2). 
At various temporal and spatial scales, the abundance and 
distribution of fauna would have responded, sometimes in 
refugia andsometimes in radiation (Canning 2009). It was 
across these changing and variegated landscapes that TO 
societies and economies adapted. By 7000 y BP along the 
Darling River, the Barkindji diet consisted of 40% cereals. 
The lacustrine economy of Mungo man (c. 42 000 y BP) 
had changed to riverine grassland (Allen 1972). At the 
same time, Willandra Lakes archaeological sites (6 of 7) 
revealed that the vast majority of mammalian game was 
small to medium grassland species, not large macropods, 
which is a common ratio in archaeological sites across 
Australia (Allen 1972).

METHODS
Ecology of grassland biota, fire and ecotones
The abundance and vigour of the dominant grasses 
and associated tuber- and rhizome-forming species, 
their responses to fire and the tolerable fire intervals are 
reasonably well understood (e.g. Zimmer 1940; Parsons 
1981; Morgan & Lunt 1999; McIvor 2005; Cheal 2010). An 
idealized model of the life history of the tall, warm season 
grasslands (Themeda, Homopholis, Bothriochloa, Chloris, 
Enteropogon, Eragrostis, Panicum spp. dominant), 
associated biota and fire was created from data in Morgan 
and Lunt (1999), from reviews and studies concerning the 
fire responses of fungi (McMullan-Fisher et al. 2011) and 
invertebrates (York 1999; York & Lewis 2017) and from 
the ecological strategies of the formerly super-abundant 
Bogong Moth (Agrotis infusa) (Warrant et al. 2016; Green 
et al. 2021). Data on major food sources utilized and 
cultivated by the Traditional Owners were examined, as 
were the diets of the extinct mammals (e.g. Latz 1995a; 
Strahan 1998a; Gott 2005). Literature of the humanities 
(anthropological, 
historical) 
and 
physical 
sciences 
(ecology, fire behaviour) were examined for evidence of 
the effects of patch burning on ecological processes at 
the landscape scale. Fire creates an area of ecotone on 
the burnt perimeter, often favoured by mammals, which 
we conservatively defined as 25 m either side of the fire 
boundary enabling us to calculate the ratio of burnt area to 
ecotone for fires over a square of between 1 and 1000 ha.
Traditional Owner use of fire and land-use history
Western science generally describes fire regimes in terms 
of frequency, seasonality, extent and intensity/severity. 
However, we recognize that this generalized instrument 
is inappropriate for describing the fine-grained mosaic 
burning of Traditional Owners, who maintained their 
‘country’ for a variety of reasons within their dreaming, e.g. 
hunting and food gathering, specific habitat maintenance, 
woody weed encroachment, pest control and bushfire 
management (Gammage 2012; Skroblin et al. 2017, Cahir 
& McMaster 2018; Stefferson 2020; Sutton & Walshe 
2021). Primary records of explorers (e.g. Hovell & Hume 
1831; Sturt 1848; Mitchell 1838), squatters and other 
observers (e.g. Curr 1886; Clark 1998), early ethnographers 
(e.g. Dawson 2009; Howitt 1904) and land-use historians 
(Kenyon 1914–15; Randell 1982; Hateley 2010; Burch 
2017) were examined for evidence of traditional land use 
and management, cultural practices and fauna noting that 
these are all ‘European’ sources.
These sources were complemented by archaeological, 
palaeobotanical and anthropological literature of the 
region and elsewhere (Meggitt 1965; Bates 1985; Latz 
1995b; Gott 2005; Bird et al. 2013; Cahir & McMaster 
2018; Sutton & Walshe 2021). Most early ethnographers 
and later anthropologists were focused more upon social 
organization and rituals, rather than the Traditional 
Owner economy and ecology (see Rose et al. 2003; for 
exceptions see Bates 1985 and Rose 1987). Occasionally, 
more accurate assessments of the ecological agency of 
the Traditional Owners have been published (e.g. Tindale 
1959; Sutton & Walshe 2021).
Grasslands and TO-LM in the Mallee and Wimmera
Between the period of light pastoral use (late 1840s) and 
the commencement of agricultural settlement from the 
late 1880s to the 1920s, large parts of the Victorian Mallee 
were extensively surveyed for land subdivision. One of us 
(JB) examined all this early cartographic material for any 
evidence of Traditional Owner land use that was present 
at that time and recorded by surveyors (Burch et al. 2020; 
Burch in prep.).
Early observations of fauna and current ecology 
Early and recent scientific literature on the fauna of the 
region and Australia-wide was examined and habitat 
and range descriptions extracted (e.g. Gould 1863; Kreft 
1865a,b; Troughton 1973; Ride 1970; Watts & Aslin 1981; 
Dickman 1994; Menkhorst 1995; Bennett et al. 1989 & 
2006 and various authors in Strahan 1998a). In the region, 
Krefft (1865a) was the only early fauna survey (1856‒7, 
based heavily on Traditional Owner knowledge, although 
Mitchell (1838), Sturt (1833) and others made many 
important observations.
Interpretation of data 
Current remnant populations are very unlikely to reflect the 
optimal habitat for any species. Indeed, present occurrence 
may represent persistence in depauperate environments 
(see Tree 2019). We examined modern ecological research, 
accepting that it derived from degraded palettes for the 
regionally extinct species (but extant elsewhere) and 
their relatives. Of particular interest was the increasing 
understanding of the eco-engineering functions of 
mammals (Davies et al. 2019) and diets, particularly 
mycophagy (Vernes & Trappe 2007). Evidence (below) 
indicates that these spectra were more fully understood 
within Traditional Owner knowledge and management 
than present emerging science (e.g. Bird et al. 2013; Sutton 
& Walshe 2021).
Species with known records in the area but considered 
marginal have been excluded, e.g. the mesic Bindjulang 
(Dasyurus maculatus) and Yellow-footed Antechinus 
(Antechinus flavipes). It is likely that some additional arid-
zone species may have occurred in the region but at the

Tolerable fire intervals are the time (years) between two successive fire events (of differing intensities) at a site in order that a 
vegetation community and its constituent species can persist (see Cheal 2010).
1. Maximum time interval — if exceeded, the vegetation community becomes senescent and changes to a different vegetation 
community. These figures are necessarily predictive and conceptual as there are no data beyond a handful of decades. They are based 
on individual plant longevities, their ability to regenerate in the absence of fire or other disturbance, and field observations.
2. Minimum high severity — minimum time (years) required between two successive high-severity fire events at a site in order that 
a vegetation community or its constituent species can persist and have every reasonable chance of reaching maturity and producing 
propagules before the following fire event. High-severity fires usually burn complete stands of larger trees and their crowns leaving 
few and scattered unburnt patches within the fire perimeter. 
3. Minimum low severity — minimum time required between two successive fire events at a site, the first of which is a low-severity 
fire with a high proportion of unburnt landscape scattered within the fire perimeter, in order that a vegetation community or its 
constituent species can persist and have every reasonable chance of reaching maturity and setting seed. Low-severity fires usually 
burn shrubs and lower strata plants, and do not usually appreciably burn tree canopies. Low-severity fires are also significantly 
patchy, with many unburnt patches within the fire perimeter.

POPULATION COLLAPSES IN THE SEMI-ARID REGION OF THE MURRAY‒DARLING BASIN, SOUTHEASTERN AUSTRALIA
RESULTS
Grasslands, fire, ecotones and landscape effects
Schematic models of the life history of grasslands, 
particularly in relation to the grassy field layer and fire, 
are provided in Figures 2 and 3. Mesic tussock grasslands 
in southeastern Australia are dominated by the tall Poa / 
Rytidosperma spp. or Themeda spp. and a multi-trophic 
level productivity pulse begins in the adolescent stage and 
peaks within the mature stage 3–5 years post fire (Figure 
2). This post-fire pulse supports the most vigorous growth 
of tuberous and rhizomatous species and forbs as it also 
does in Mallee-Triodia vegetation (Zimmer 1940; Parsons 
1981) (Figure 2, Table 2). The forbs (not grasses) in 
grassland of the self-mulching soils of the lower Murray‒
Darling basin are the major food source of the once super-
abundant Bogong Moth (Agrotis infusa) (Green et al. 
2021). Post-pulse, the grassland matures to senescence 
and the forbs are largely eliminated (Figure 2; Morgan & 
Lunt 1999). Some grain-producing annuals (e.g. Panicum 
spp.) and some wetland species also have a post-fire pulse. 
In Mallee-Triodia, visible plant species counts went from 
18 to 63 following a 4 ha fire and produced a pulse of 
grasses, perennial tuberous and rhizomatous species from 
seed (persistent in the soil seed bank) and tubers (Parsons 
1981; Zimmer 1940). In the more arid zones, grasslands 
are often dominated by Spinifex (Triodia spp.) and here the 
productivity pulse occurs 1–8 years post-fire, dependent on 
rain (Zimmer 1940; Cheal 2010) (Table 1). Tuber-forming 
plants, occurring in the productive pulse of various grass 
field layers, are listed in Table 2.
The seed-bed and plant response after a cool fire are 
qualitatively different from post-grazing. Soil moisture 
is increased (plant foliage mass is decreased), while the 
pH and many soil nutrients are elevated (e.g. Chungu et 
al. 2020). Hodges (2021) and Hodges et al. (2021) found 
that of 55 species of temperate grasslands, 45 (82%) had 
improved germination following smoke, heat or both 
treatments. Furthermore, in temperate grasslands, low 
intensity fires transfer relatively little heat energy to the 
substrate, which preserves the composition and resilience 
of the heat-sensitive, subterranean fungal community 
and floral diversity. Both of these change (decline) if fire 
frequency exceeds once every three years, perhaps as 
symbiotic relationships are severed, e.g. mycorrhizal fungi 
and tuberous forbs (Christensen 1998; Edgidi et al. 2016; 
Figure 3: Idealized relative abundance of mammalian food resources across trophic levels in grassy field layer in response to fire. 
Note ectomycorrhizal fungi curve reliant on vicinity of trees and shrubs; e.g. grassy woodland (see Figure 4). Adapted from Morgan 
and Lunt (1999) and other biological data (see text).

Fisher et al. 2016). Prescribed burning is not equivalent to 
TO burning and may have deleterious on biotic balance 
(e.g. fungi, Trappe et al. 2006). There is a direct link 
between frequent, low intensity burning in grasslands 
(=patch burning) and multi-trophic layer species diversity, 
resilience and productivity. We contend that the distribution 
and abundance of vertebrates, particularly mammals, 
positively responded to this suite of attributes and their 
determination by fire management.
In the presence of partner trees and shrubs (e.g. 
Eucalyptus, Allocasuarina, Melaleuca), a suite of 
pyrophilous (fire-loving) fungal species produce fruit-
bodies on recently burnt sites, typically in the first and 
second years after fire, often in large numbers (Warcup 
1990; Robinson et al. 2008; Claridge et al. 2009; 
McMullan-Fisher et al. 2011; T. May pers. comm.) (Figure 
3). The majority of pyrophilous macro-fungi produce fruit-
bodies in the first autumn following a spring or summer 
fire including agaricoid fungi and mycorrhizal species 
(Warcup 1990; Robinson et al. 2008; McMullan-Fisher 
et al. 2011). Such fungi support a range of invertebrates 
and are favoured by mycophagous mammals (Claridge 
2009; McMullan-Fisher et al. 2011) (Table 3, Figures 4 
& 5). The importance of fungi in mammalian diets (e.g. 
volume, seasonality) is becoming increasingly recognized, 
as is the role of these mammals as dispersal agents and

consequent vegetation health (Claridge 2002). Fourteen 
(60%) of the extinct species had fungi in their diets (Table 
3). Vernes (2014) found 38 species of fungi in Long-
nosed Bandicoot (Peremeles nasuta) scats, most common 
in autumn to winter, confirming the seasonality found in 
other mammalian studies (e.g. Cheal 1987). Mycophagous 
mammals preferentially graze on burnt ground with 
frequent movement between burnt and unburnt habitats 
(Vernes & Trappe 2007) and exclusion plots have shown 
lower seedling colonization and an altered community 
composition without these mammals (Gehring et al. 2002). 
Frequent fires (c. three- to five-year intervals) reduce 
the abundance of wood-consuming fungi (due to lack of 
food), suggesting that a lack of frequent fire would affect 
fungal grassland communities and probably invertebrates 
(e.g. York & Lewis 2017). This aspect of the productive 
pulse requires a grassy field layer and partner vegetation 
(e.g. grassy woodlands, mallee, open forest) and probably 
dissipates over large areas of pure grasslands (Figures 4 
& 5). The effect of grazing, browsing and predation on 
burnt areas by the suite of mycophagous, insectivorous, 
herbivorous and omnivorous mammals (Table 3) was 
likely significant on the subsequent floristic communities 
(e.g. Claridge 2002). Over the millennia, these complex, 
multi-trophic level interactions would have supported a 
more stable (and predictable) biota.
Post-fire vegetation and hypogeal fungi define optimal 
habitat for the Smoky Mouse (Pseudomys fumeus), a 
species of mesic habitats, where females have heightened 
breeding success, site fidelity and population stability, in 
marked contrast with fluctuating, transient populations in 
sub-optimal habitat (Cockburn 1981; Ford et al. 2003). A 
similar fire‒fungi‒density relationship has been recorded 
for three species of bettong, including the Woylie (Bettongia 
penicillata) (Christensen 1998). A meta-analysis (148 
studies) of small mammals found elevated food resources 
(supplemented) increased reproductive rates, significantly 
increased population densities by 150%, which became 
even greater when predation was reduced and populations 
were open to immigration (Prevedello et al. 2013). Thus, 
the predictable food resources of the grassland productive 
pulse would have produced elevated population levels 
that supported a meta-population in the broader landscape 
(Figures 5, 6, 7 & 8).
A regime of burning grassland every three to five years 
maintains the grassy field layer in a stage which optimizes 
the biological productivity pulse for both human food and 
a suite of mycophagous, insectivorous and herbivorous 
mammals (Gott 2005 & 2008) (Tables 2 & 3). This 
period may be extended in arid grasslands (Table 2). It 
also removes the fire risk of mature senescent swards. 
Significantly, this pulse provided vital autumn and winter 
food during this resource-limited season (see Table 3). 
Some of these species (e.g. bilby, potoroids, peramelids) 
are now recognized as ecosystem engineers, individuals 
moving tonnes of soil per annum (Davies et al. 2019). 
Elevated population levels of mycophagous and digging 
mammals would have initiated soil disturbance, spread 
fungal spores through adjacent environments, enhanced

water retention and ecosystem health and also provided sites 
for plant species establishment (including by disrupting 
the cryptogamic soil crust). Individual potoroids may 
turn over more than 9 tonnes/ha/yr (Prendergast (2015). 
Some fungi also reduce plant drought stress (Claridge 
2002; Tommerup & Bougher 2000; McMullan-Fisher et 
al. 2011). Regular mosaic grassland burning regenerated 
nutrients back into sites and the associated eco-engineering 
mammals optimized in situ soil moisture, producing a 
highly productive self-reinforcing energetically-closed 
system. Multi-trophic level mammal food for Traditional 
Owners was more abundant and predictable in time and 
space (Table 2). Conversely, disruption and elimination of 
such a management regime would see a rapid decline in 
habitat quality and consequent mammal populations. In 
the complete absence of such a fire regime, mammalian 
populations dependent on this productivity pulse would 
decline well within a decade (Table 1, Figures 2 & 3).

of the fire ground is 50% of a 5 ha fire, 8% of a 50 ha 
fire, and minimal at 1000 ha, the percentage doubling at 
50 m. Smaller patch fires and elongated areas produce 
relatively large areas of ecotone. The vegetated area of 
the ecotone provides protective cover (from predation and 
heat stress; denning sites) for mammals directly adjacent 
to the productive pulse. Mala (Lagorchestes hirsutus) have 
been recorded travelling 150 m to feed on burnt areas 
(Bolton & Latz 1978; Vernes & Trappe 2007) and the 
Eastern Bettong (Bettongia gaimardi), may travel 1.5 km 
between nest and feeding area. Thus a feeding catchment, 
supporting elevated population levels around a grassland 
productive pulse, may extend for tens of km2 (Figures 
5, 6 & 7). Within the burnt grasslands, protective cover 
for small to medium-sized mammals is achieved around 
2‒6 years after fire and thereafter access and biological 
diversity and richness decline as vegetation thickens into 
senescence (Figure 2). Within a decade after fire, the 
abundance of palatable human and mammal food and 
surrounding ecotones disappears and becomes vulnerable 
to invasion by shrubs, e.g. Acacia spp. and/or trees, e.g. 
Eucalyptus, Allocasuarina, Callitris and Myoporum spp. 
(Figures 3 and 4).

POPULATION COLLAPSES IN THE SEMI-ARID REGION OF THE MURRAY‒DARLING BASIN, SOUTHEASTERN AUSTRALIA
Tolerable Fire Intervals (to maintain a vegetation 
community) and recovery times under different fire 
intensities and frequencies are short in grasslands (Cheal 
2010) (Table 1). Grassy field layers (under several shrub 
and canopy types) can be maintained (or created) by a 
burning regime of a low intensity fire every three to five 
years, e.g. Grassy Woodland of north-western Victoria 
(Cheal 2010; Table 2). The relative lack of litter (burnable 
material) under shrubs and around tree-trunks means 
that a low intensity fire can maintain the grassy field 
layer (Cheal 2010) while only minimally impacting on 
the canopy trees. Fire kills young (emergent) shrubs and 
trees, conserving the advantage of grassland species and 
assisting in situ regeneration. The extensive, fire-sensitive 
chenopod shrublands (alluvial black soil plains / alkaline 
soils) can survive low intensity fires (at longer intervals) 
which would protect them from high intensity fires (Table 
1). Fire resistant cryptogamic crusts in grasslands help 
conserve moisture, inhibit invasion of exotic plants and 
thus tend to conserve grassland in situ (Morgan 2006 & 
2015). A slightly more intense fire kills the shrub layer and 
extends the grassland (Cheal 2010; Stefferson 2020). Grass 
species are adapted to relatively frequent fire. Almost half 
the grasses of western NSW significantly increase their 
germination in presence of smoke (Native Millet Panicum 
decompositum from 7.7 to 63.1%, P. effusum from 0 to 
16.7%) while germination of less-productive invasive 
natives, e.g. C3 Austrostipa scabra is reduced (30.2 to 
19.9%) (Read & Bellairs 1999).
Edward Curr (1883) estimated that the whole country 
was burnt every five years and saw the results of TO-LM 
— tussocks on Victoria’s northern plains grew 0.6‒6m 
apart. The TO-LM fire regime supported the extent of the 
taller, perennial tussock grasses (C3 species Austrostipa 
bigeniculata, A. aristiglumis, Poa labillardierei and 
others; the C4 species — Themeda triandra, T. avenacea, 
Homopholis proluta, Eragrostis spp. and others) and 
annuals such as Native Millet (Cahir & McMaster 2018; 
McIvor 2005; Morgan & Lunt 1999). The tetraploid, semi-
arid variant of T. triandra, now highly restricted, was 
probably more widespread, affecting the productivity and 
flammability of the semi-arid grassland (see Box 2, Morgan

pers. comm. June 2021). The absence of TO-LM would 
see the decline of the warm-season (C4) species (e.g. T. 
triandra) and, with grazing and associated changed fire 
regimes the invasion of these grasslands and shrublands by 
less productive winter-season species would be accelerated 
(e.g. Austrostipa spp.) (McIvor 2005; Allen 1983 and 
references therein).
At the meso- and macro-scale, patch burning across fire 
prone environments has other impacts in the reduction of 
large bushfires, enhancement of habitat heterogeneity and 
the extent of mature long-unburnt vegetation (Bird et al. 
2013; Trauernicht et al. 2015). Over the millennia, all of 
these attributes enhanced mammal abundance, diversity 
and persistence. The absence of patch burning elicits 
changes well within decades. In 1953, when many Martu 
left their arid country in WA, the mean size of fires was 62 
ha. Upon their return in 1981 the mean size of fires was 
52 000 ha. The extent of all types of mature vegetation had 
dramatically declined and the Boodie (Bettongia lesueur) 
had become extinct over this 30-year period (Bird et al. 
2013). Perhaps coincidently, the first major bushfire in our 
region burnt through the Wimmera (and much of Victoria) 
on 6 February 1851 (Clarke et al. 2021). Traditional Owner 
fires are embedded in many Australian ecosystems but 
fire regimes have dramatically changed since European 
colonization (Tindale 1959; Latz 1995b; Gott 2005 & 
2008; Cahir & McMaster 2018) (Figure 3).
Traditional Owner use of fire 
Context
Tindale (1959) was one of the earlier anthropologists to see 
the scale of Traditional Owners as ecological agents using 
fire: ‘Thus man probably has had a significant hand in the 
moulding of the present configuration of parts of Australia. 
Indeed, much of the grasslands of Australia could have been 
brought into being as a result of his exploitation.’ Since 
then, our understanding of the sophistication of Traditional 
Owner use of fire in land management has dramatically 
increased (Gott 2005 & 2008; Cahir & McMaster 2018; 
Cahir et al. 2016; Sutton & Walshe 2021). Traditional 
Owners used fire for a wide range of reasons, including 
hunting, food gathering, clearing travel ways, vermin 
control, signalling and cooking. Wik elders maintained that 
the main purpose for firing patches of country was to make 
the country ‘open and safe for travelling on foot … open 
enough to see long distances beyond camps. People also 
knew that firing incidentally led to green pick that drew 
marsupials to recently burned areas, but this was not its 
main purpose’ (Sutton & Walshe 2021). In the arid zone 
Latz and Griffin (1978) concluded: ‘Burning appears to 
have been almost habitual and the effect so self-evident that 
the two events, burning followed by food increase, were 
seen to be almost synonymous providing religious duties 
were maintained’ (see also Peasley 2009). TO-LM and fire 
were mediated through their dreaming (ceremonies, totems, 
rites etc.), embedded in which was a deep understanding of 
ecology that sought to sustain the status quo (Elkin 1933; 
Newsome 1980; Bates 1985; Davenport et al. 2005a,b; 
Bird et al. 2013; Sutton & Walshe 2021). Knowledge 
directly from elders showed that grassy field layers and 
their substrates were important determinants in traditional 
burning techniques that helped determine ‘fire country and 
non-fire country’ (Skroblin et al. 2017; Stefferson 2020). In 
the arid and semi-arid zone, the good rain-grass-fuel load 
would have determined the ‘when’ and ‘where’ of fires, so 
as to avoid risk of later larger conflagrations (e.g. Bradstock 
et al. 2002). TO-LM produced fine-grained mosaics and 
created locally predictable food resources i.e. preferred

flora and fauna habitat (Burbidge 1985, Latz 1995a; Gott 
2005 & 2008; Gammage 2012; Bliege Bird et al. 2008.
The mid Murray‒Darling
Prior to European settlement, the riverine–grassland 
economy along the Murray River supported among the 
highest densities of Traditional Owner populations on the 
continent. These had increased, intensified resource use 
and become more complex over the previous 2000 years 
(Allen 1972; Williams et al. 2015; Burch 2017; Sutton & 
Walshe 2021). Most European explorers commented on 
the frequency of the Traditional Owners’ use of fire (Cahir 
et al. 2016). Along the Darling River in 1835 Mitchell 
(1838) observed: ‘the new grass springing up in places 
where it had been burnt presented a shining verdure’ (11 
April, 1835) and ‘the thick scrub having been previously 
burnt’ [June 5] and on 19 June observed Traditional Owner 
haystacks of Panicum (Native Millet) …. ‘extended for 
miles’ growing almost as a monoculture but interspersed 
with ‘smaller heaps’ of Yam-daisies (Microseris). Such 
environments require fire and are natal areas of Bogong 
Moths (Green et al. 2021; Box 2). In 1836, Mitchell 
observed of Dja Dja Wurrung country: ‘On highest 
mountains and in places the most remote and desolate, I 
have always found every dead trunk on the ground and any 
living tree of any magnitude also, the marks of fire; and 
thus it appeared that these annual conflagrations extend 
to every place’ (Mitchell 1838; Golding 2018). Hawdon 
(1952) noted on the riverine corridor of the Murray (20 
February 1838): ‘The stock had scarcely anything to eat, 
the Natives having set fire to everything in the shape of 
food …’. Whether this observation was TO-LM, or at that 
time, an intentional act of resistance to invasion we do not 
know; however, apart from Beilby (1849) this is among 
the last records of extensive burning that we found in the 
region (apart from recent times).
Cahir and McMaster (2018) examined the early 
Europeans’ observations of Traditional Owner use of fire in 
Victoria, concluding that burning practices were managed, 
frequent and generally over small areas of grassland plain. 
Some of their observations are pertinent to our narrative, 
recognising, as they did, that these are a subset of a much 
depleted TO-LM system. The Traditional Owners in 
central Victoria were ‘In the habit of burning off the old 
grass so as to have good fresh grass for their kangaroos, 
wallabies, emus, turkeys and other smaller granivores 
birds’ (Lang 1847) and they were ‘careful to see that no 
harm was done to the vegetables that yielded food’ (Smyth 
1878) and ‘aboriginal fires were common and docile 
during the summer’ (Murray 1843). Observers noted that 
fires were also commonly used around water courses (e.g. 
Curr 1883). John Webster (quoted in Cahir et al. 2018), 
an overlander, would observe near the border of Victoria 
and South Australia (Meru country) (Dec. 1840, p. 123) 
‘the firing of the grass had been quite recent’ and, along 
the grassy river flats of the Murrumbidgee and the Murray 
(Dec. 1840, p. 123) ‘all the trees here … bear the evidence 
of frequent fires … caused by many years of conflagrations 
of grass’ and a fortnight later witnessed TO firing in which 
‘the dry portions of the grass only were consumed’. Also,

almost solely restricted to these grassland patches and the thickened root provided TO and mammal food (Gott 2008). Note: Sharp 
boundary between grassland and surrounding mallee with no topographic or obvious soil changes; and the absence of stumps and

along the Murray River near Swan Hill, James Kirby, a 
drover, observed (1840) ‘in the distance where the blacks 
had not burnt reeds, it looked like large fields of ripe wheat; 
and near where they had burnt them, it had the appearance 
of a splendid crop just before it comes to ear’. Reed beds 
were patch burnt for food, habitat and spear shafts (Curr 
1883). In July 1841, winter burning of Yam Daisies, which 
increased yields, (Microseris) was observed by Robinson 
(Gott 2005 & 2008; Cahir & McMaster 2018).
Traditional Owners of the region had substantial 
sedentary 
camps/congregation 
places; 
each 
group 
conducted seasonal movements (always carrying a fire 
stick) to ‘care for their country’ across the landscape 
(Dawson 2009; Gott 2005; Gammage 2012; Burch 
2017 & 2018; Cahir et al. 2018; Stefferson 2020). Patch 
burning of grasslands (including wetland verges) kept 
them at their most productive for food resources (Gott 
2005; Gott et al. 2015; Cahir & McMaster 2018) (Figure 
3, Table 2). Furthermore, Bird et al. (2008) found that 
for foragers, particularly of small game, the fire-induced 
habitat heterogeneity was important as it directly affected 
catch per unit effort (see Figure 8) and prevented habitat 
loss. Seasonal movements would also allow management 
of special sites (refugia) required for persistence across 
drought, flood and climatic variations. Early Europeans 
frequently described the artefacts of Traditional Owner 
management, grasslands and grassy woodlands of park-
like appearance despite being within a very fire-prone 
environment. Areas of extensive bushfires were not 
observed. It would be several decades after 1830 that large 
bushfires would become an environmental feature in the 
study area.
Grasslands and TO-LM in the Victorian Mallee 
Brough Smyth (Smyth 1878) considered the Mallee 
an ‘impenetrable thicket’. However, it supported more 
grasslands than this assessment indicates. The extent of 
Traditional Owners’ occupation and use of the Victorian 
Mallee has been contentious. Recent research, some of 
which related to use of grasslands, is suggestive of TO-
LM (White et al. 2003; Burch in prep., Beilby 1849). In 
early cartographic material, there are frequent references 
to grassy plains (Burch et al. 2020; Burch in prep.). The 
light pastoral use of parts of the Victorian Mallee between 
the late 1840s and the start of agricultural settlement from 
the late 1880s through to the 1920s has meant that evidence 
of earlier Traditional Owner land use has survived in 
maps and records made for land subdivision (Burch et al. 
2020). Furthermore, Aboriginal grinding stones have been 
found across ‘the mallee’ (Ross 1984) suggesting long-
term Traditional Owner presence. We contend that such 
management benefited the mammal fauna. Once ceased, 
mammals disappeared even with no or minimal grazing.
References to ‘park-like landscapes,’ so frequent in the 
grasslands and grassy woodlands, were very infrequent 
in the Mallee. In 1865 a private surveyor, Edmund 
Bage, recorded the presence of a large waterless plain 
[Woornoonoomal], over 2000 acres (~800 ha), southwest 
of Ouyen (Bage 1865) (Figure 6). Furthermore, extensive 
areas around saline discharge boinkas were probably 
naturally grassy, but have converged towards chenopod 
shrublands due to past grazing pressures from stock 
(Sluiter pers. comm. 2021). The presence of this rich 
grassland (Woornoonoomal) was confirmed by Nathaniel 
McKay in 1891 with mapping suggesting the presence of 
smaller plains alongside (Burch 2018). We contend that 
such waterless plains are artefacts of TO-LM, but were 
probably not maintained for the free-water-dependent 
large macropods, rather the mammalian Traditional Owner 
food resources in Table 3. Woylies (Bettongia penicillata) 
were recorded from the southern Murray mallee 
(Menkhorst & Beardsell 1982). Represented in Murray 
River archaeological sites, Bettongia penicillata were a 
consistent feature of Aboriginal hunting over the past 6000 
years, but have not been recorded on the Murray Plains 
since shortly after European settlement (Fusco et al. 2015). 
These species can persist, without drinking free water and 
can occupy habitats such as at Woornoonoomal (Strahan 
1998a) (Table 3). By 1891, after a good season and with 
abandoned pastoral wells providing new water sources, 
Woornoonoomal was hosting large numbers of the larger 
macropods. The most significant ‘park-like landscape’ 
is the Walpeup ‘parklands’ west of Ouyen, mapped by 
Edward Riggs White (White 1852). Walpeup appears to be 
a derivation from the Wergaia word ‘Walpa’ meaning fire 
(Ryan 2022: 297). In 1908 a party assessing the possibility 
of a railway west from Ouyen described the Walpeup Plain 
(remnant woodland): ‘Its richness and the beauty of the 
vegetation were a surprise. I have seen nothing in Northern 
Victoria to equal the latter. For miles in all directions belts 
and clumps of pine, myall, belar, bulloak and apple bush 
were growing in rich luxuriance. It was like a great park on 
which infinite skill had been expended to produce striking 
landscape effects’ (The Argus Tuesday 28 January 1908, 
p. 5). These are now very open Buloke Woodlands from 
Walpeup north to Pink Lakes, scattered grassland remnants 
of which persist throughout the Central Sunset country.
The first settlers of Ouyen found a similar, if smaller, 
‘park’ just to the west of the Ouyen Plain, suggestive of 
mature trees over a grassy field layer long managed by fire: 
‘there is a magnificent beauty spot, known locally as the 
“Fairy Dell”. It is a gorge situated between two pine ridges. 
Here there is a natural plantation of stately pines that give 
the “Dell” quite a parklike appearance’ (Weekly Times 21 
November 1908 p. 44).

POPULATION COLLAPSES IN THE SEMI-ARID REGION OF THE MURRAY‒DARLING BASIN, SOUTHEASTERN AUSTRALIA
Large plains and parks are infrequent in the Mallee 
back country, but references to small grassy plains occur 
frequently in surveyors’ reports in the Victorian Public 
Records Office. In the Wimmera 23 report and map, it is 
noted that east of Walpeup ‘Clumps of pines and occasional 
grass flats’ occurred, the latter mapped in the southeast 
corner of the map (White 1852) (Figure 7).
Examination of pre-agricultural maps reveals evidence 
of further small grassy plains suggestive of human 
involvement in their maintenance (Burch et al. 2020; 
Burch in prep.). Given the rapid and recent (perhaps 
c.1000 y BP) expansion of the mallee (Luly 1990) these 
grassy plains, often associated with Traditional Owner 
wells (Sandell 2011), are suggestive of TO-LM that sought 
to keep the landscape habitable through patch burning 
of grasslands. Burning the larger grassland plains and 
‘parks’ in combination with smaller grassy areas would 
have provided networks of productive pulses of habitat 
heterogeneity and predictable food across the landscape. 
We suggest that such management would have promoted 
persistence of meta-populations of some of the extinct 
Mallee mammals in Table 3. The early cartographers were 
searching for pasture that perhaps had not burnt for over two 
decades, but remained significant enough in the landscape 
of the 1850–60s to be mapped. Many of those that did not 
go directly under the plough (1880s and onwards) appear 
to have been quickly subsumed by either encroaching 
mallee eucalypts or trashed, as they surrounded Traditional 
Owner wells that were converted to ‘tanks’ (White et al. 
2003; Sandell 2011). Most were not identifiable in later 
vegetation surveys; however, a few survived to the present 
(Figure 9).
In remote areas of the Mallee, active, albeit probably 
much depleted, TO-LM continued or resumed, probably 
into the 1850s, and mammal populations survived. During 
a short but extensive trip through the Big Desert and Sunset 
Country, Beilby (1849) observed distant Traditional Owner 
burning and, on 6 and 8 October, grassy oases and grassy 
knolls with Traditional Owner wells: ‘a sandy desert which 
had been covered with heath, but was lately burnt’ and 
‘crossed a long grassy plain fringed with lofty pine and she-
oak, with clumps of high mallay studding it here and there. 
This plain contained about 600 acres and was well grassed’ 
and ‘a tract of mallay which had been burnt two or three 
years ago’ and ‘the little vegetation they (sandhills) support 
having been recently burnt’ and ‘we struck upon a patch of 
very luxuriant grass and herbs, situate between two scrubby 
hills, and fenced in like a paddock by a fringe of dense high 
mallay’. He concluded that the Traditional Owners ‘resort 
here in considerable numbers during the seasons … There 
were many old miamias on the ridge around the well, and 
incredible quantities of the bones of small animals or birds, 
and egg shells’. Travelling through same country, Morton 
(1861 in Bennett et al. 1989) observed many ‘kangaroo 
rats’ (likely Woylies), wallaby (?Bridled Nailtail) and 
pademelons (Eastern Hare-wallaby) — the last two being 
particularly abundant near grassy clearings or open mallee.
Early 
European 
contact 
and 
Traditional 
Owner 
depopulation 
In 1829, Charles Sturt, the first European to explore 
the lower Murray‒Darling region, entered a region of 
relatively high population density of Indigenous people and 
a managed productive grasslands environment (Williams 
et al. 2015; Burch 2017; Sutton & Walshe 2021). In early 
1830, approaching the confluence with the Darling River, 
Sturt was confronted by 600 Aboriginal warriors arrayed 
for battle. Conflict was avoided and such mass Indigenous 
military strength was never recorded again; however, other 
forms of resistance continued (Christie 1979; Elder 1998; 
Burch 2017).
Sturt’s parties in 1829 and 1830 were probably the 
only colonial settlers to have an opportunity to observe 
the Aboriginal communities of the Murray‒Darling and 
their land management before they were devastated by the 
impacts of settlement. The first impact was the introduction 
of smallpox. Smallpox may have reached the region in the 
early 1800s, but an epidemic was observed by Sturt along 
the Darling River in 1829, killing Traditional Owners in 
‘great numbers’. The oral history of Aboriginal people 
remembered the progress of smallpox along the Murray 
River in 1830 and its devastation of the semi-sedentary 
communities of the riverine corridor. One report suggested 
that the community of Kulkyne was subsequently deserted 
for a period (Burch 2017). Such destruction is entirely 
consistent with the 80‒90+% loss of life in native American 
communities devastated by smallpox (Cronon 1983).
Mitchell explored the much-depleted Murray‒Darling 
in 1834 and 1836 but there was no rush to settle the area. 
For the next decade much of the Murray–Darling was 
simply traversed by ‘overlanders’ droving sheep and 
cattle from Melbourne and Sydney to Adelaide. Pastoral 
settlement did not commence in many areas until the late 
1840s. The invasion of squatters is well documented for 
Victoria (e.g. Curr 1883; Kenyon 1914–15; Ballinger 
2011; Burch 2017) and New South Wales (Jervis 1949 & 
1956; Bean 1956). It began in 1840 and by 1847, where 
water was available, sheep (still enclosed at night) and 
cattle grazed areas of grassland. However, large areas of 
drier country remained ungrazed in remote parts — the Big 
Desert, Sunset Country and northern Riverine plains — and 
TO-LM persisted in these areas (Beilby 1849; Allen 1983). 
Pastoral occupation was not continuous. On the Darling, 
Traditional Owner resistance led to the abandonment of 
some stations. Nevertheless, all riverside stations were

retaken by 1860, with some subsequently abandoned in the 
drought of the 1890s (Allen 1972; Christie 1979). In the 
Victorian Mallee much of the back country was abandoned 
after drought, and the invasion of rabbits, in the mid to late 
1870s, and remained unoccupied into the twentieth century 
(Burch 2017).
The devastation of Aboriginal communities continued 
during these ‘overlanding’ and pastoral periods. Sturt 
managed contact with Aboriginal communities well, 
but others did not, and massacres occurred. Mitchell’s 
party committed a massacre at Mt Dispersion in 1836 
and another occurred at Rufus River in 1841. Lyndall 
Ryan (2022) has led a project mapping massacres across 
Australia and this documents other massacres along the 
Murray. Two massacres associated with the overlanding 
period occurred near the junction of the Murray and the 
Darling, and two others, one at the junction of the Murray 
and the Murrumbidgee and the other at Beveridge Island, 
arose out of conflict with pastoral settlers. Undoubtedly 
other, undocumented, massacres occurred.
Pastoral settlement continued, if not accelerated, the 
decline in Traditional Owner populations. New diseases 
were introduced, leading to already depleted populations 
declining by 50% in the first five years of colonial 
settlement (Burch 2017). Smallpox recurred with a further 
outbreak in 1850 killing an estimated 30% of the surviving 
population of the Darling River Barkindji (Allen 1972; 
Mitchell 1835; Dowling 2021). Syphilis became endemic 
with infection rates among the Dja Dja Wurrung along the 
Loddon River going from 3% to 90% (Curr 1883; Christie 
1979; Cannon 1990; Elder 1998; Cahir & McMaster 2018; 
Dowling 2021). Upon arrival at Tongala near the Murray 
River in 1841, Curr (1883) observed a remnant Bangerang 
people, describing what we would now call population 
trauma, who suffered a further 60% loss of its tribe over 
the next decade.
Pastoral settlement targeted Traditional Owner-
managed grasslands, destroying Aboriginal communities’ 
food and economy. In 1840, north-central Victoria 
supported ‘millions of murnong [Microseris] all over the 
plain and sheep grazing could make it disappear within 2 
years’ (Curr 1883; G. Robinson in Clark 1998; Ballinger 
2011 (large macropods were not common in these areas 
at the time). Although large macropods selectively graze 
Murnong to the detriment of its local abundance (Sluiter 
pers. comm. 2021), introduced ungulates were the 
major cause of this mass decline. However, witnessing 
such degradation, Curr (1883), attributed the absence 
of Traditional Owner regenerative grassland fire to the 
productivity loss of the grasslands 
A much-depleted burning regime persisted (for food 
and caring for country, see observations above) but an 
inability to maintain landscape scale TO-LM in the face 
of such depopulation and disruption was inevitable. We 
contend landscape scale TO-LM became functionally 
extinct across the southern half of the study area soon 
after 1830 (Burch 2017; Cahir & McMaster 2018) and 
the grasslands’ productive pulse disappeared. In the drier 
northern Riverina, the delayed presence of squatters 
allowed a depleted form of TO-LM to continue until the 
1880s (Allen 1983).
Extinct and depleted species, their habitats and TO-LM
Over the Holocene, until the last few centuries, mammal 
species would have adjusted their distributions and 
abundances (periods of refugia and radiation) to adapt 
to changing availability of habitats across the region. 
Likewise, TO-LM would have adapted patch burning to 
ensure predictable food supply (including mammals) 
across the fluxes and variegated vegetation of their country. 
Empirical data indicate such landscape management 
can be accomplished even at very low densities of intact 
Traditional Owner populations (e.g. Bird et al. 2013). This 
meant more predictable habitat and food resources and a 
consequent reduction in extensive bushfires, all of which 
advantaged mammals and maintained population levels 
(Bird et al. 2013). Species would have responded to the 
post-fire productive pulse of grasslands, edaphic factors 
and inter-specific competition.
Over the generations, traditional owners would have 
acquired and utilized intimate knowledge of mammal 
populations and favoured habitats. This knowledge base 
would have evolved to include responses to climatic 
change, droughts, floods and fire (bush fires and patch 
burning). The productive pulse described here would have 
been easily observed for people travelling country and 
attending to a multi-trophic level diet. In an oral culture 
such knowledge would been woven into their dreaming 
(rites, totemic system, ceremonies etc.) (Sutton & Walshe 
2021). Newsome (1980) described the convergence of 
ecology and traditional beliefs of the Dreaming of the 
Arunta. Their sacred site for the totemic Red Kangaroo 
(Macropus rufus) was the drought refugium and its 
song-lines the dispersion paths post-drought. The Martu 
understood niche creation and predator–prey relationship 
(Bird et al. 2013). The Gunditjmara explained the demise 
of a favoured food (honey dew) was due to consumption 
by the over-abundance of the Common Brushtail Possum 
(Trichosurus vulpecula) caused by the eradication of the 
Dingo (Canis dingo) (Dawson 2009). Traditional Owner 
relocation of Brushtail Possums occurred in the Riverina, 
and although such observations are rare in the literature, 
they may well have been more common (Sutton & Walshe 
2021). There are numerous contemporaneous extinctions

SOMETHING WENT MISSING: CESSATION OF TRADITIONAL OWNER LAND MANAGEMENT AND RAPID MAMMALIAN

POPULATION COLLAPSES IN THE SEMI-ARID REGION OF THE MURRAY‒DARLING BASIN, SOUTHEASTERN AUSTRALIA
of semi-arid clans and their mammalian clan totems 
across the Nullarbor Plain (Boodie, Southern Hairy-nosed 
Wombat) suggestive of a profound interconnection (Bates 
1985). Howitt (1904) recorded totems of peoples in the 
region that included many of the mammals listed in Table 
3.
The Blandowski Expedition (1856‒57) was the first 
(and only for more than 100 years) detailed fauna survey 
of the region. Its zoologist, G. Krefft, collected the last 
record of 13 of the 27 mammal taxa (c. 40% of the total 
mammalian fauna) that would become extinct in the 
region. This became the invaluable baseline for numerous 
assessments of the mammalian collapse (Krefft 1865a; 
Bennett et al. 1989; Dickman 1993; Menkhorst 2009; 
Allen 2009 & 2010; Table 3). Comprehensive assessments 
of the mammal fauna have recorded rapid extinctions of 
the larger rodents, bandicoots and small macropodids (size 
range 0.15‒1.6 kg) (Bennett et al. 1989; Dickman 1993; 
Menkhorst 2009). Krefft (1865a) relied on Traditional 
Owner collectors who knew the when and where of the 
species’ habitats. We take his (most likely those of the 
Nyeri Nyeri) assessments of relative abundance at the time 
(common to rare) as we now understand these terms.
Similar to archaeological records, Krefft observed that 
by 1857 small and medium-sized (Critical Weight Range) 
mammals remained important in the daily diet: ‘Native 
cats (Dasyurus geoffroii), all species of rats and mice, and 
the smallest wallabies (Halmaturus) are also eaten, and 
some of them obtained almost every day’ (Allen 1972; 
Krefft 1865a).
These extinct mammal species are discussed in relation 
to their dependency on the post-fire productivity pulse of 
grasslands (Figures 2 & 3) and to TO-LM. The declining 
conservation status of these species (and relatives) across 
the continent over the next century is examined to test 
the veracity of this eco-historical postulation. The fate of 
large, more generalist grazers (Macropus spp.) provides 
the contrast. The initial critical factor that pushed the suite 
of mammals into the extinction vortex was not their CWR 
(size) per se but the disappearance of the productivity pulse 
that supported their niches and food availability. Depleted 
food, habitat fragmentation and decreased populations were 
then increasingly vulnerable to the spread and population 
increases of Red Foxes and feral cats.
Physiological aspects may have helped determine 
population collapse or survival and expansion. The Field 
Metabolic Rate (FMR) and water influx of arid-zone 
marsupials are 35% less than similar sized mesic species 
(eutherian mammal equivalent is 30% less), with smaller 
species having higher metabolic rates than larger macropod 
species (Withers 1992; Nagy & Bradshaw 1991 and 2000; 
Pavey et al. 2009; Riek & Bruggeman 2013). Higher 
metabolic rates and ability to extract water from food meant 
that the abundance and persistence of small to medium-sized 
species (Table 3) benefited from the productive pulse at the 
landscape scale of TO-LM. Furthermore, while some small 
to medium-sized heterothermic species (e.g. dasyurids, 
myrmecobiids) can utilize energy-saving torpor, this is 
not available to homeothermic species such as bandicoots, 
small macropods and, we predict, bettongs, which would 
increase their vulnerability to food depletion (Geiser & 
Kortner 2010; Geiser pers. comm. 2021). In addition, the 
soon extinct rodents were genetically robust at the time of 
European settlement, so genetic impoverishment is not an 
argument for their decline (Roycroft et al. 2021).
The species
Twenty-four species were recorded, four of which became 
extinct very quickly; the others have extant (mostly 
remnant and small) populations elsewhere in Australia 
(see below and Table 3). Whatever the macro-habitat, most 
species, through their diets (or nesting requirements), have 
a meso- or micro-habitat component that consists of, or 
is enhanced by, or otherwise includes, some form of fire-
managed grassland or grassy field layer, from Triodia to 
other grasses (Table 3) or other habitat consequent of TO-
LM. All species described below were Traditional Owner 
food sources.
Potoroids, Peramelids and Bilby
The potoroids, three species of bettongs, are larger than 
the bandicoots, more fungivorous and associated with 
grasslands and grassy field layers and fire (e.g. Johnson 
1997). They all declined rapidly (Strahan 1998a; Menkhorst 
2009). The Bettongia penicillata favours clumped low field 
layers of tussock grass, in places under a eucalypt canopy, 
and has a diet largely of hypogeal fungi supplemented by 
bulbs and tubers. Fire does not seem to induce stress in 
Woylies (Hing et al. 2017). In 1857, it remained common 
in thickets of lignum (Duma florulenta and D. horrida) 
along the Murray River, riverine Black Box and channel 
country in the southern Mallee and northern Wimmera 
(Kreft 1865a; Menkhorst 1995; Sluiter pers. comm. 2021). 
Many early observers noted the Boodie (B. lesueur) as the 
most abundant native animal across the semi-arid/arid zone 
but it had disappeared from Victoria by 1863 (Burbidge 
1998). Fungi are an important part of its diet, as are bulbs 
and tubers, and communal warrens are dug in the moister 
parts of the environment (Burbidge 1998; see also Winter 
& Johnson 1998). Clans across the Nullarbor took their 
names from food sources most important in their country; 
hence one clan was the Boodie people = Boodie country 
(Bates 1985).

The Rufous Bettong (Aepyprymnus rufescens) is a 
more mesic species and a southern, disjunct population 
was centred around the Murray River (Menkhorst 1995), 
where its habitat of mesic tussock grasslands Poa spp. 
was actively managed by Traditional Owner fires (see 
Webster’s observations op. cit.). The tubers (Eleocharis, 
Cycnogeton, Typha spp.) in reed beds (actively managed 
by Traditional Owners) may also have been an important 
part of its habitat (Curr 1883). It eats roots, tubers and 
fungi (where abundant), particularly in dry times when 
browse is sparse (Dennis & Johnson 1998). Once common 
east of Euston (Krefft 1865a), it rapidly disappeared from 
the plains. The last Victorian specimen was obtained from 
near Bendigo at the end of the nineteenth century (Table 3).
Peramelid populations typically move to exploit post-
fire habitats and are predominantly insectivorous, with 
bilbies more carnivorous. These species also exploit 
tubers, fruit and small animals and dig for dietary items, 
with the importance of their mycophagy increasingly 
recognized (Strahan 1998a; Seebeck et al. 1990; 
Tommerup & Bougher 2000; Claridge 2002). This region 
was the first to experience the collapse of the peramelid 
fauna that continued across the arid–semi-arid zone over 
the next century. Krefft (1865a) observed that the Western 
Barred Bandicoot (subspecies of Perameles bougainville) 
remained ‘common on all parts the Murray River in 1857’ 
but along with the Pig-footed Bandicoot (Chaeropus 
ecaudatus) rapidly entered a trajectory of continental 
decline (Krefft 1865a; Kemper 1990; Friend 1990; Johnson 
& Burbidge 1998). We interpret Krefft’s term ‘common’ to 
mean specimens being readily available to his Traditional 
Owner collectors. That said, grassy habitats over the fertile 
heavy clay soils in northwestern Victoria and the extensive 
Mallee‒Box community that had been maintained by TO 
burning were preferentially selected by early pastoralists. 
The Golden Bandicoot (Isoodon auratus) had a wide range 
across arid Australia in habitats associated with spinifex 
(arid) and other tussock woodland–grasslands, which 
had field layers burnt by Traditional Owners (Davenport 
et al. 2005a; Bird et al. 2013; Sutton & Walshe 2021). 
The peramelid species rapidly declined in this region 
and a century later (1930–50s) in the arid zone, broadly 
coinciding with decline in TO-LM (Ashby et al. 1990, 
Burbidge et al. 1988; Friend 1990; Menkhorst & Seebeck 
1990; Ellis et al. 1991; McKenzie et al.1998). The decline 
of what was recorded as Isoodon obesulus in the semi-arid 
zone has been attributed to the cessation of Traditional 
Owner patch burning (Braithwaite 1998). The biology 
and life history strategies of this species are relatively 
well studied within current mesic environments — a diet 
of fungi, invertebrates, seeds and subterranean vegetable 
matter and a habitat of post-fire dry heathland (Seebeck et 
al. 1990; Opie et al. 1990; Braithwaite 1998). This species 
is not included in Table 3.
In contrast with other bandicoots, the Pig-footed 
Bandicoot 
(Chaeropus 
ecaudatus) 
was 
the 
most 
herbivorous of the bandicoots feeding on coarse native 
millet (?Panicum decompositum) (Nyeri Nyeri knowledge 
to Krefft 1865a) but Central Australian Traditional Owners 
observed that it ate ants, termites and roots. Mitchell 
obtained the first specimen in 1834 from the grassy plains 
near the Murray‒Murrumbidgee confluence. But by 1857 
it had declined to be ‘exceeding rare’. The last record in 
NSW to the north of our study area was in 1845 (Atlas of 
Living Australia 2021). The lack of grassland burning and 
resultant productivity loss rapidly pushed this specialist 
herbivore into the extinction vortex. Pig-footed Bandicoots 
survived longer in the arid zone and in Traditional Owner 
memory with the progressive decline to extinction broadly 
coinciding with curtailment of TO-LM between 1920 
and1950 (Friend 1990; Kemper 1990).
The potoroids, peramelids and bilbies are now 
recognized as soil engineers, each individual moving 
tonnes of soil/ha/year (Claridge 2002; Davies et al. 2019; 
Prendergast 2015). The food available in the grassland 
productivity pulse increased populations of these species 
and reinforced their productivity and resilience. An early 
observer noted that Long-tailed Hopping-mice (Notomys 
longicaudatus) were ‘very partial to the mounds thrown 
up’ by the Boodie and Greater Bilby (Gould 1863; Dixon 
1998) (Table 3). Once patch burning ceased, adverse 
change (increased desiccation, lack of regeneration, 
collapse of predator–prey mosaic relationships) would 
have very rapidly cascaded through and across ecosystems.
Outside the region, TO-LM continued for decades 
and many mammals persisted in such regions (Table 3). 
In 1899–1900, when the Wangkangurru people walked 
off their country in the eastern Simpson Desert (SA), the 
Greater Bilby and Eastern Hare-wallaby (Table 3) were 
still common food resources (Hercus 1985). These then 
disappeared in less than two decades (Jones 1923). The 
Martu people of the WA desert had burnt mature Triodia 
grass hummocks in the cool-dry season to capture the 
Greater Bilby (Macrotis lagotis), Boodie and the Rufous 
Hare-wallaby. The latter two disappeared after many 
Traditional Owners walked off country in 1953 and 
were cleared out in 1964 (Davenport et al. 2005; Bird 
et al. 2013). The Greater Bilby’s broader diet allowed 
persistence through a 17-year gap in TO burning, and tight 
mosaic burning, based around vegetation and substrate, 
was used to avoid large fires and recover habitat (Skroblin 
et al. 2017) (Table 3).

POPULATION COLLAPSES IN THE SEMI-ARID REGION OF THE MURRAY‒DARLING BASIN, SOUTHEASTERN AUSTRALIA
Dasyurids
The post-fire productivity pulse of grasslands was likely 
to have provided increased food availability for the 
predominantly insectivorous dasyurids. The population of 
the arboreal Red-tailed Phascogale (Phascogale calura) 
in the region was disjunct from three populations further 
west in South Australia and Western Australia (Bradley 
1998). Krefft (1865a) found it was already rare near the 
Murray‒Darling junction and this past habitat has been 
attributed to mature Red Gum and Belah woodlands and 
largely restricted to woody vegetation with a mature 
canopy (Bradley 1998; Menkhorst 1995; Sluiter pers. 
comm. 2021). Its diet includes insects, small birds and 
mammals and it feeds extensively on the ground. Along the 
Murray River, mature River Red Gum forest is now largely 
devoid of shrubs and the lower vegetation strata support a 
richness of invertebrates (e.g. 450 species in two trees, Yen 
et al. 2002). Two once-widespread vegetation communities 
(both now threatened) are recognized in Victoria: 
Northwest Plains Buloke Grassy Woodland (relatively 
fertile soils seasonally waterlogged) and Shrubby Pine–
Buloke Woodland (sandy loams over finer-grained 
substrates). Persistence of both types requires the absence 
of high severity/intensity fires for many decades (Table 2). 
Such habitats (and phascogale food) can be maintained by 
low intensity, Traditional Owner patch burning, and the 
floristic diversity and productivity of remnant woodlands 
(as recorded in the 1980s) would likely be enhanced by 
patch burning where there is a grassy field layer.
The 
larger 
meso-predator 
dasyurids, 
Dasyurus 
viverrinus and D. geoffroii occurred a broad range of 
habitats feeding on larger invertebrates (and their larvae), 
reptiles, small birds and mammals (to rabbit-size). In free-
ranging, arid zone carnivorous marsupials, high energy 
diets rich in vertebrate species (e.g. mammals) reduces the 
use of torpor (Pavey et al. 2009). Flexible use of torpor 
permits them to survive even on a diet of invertebrates, 
although this poorer quality food may adversely affect 
distribution and abundance of dasyurid meso-predators 
(Geiser pers. comm. 2022).
We contend that both these species benefited from the 
grasslands productivity pulse in the region: D. viverrinus in 
the mesic south and D. geoffroii in the north. D. viverrinus 
is most associated with grasslands, grassy field layers and 
their ecotones (Godsell 1982) and populations occurred 
in the southern areas where it was a totem for multiple 
Traditional Owners (e.g. Yung Bulug – Dja Dja, Wurrung; 
Howitt 1904) but it disappeared from the region late in 
nineteenth century. Elsewhere, it was able to prey switch 
(to invertebrates in pastures, rabbits, poultry) becoming 
common in places before its collapse, presumably from 
an epidemic, in the early twentieth century, and ultimate 
extinction on the mainland in the mid-twentieth century 
(Peacock & Abbott 2013; Abbott 2013). Further north 
‘Native cats (Dasyurus geoffroyii), all species of rats and 
mice, and smaller wallabies (Halmaturus) are also eaten, 
some of them obtained almost every day’ suggesting it 
remained common in Nyeri Nyeri country (Krefft 1865b). 
D. geoffroii populations once covered three-quarters of the 
continent, but rapidly collapsed. The last specimen from 
NSW in 1841, SA in 1888 (?), Northern Territory in 1896, 
Queensland in 1907, and Victoria in 1857 (Krefft 1865a; 
Jones 1923; Serena & Soderquist 1998). The timing of 
the continental collapse precedes fox, rabbit, ungulate 
invasions or epidemics, but is consistent with the loss 
of the TO-LM maintained grassland productivity pulse. 
Extant D. geoffroii populations occur in low densities in 
southwestern WA (Serena & Soderquist 1998). Decades 
after continental collapse, small populations of both 
species survived in metropolitan areas with the presence 
of cats and foxes (D. geoffroii in Perth in the 1930s, D. 
viverrinus in Melbourne and Sydney in the 1950s) (Serena 
& Soderquist 1998; Menkhorst 1995).
Three, possibly four, species of small dasyurids 
declined but were able to adapt to changes in the region. 
The ecologies of the Kultarr (Antechinomys laniger) and 
the Southern Ningaui (Ningaui yvonneae), endangered 
and vulnerable in NSW respectively, are not well known 
and they may always have been rare in the region (Krefft 
1865a; Valente 1998; McKenzie & Dickman 1998). The 
Mulgara (Dasycercus cristicauda) is known from bone 
remains at a single site (Ellis 1992). However, their past 
and current habitats and declines suggest some association 
with TO-LM. Their smaller energetic requirements and 
broader amplitude of prey may have assisted their survival. 
The rare Common Dunnart (S. murina) reaches highest 
densities in grassy habitats burnt 2‒4 years previously and 
feeds on Mus musculus (House Mouse) on disturbed sites 
(Fox 1998; Morton 1998; Sluiter pers. comm. 2021).
Smaller macropods
In May 1857, Blandowski procured a specimen of the 
Wurrung or Crescent Nailtail-wallaby (Onychogalea 
lunata) west of the Darling River. The limited available 
data fit our pattern. The Wurrung ate grasses, was hunted 
by Traditional Owners and occupied grasslands often with 
open eucalypt canopies (Burbidge 1998). Its decline to 
extinction appears to follow the curtailment of TO-LM (L. 
Hercus pers. comm. 1988; Burbidge 1998). The Bridled 
Nailtail-wallaby (O. fraenata) was the most common small 
wallaby around the Murray‒Darling and was common 
elsewhere at the time of European settlement (Gould 1863; 
Krefft 1865a). Until the twentieth century, it remained 
common enough in some areas for it to be hunted for its

pelt, but rapidly declined thereafter (Gordon & Lawrie 
1980). Remnant populations occupy a fairly narrow niche 
characterized by a field layer of forbs and native grasses 
(Gould 1863; Ellis et al. 1992) highly suggestive of a 
grassland fire pulse and TO-LM burning (Figure 2). The 
only extant population occurs near Dingo (Qld), with 
invasive Buffel Grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) as a key threat 
(DAWE 1997). Despite substantial effort, resources and 
investigation of options, the restitution of TO-LM does not 
seem to have been considered to date (Kearney et al. 2012).
Gould (1863) reported the Eastern Hare-wallaby 
(Lagorchestes leporides) as ‘tolerably abundant’ on the 
plains of southern Australia in the 1840s and Krefft (1865a) 
found it ‘common’ on the plains around the Murray–
Darling junction in the 1850s. The last record in Victoria 
was from Mt Hope 1867 (Menkhorst 1995). The last record 
in NSW (1892) was from the Riverina near where TO-
LM continued to 1880 (Allen 1983). The Eastern Hare-
wallaby’s diet and the reasons for its rapid disappearance 
prior to European settlement remain unknown. However, 
its association with tussock grasslands implies reliance 
on TO-LM (Gould 1863; Jones 1923; Strahan 1998b). It 
was hunted by Traditional Owners using fire (and nets) 
in country between the Darling and Lachlan Rivers, 
where it was ‘as thick as rabbits’, similarly for the Mala 
(Lagorchestes hirsutus) (Berndt 1947; Allen 1983).
The Mala is the western equivalent of the Eastern Hare-
wallaby and has sub-fossil remains in Victoria. In Central 
Australia, Finlayson (1935a,b) observed sophisticated 
Mala hunting using fire (covering around 5 km2): ‘it might 
be thought that such a fire would wipe out every living 
thing in its path, but that this is by no means so, can be 
seen from inspection of the ground afterwards, when fresh 
mammal tracks are in plenty; it follows also from the fact 
that the whole business has been carried out systematically 
for untold generations and over enormous areas.’
In WA, the Mala was common food for the Martu in 
the 1950s. It preferred nutritious post-fire forbs and grasses 
with high water content (Johnson & Burbidge 1998; Bird 
et al. 2013). In Central Australia, the last two populations 
of Mala used >10 year-old Triodia for shelter and travelled 
150 m to feed on fire-recovery plants in burnt areas (Bolton 
& Latz 1978). If shelters were burnt there were movements 
of 0.5 km to older Triodia, a patch burning adaptation. 
Large bushfires adversely affected these populations and 
it is now being reintroduced to the Tanami Desert where 
a ‘tight mosaic of vegetation in various stages of recovery 
that provided structural and floristic diversity favourable to 
the species’ is being re-implemented within predator-proof 
fencing (Bolton & Latz 1978; Johnson & Burbidge 1998; 
Richards 2012a).
Rodents
Recent taxonomic revision found the Shark Bay Mouse 
(Pseudomys fieldi) to be conspecific with P. gouldii, so this 
species is not universally extinct (Roycroft et al. 2021) but 
is certainly so in our study region. This study found that all 
the Australia rodents that became extinct were genetically 
diverse and robust at the time of European settlement. 
Genetic impoverishment or other aspects of ‘lack of 
fitness’ of native species, sometimes used by proponents 
of the ‘additions’ argument, appear to have little or no 
explanatory value.
Compared with arid and mesic environments, the 
semi-arid zone supports low species richness of rodents. 
Nevertheless, our study area has the highest percentage of 
rodent species’ extinctions (Watts & Aslin 1981). In 1829, 
on their way to the lower Darling, Sturt’s party saw hundreds 
of Leporillus sp. nests, each estimated to contain 6–10 
rats (Allen 1972). Krefft (1865a) found that the Greater 
Stick-nest Rat (Leporillus conditor) fed on seeds, bulbous 
roots and insects and that it had disappeared south of the 
Murray River well before 1856 (Table 3) (Robinson 1998). 
The smaller, but more aggressive, Lesser Stick-nest Rat 
(Leporillus apicalis) had a broader diet, including smaller 
mammals and bird eggs and remained in ‘great numbers’ 
on both sides of the Murray River (Krefft 1865a). Modern 
assessments suggest both species of Leporillus favoured 
succulents, some common species of which benefit from 
fire, e.g. Carpobrotus modestus (Table 3) (Parsons 1997). 
Traditional Owners ate these stick-nest rats and TO 
patch burning would have benefited food availability and 
protected nests from bushfires (Allen 1972) (Figure 11, 
Tables 1 & 2). The tighter diet preferences of the Greater 
Stick-nest Rat suggest greater dependence on a productive 
pulse and thus its more rapid disappearance.
Most of the Pseudomys species, including four once 
common in the region (Table 3), are predominantly 
granivorous, but also eat herbage, insects and seasonal 
fungi. Pseudomys spp. also appear to exploit post-
fire pulses. Most arid–semi-arid species are associated 
with grasslands (tussock and spinifex hummock), using 
grass for communal nesting. P. desertor occurred in the 
region, disjunct from its continental range, and is the 
most herbivorous of the species feeding on rhizomes 
and succulent shoots, suggesting a post-fire association 
(Kerle 1998) (Table 3). Bolam’s Mouse (Pseudomys 
bolami), once common, remains but is rare in the region, 
with data too few to determine food preferences (Kelly 
et al. 2011). These rodents respond to wetter years but 
distributions within ranges appear sporadic (Watts & Aslin 
1981). Landscape decline of the fire- induced grassland 
pulse with its enhanced supply of autumn-winter food,

POPULATION COLLAPSES IN THE SEMI-ARID REGION OF THE MURRAY‒DARLING BASIN, SOUTHEASTERN AUSTRALIA
provides a feasible explanation for the drastic reductions 
of populations across this genus.
Notomys spp. have an association with grasses; 
however each species had distinct habitat, and direct 
association with the productive pulse is unclear (Table 3). 
Gilbert, Gould’s collector, found that the favourite haunt of 
the Long-tailed Hopping-mouse (Notomys longicaudatus) 
was a stiff clay soil, whereas N. mitchelli favoured sandy 
substrates. Traditional Owner patch burning appears to 
accommodate such subtleties, as Stefferson (2020) shows 
substrates may determine application (if any) of fire. The 
Fawn Hopping Mouse (N. cervinus) and Dusky Hopping 
Mouse (N. fucus) may have occurred in the region as their 
perceived ranges occur very close to the northwest of our 
study area (see Strahan 1998a). The Long-tailed Hopping 
Mouse appears to have become rapidly extinct in our study 
area. The last specimen was collected in the Northern 
Territory in 1901–2. The Long-tailed Hopping Mouse is 
twice the size of N. fuscus (30–50 g), yet Sturt observed 
Traditional Owners with a catch of 150 to 200 of the smaller 
species for eating (Watts 1998; Krefft 1865b). Mammals as 
small as 30 g were harvested and the Traditional Owners 
knew where and when to harvest. The Barkindji travelled 
great distances for these foods (Allen 1972; Krefft 1865b).
In the mallee vegetation in the Mallee region, Kelly 
et al. (2011) studied the response of three surviving small 
mammals and Mus musculus in relation to fire history (1–
105 years). These were not Traditional Owner burns and 
there were no native species directly associated with short 
fire intervals (all were extinct – Table 3). These results 
are consistent with our contention. The Mallee Ningaui 
(Ningaui yvonneae) favoured mature unburnt mallee. The 
Western Pygmy-possum (Cercartetus concinnus) and the 
Common Dunnart appeared to have habitat preferences 
with no strong association to time since fire. Fox (1998) 
found the Common Dunnart did have a post-fire association 
in his study area (not in our subject region). Each study 
area probably experienced fires with different, e.g. extent, 
intensity and seasonality. Predictably, the exotic House 
Mouse showed a preference for recently burnt habitat, as 
do at least some Pseudomys spp., which, where present, 
often displace the House Mouse as vegetation ages (Kelly 
et al. 2011; Fox and Pople 1994).

Box 1: Environmental change over deep time 
Basic vegetation types (and habitat) are expressions of soil, climate, available genetic plant and fungi material, fire and 
grazing regimes (fauna) over time. Whatever the combination of causes of the extinction of Australia’s herbivorous 
megafauna (climate, human, fire) around that time, the continent’s vegetation transitioned to become more fire-tolerant 
sclerophyllous. Grasses (Poaceae) and tuber-forming taxa (Asteraceae) have been a feature of the southern Victorian 
plains for over 30 000 years, with lower biological activity under cooler, drier conditions, and fauna contracted to refugia 
(Canning 2009). Mammal distributions and abundances also changed to reflect habitat availability — periods of refugia 
and radiation — which continued during massive changes in the climate, rainfall and vegetation of the Holocene (see 
text). TO-LM adapted patch burning to maintain and create more predictable food resources which reduced extensive 
bushfires, all of which advantaged mammals and maintained higher population levels (Bliege Bird et al. 2008; Bird et al. 
2013; see text). Empirical data indicate such landscape management can be accomplished even at very low densities of 
TO populations (Bird et al. 2013). 
By 7000 y BP, the Barkindji diet was 40% cereals — the lacustrine economy of Mungo Man (c. 42 000 y BP) had changed 
to riverine-grassland (Allen 1972). Regeneration of grasslands with fire created grains and productivity pulses for a suite 
of mammals; this niche creation meant increased populations of mammals and additional food (Table 3, Figure 4). In 
the south, tubers were more important food than grains but mosaic burning achieved the same for tuberous species 
(Gott 2005, 2008) (Table 2). Over the millennia, TO populations with the ‘fundamental human cognitive ability to utilise 
entire landscapes and the ability to schedule resources’ (Canning 2009) used fire to conserve and make predictable food 
resources. TO burning could maintain extensive grasslands–grassy field layers where landscape-scale edaphic factors 
favoured its persistence (e.g. geology, self-mulching clays, flooding regimes), grassy woodlands where eucalypt invasion 
could be ameliorated; and elsewhere in smaller patches (e.g. in swales) where micro-edaphic factors allowed fire assisted 
persistence of grasses. Within these broad environments, continual patch burning created habitat heterogeneity and 
increased the availability and efficiency of on-foot small game foragers in arid and semi-arid environments (Bliege Bird 
et al. 2008; Bird et al. 2013). These processes would have been continual, yet adaptive. TO-LM grasslands could be 
maintained across the Mallee and elsewhere providing productive pulses that supported meta-populations of smaller 
mammals (see text; Burch 2020) (Figures 1a & 5–8). 
Over time, direct observation would reveal that fire could be used for multiple objectives. Burning in patch-mosaics would 
enhance grassland productivity and food predictability across all trophic levels, but very important for small game (Bliege 
Bird et al. 2008); slow the encroachment of trees and shrubs (Figure 4) (Stefferson 2020); help avoid extensive bushfires; 
create habitats as species (including mammals) moved through the landscape, e.g. migration out from drought refugia 
(Newsome 1980); ameliorate drought; and conserve mature vegetation and refugia. Cumulative observational knowledge 
could be preserved, incorporated into TO lore, and passed down through dreamtime stories, ceremony, totems etc. into 
a fully integrated world view.
Numbat
The 
predominantly 
termite 
diet 
of 
the 
Numbat 
(Myrmecobius fasciatus) does not appear to fit into the 
grassland pulse model and the impacts of patch burning 
on termites are largely unknown (Friend 1998). Krefft 
(1865a) reported one place it was common about 20 
miles northwest of Mildura (Wakefield 1966), probably in 
grassy woodland. Platform termites (Drepanotermes spp.) 
consume grasses with densities reflecting the productivity 
of grasses (Sluiter pers. comm 2021). Along the Murray 
River, termites are abundant in forests that are infrequently 
inundated (Yen et al. 2002). As a recent planned burn 
controversy in WA indicates, fire was used by Traditional 
Owners in the management of Numbat habitat, often in 
order to avoid large bushfires (Stefferson 2020; ABC 2021; 
Parletta 2021).
Wombats
Both species of hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus spp., 
weighing c. 30 kg.) were marginal to the region and also 
soon became extinct therein (not included in Table 3). Their 
size and diets are similar to the large grazing macropods 
(e.g. M. fuliginosus, M. giganteus). As grass eaters they 
would have benefited from TO-LM of grasslands, but it 
is unlikely they were reliant upon the productivity pulse 
(Figure 2). Their larger body mass and denning habit 
enabled use of a less nutrient-rich diet (QDES 2021). 
The eastern limit of the Southern Hairy-nosed Wombat 
extended to around Euston (north of the Murray River). 
By the turn of the nineteenth century, persecution and 
rabbits were implicated in its demise (Swinbourne et al. 
2017). However, a population remains at Dunedin Park 
Station east of Lake Victoria, in far southwest NSW. 
The Northern Hairy-nosed Wombat (Lasiorhinus krefftii) 
persisted in at least three isolated populations (NSW and 
Queensland) at the time of European contact, one of which 
occurred around Jerilderie (eastern border of our region), 
with satellite populations at Barooga on the Murray River 
where they were ‘in their thousands’. These large grazers 
required a year-round supply of grass and deep sandy soils,

the latter for burrowing. Significantly, they survived sheep 
grazing but were later exterminated as their burrows were 
havens for rabbits, which arrived in 1879 (>1000 wombats 
were killed on one property in one year) (Swinbourne et 
al. 2017). The last specimen was collected at Jerilderie in 
1884.
Large macropods
The more generalist grazers, large macropods (Red 
Kangaroo Macropus rufus, Grey Kangaroo M. giganteus, 
Black-faced Kangaroo M. fuliginosus and Euro M. 
robusta) exploited TO-LM grassland burning but were not 
dependent on the productivity pulse (Figure 2). Indeed,

Box 2: A history of other iconic biota associated with TO-LM grasslands in the Murray–Darling Basin
Murnong (Yam Daisies, Microseris spp.) were a staple food of the TOs, more so in the south of our region areas where 
tubers were a more significant part of TO diet (Gott 2005). Three recognized species remain extant, all threatened — 
none having a particularly large tuber (Walsh 2016). However, the complex of M. walteri is being further reviewed with 
a distinctive semi-arid ‘form’ having much enlarged tubers (Walsh 2016; Ian Sluiter and Walsh pers. comm., 2021). It is 
likely that TO created cultivars of the plant; they traded seeds and there are numerous historical accounts of managed 
yam grounds (Curr 1883; Gott 2008; Mansergh & Cheal 2019). Abundance was linked to the grassland-fire system and 
such tuberous species feature in a suite of mammalian and insect diets (Table 3).  Over-abundant large macropods may 
deplete Murnong but were not common where this yam daisy was prolific (Curr 1883; Sluiter, pers. obs., 2021). Even 
under a depleted TO fire regime, extensive areas of TO-LM grasslands remained to be targeted by sheep and Murnong 
were very rapidly eliminated across the landscape (Mitchell, 1834; Curr, 1883; Gott, 2005). 
A tetrapoid variant of Themeda triandra has characteristics of semi-arid and drought adaptations: taller, less tussocky, 
prolonged and multiple seed set (Morgan and Bryceson, pers. comm., May 2021). It was more widespread north of the 
Great Dividing Range, most likely the tussock grass observed by Curr (1883) but its range drastically reduced (sheep, hot 
summer fires competition of annuals etc.). A remnant population persists around Terrappee Cemetery (Dja Dja Wurrung 
country, near Boort, Vic) which has provided a century-long refugium. Presence in northern grasslands and grassy mallee 
would have provided additional seed sources (emergency food) and predictable, more flammable fuel for TO burning. 
The mass depletion of this variant and the Murnong indicates the large-scale changes in species and processes since 
cessation of TO-LM. Early expansion of native annuals (Austrostipa etc.) readily expanded into TO-LM grasslands with 
changed grazing–fire regimes brought by the pastoralists (McIvor 2005; Allen 1983). 
Bogong Moths (Agrotis infusa) have their natal sites in the self-mulching soils (grasslands) of southern Queensland, 
western NSW and Victoria and occur in their billions (Green et al. 2021). They (larvae and adults) provided food for 
TOs and a suite of mammals in Table 3.  The larvae eat roots of forbs (e.g. yam daisies) rather than grasses so were 
advantaged under TO-LM (Figure 3). Survival was assisted by prey-switching and they became an agricultural pest 
(Common 1954). The massive annual migration to the alps persisted until recently when agricultural intensification and 
pesticides have caused populations to crash (Mansergh & Heinze 2019; Warrant et al. 2016; Green et al.  2021).

they may have had their ‘own country’ under TO-LM 
(Newsome 1980). As noted by Mitchell (1834) Traditional 
Owners burnt grasslands around rocky outcrops and 
escarpments (Euro habitat) and kangaroos could be absent 
on some plains and obvious on others. After the cessation 
of TO-LM (and predation) and persecution of the other 
apex predator, the Dingo (Canis dingo), populations went 
from rare to abundant (e.g. Curr 1883). By 1860, which 
was well before the arrival of rabbits, extensive over-
grazing and the proliferation of water points (wells and 
dams after 1870) led to massive increases in kangaroo 
numbers throughout the inland (Krefft 1865a; Frith 1973; 
Rolls 1969; Allen 1983; Strahan 1998a). This sudden rise 
of the large generalist grazers would have eliminated any 
remaining areas of grassland productivity pulses, as trophic 
level changes cascaded across the landscape (Ripple & 
Beschta 2003).
Special places
However, all the subject species were Traditional Owner 
food resources and connected to their lore and rites (e.g. 
Bird et al. 2013; Sutton & Walshe 2021). Newsome (1980) 
showed the deep ecological understanding behind the 
Arunta’s sacred site and song lines of the totemic Red 
Kangaroo (drought refugia and repopulation routes). Bird 
et al. (2013) concluded that through their dreaming, fire 
management of grasslands and hunting, the Martu people 
could create niches that supported persistence of species 
on country. Most species listed in Table 3, and other biota 
associated with the productive pulse (e.g. Yam daisies, 
Bogong moth; Howitt 1904) were totems of some resident 
Traditional Owners and each would have benefited from 
consequent land management obligations and imperatives.
Totems of the southern semi-arid Wotjobaluk included 
both Dasyurus spp., Dingo, possum, bandicoot, red and 
grey kangaroos and fire (Howitt 1904). The D. viverrinus 
(as Yung) remains the spirit (totem) of the Yung Balug 
people in the Boort area (Dja Dja Wurrung country). 
There were probably many of these totemic places of 
importance in lore spread across the region (individuals 
had multiple totems, with numerous clans in each of the 
language groups). Lack of management of these totemic 
places probably accelerated landscape ecological decline. 
Before arrival of the fox and rabbit, Daisy Bates recorded 
the mass depletion and extinction of the Jinyila clans and 
their associated mammal totems (= clan name) from Point 
Malcolm across the Nullarbor into South Australia (Bates 
1985; Bolam 1926).
DISCUSSION
Williams et al. (2015) and Mooney et al. (2011) explored 
the relationship between Aboriginal population indices 
and fire in Australia, at both continental and regional levels 
over the last 20  000 years. They found weak statistical 
correlation between these factors at both scales but 
short-lived synchronous responses (around 10‒7 ka, 5‒4 
ka and 1.2‒08 ka) could be explained by climate. They 
argued that, at the macro scale, there were no long-lasting 
impacts on the biota that required an explanation by human 
agency. However, they did not discount the possibility of 
systematic or deliberate manipulation of the fire regimes at 
local scales. Williams et al. (2015) concluded that ‘further 
empirical research is required to explore the relationship 
between known fire events of different scale and intensity 
and the contemporary charcoal record’. We concur.
Although the decline of the mammals of the mid-
Murray–Darling region has been extensively assessed 
by numerous authors, all essentially concluded that the 
primary cause was the additions of the European invasion 
(ungulates, rabbits, cats, foxes etc.). The role of the loss 
of TO-LM was generally ignored or dismissed (Bennett 
et al. 1989; Dickman 1994; Menkhorst 2009). Menkhorst 
(2009), using the postulate of Allen (1983), thought the 
hypothesis of cessation of TO-LM as a primary cause of 
these regional extinctions was plausible. Nevertheless, 
he rejected it as it did not explain either the rapidity of 
declines (using the time for vegetation to evolve to new 
seral stage) or the lack of evidence that mosaic burning was 
undertaken across the landscape. In contrast, our results 
show that it was the subtraction (c. 1830) of TO-LM mosaic 
burning of grasslands and loss of the productive pulse that 
best explains the initially rapid collapse of mammalian 
populations across the landscape. Those mammals most 
dependent on this pulse decreased first. Across these 
degrading and out-of-balance ecosystems many species 
were in extinction vortices. Any remnant or refugial 
mammalian populations became increasingly vulnerable 
to consequent changes, such as over-grazing (ungulates 
and larger macropods), novel predators and clearing. The 
evidence above shows that TO-LM, including the careful 
use of targeted fire across the entire landscape, kept the 
invading eucalypts at bay, lessened extensive bushfires 
(thus conserving mature vegetation) and provided food 
across otherwise less hospitable environments. 
There was a combination of reasons why the southeast 
region was the first to suffer such catastrophic losses. The 
former faunal complement included arid and mesic species, 
some at the edges of their ranges. The Murray River area 
supported among the highest densities of Aborigines on 
the continent and the landscape was managed to support 
these populations (Mulvaney 1971; Burch 2017; Williams

POPULATION COLLAPSES IN THE SEMI-ARID REGION OF THE MURRAY‒DARLING BASIN, SOUTHEASTERN AUSTRALIA
et al. 2015). The flat and relatively uniform topography of 
the plains country supported no large refugial areas. Reed 
beds (along rivers and in deflation lake-basins) lost TO-
LM and were depleted by pastoralists (e.g. Curr 1883). 
Dowling (1997 & 2021) documented the impact of a series 
of infectious diseases leading to massive depopulation 
of Traditional Owners, effectively and rapidly ending 
millennia-long TO-LM (including mosaic burning), and 
initiating an ecologically traumatic event with no recovery 
once Europeans invaded to exploit their grasslands.
In the Pilliga–Coonabarabran region, to the immediate 
northeast of our study area, Rolls (1981) described the 
extent and ecological effects of Traditional Owner burning 
and its cessation on native vegetation, leading to increases 
in large fires and expansion of forests. His assessments 
and disdain for the previous scientific discountenance 
of Traditional Owner burning are in accord with our 
postulates.
In analysing the twentieth-century attrition and 
extinction of species in WA (and across Australia) Burbidge 
and McKenzie (1989) attributed the loss of native fauna 
to the loss of available productivity, most pronounced 
in Critical Weight Range mammals that had relatively 
high metabolic requirements (c.f. reptiles) and lesser 
mobility (c.f. birds). They also noted that many mammal 
disappearances broadly followed Traditional Owners 
leaving country and recognized that changed fire regimes 
may have contributed (Burbidge 1985; Burbidge et al. 
1988; Burbidge & McKenzie 1989). Our investigations 
indicate that Traditional Owner patch burning maintained 
and enhanced available productivity in a closed self-
reinforcing regenerative system, also resulting in elevated 
populations of the associated fauna (Figure 2, Table 3). 
The subtraction of this ecological agency best explains 
the progressive mammalian population collapses in this 
landscape. These collapses were first manifest in the 
Murray‒Darling basin. Acknowledging this as the primary 
cause does not diminish the extent of the consequent loss 
of productivity caused by the degradation and export of 
nutrients resulting from the addition of sheep and cattle, 
and other associated changes.
In 1953, many Martu people left their country in WA. 
In 1964, the last traditional nomads of the northern Martu 
were finally ‘cleared out’ of country for the Woomera rocket 
testing (Davenport et al. 2005a,b). Yuwait, a 16-year-old at 
the time, recorded that they always carried fire sticks, burning 
country as they went, which produced larger numbers of 
food-bearing plants and significantly more food and game 
(Davenport et al. 2005a,b; Latz 1995a,b). The Martu had 
captured Bilbys, Boodies and Mala by burning mature 
spinifex (Triodia spp.) grassland in the cool-dry season 
(Bird et al. 2013). The Martu returned to country in 1984 
and the Boodies and Mala were gone. The Greater Bilby, 
a dietary generalist, was able to persist but was rare (see 
Table 3). Populations of the Martu’s major food source, the 
Sand Goanna (Varanus gouldii), had dramatically declined 
but tight mosaic burning restored abundances (Bird et al. 
2013). Bird et al. (2013) also concluded that Martu land 
management (including fire and hunting) increased the 
abundance of Sand Goannas and created niches that could 
maintain the presence (and increase abundance) of species 
in their country when environmental conditions would 
otherwise be less favourable.
The extinction patterns of decline in this and other 
species across the semi-arid and arid zones in WA, SA 
and NT (e.g. Western-barred Bandicoot, Bilby and Lesser 
Bilby) broadly correlate with cessation or degradation of 
TO-LM (see species accounts in Bates 1985; Hercus 1985; 
Burbidge & McKenzie 1989; Strahan 1998a; Richards 
2012a,b; Bird et al. 2013; Peasley 2009). Coincidence or 
consequence?
The landscape and vegetation of the mid-Murray‒
Darling which the mammals inhabited, that the explorers 
saw and to which the squatters were attracted (Figure 1) 
were modified and managed by TO-LM fire for millennia. 
The grassland food base (attractive to Europeans) was 
maintained, eucalypt and woody shrub invasion managed 
and the risk of large bushfires minimized (Tindale 1959; 
Williams 1962). Over the millennia, mammal distributions 
and abundances and TO-LM would have responded to 
previous gross vegetation changes, e.g. the expansion 
of mallee shrublands (Luly 1990; Cupper 2005). New 
mammalian food sources in clan areas in the semi-arid 
zone are known from historical times (Bates 1985). Martu 
land management kept country habitable despite having 
among the lowest population densities on the continent. 
When they left country (1953) the mean size of all fires 
increased dramatically (about five orders of magnitude) 
and the extent of all kinds of mature vegetation was 
substantially lessened (Bird et al. 2013). Such bushfires 
hastened the demise of remnant populations, e.g. of Mala 
(Johnson & Burbidge 1998). Environmental modelling in 
arid and tropical savanna environments confirms that the 
persistence of mature vegetation is an emergent quality 
of landscape patch burning (Letnic & Dickman 2010; 
Trauernicht et al. 2015.)
This evidence suggests that TO-LM affected and 
effected the configuration of grasslands, mature vegetation 
and thus availability of mammal habitat in our study region 
(Figures 4 & 5). Co-evolution of TO-LM and preferred 
faunal habitat has been described to explain the most 
rapid mammal extinction in Victoria, that of Tchuteba 
(Conilurus albipes) (Mansergh & Cheal 2019). Bird et al. 
(2013) concluded patch burning for forage-hunting created

finer-grained habitat mosaics, created niches for a range of 
species that would not otherwise persist in the arid Martu 
country and optimized the productivity and predictability 
of faunal populations. Despite misinterpretation of early 
adverse experimental results of patch burning (Short & 
Turner 1994; see Hiscock & Wallis 2005), some form 
of patch burning has been successfully used in recovery 
programs of over six endangered mammal species on 
the mainland (e.g. Johnson & Burbidge 1998; Richards 
2012b). Traditional Owner societies managed the terrestrial 
mammal fauna through habitat manipulation, predation, 
niche creation and refugia protection (Newsome 1980; 
Bird et al. 2013). We conclude that the environment and 
the mammalian fauna (diversity and abundance) recorded 
by the first Europeans were an artefact of millennia of TO-
LM (Tindale 1959; Gammage 2012) (Box 1).
Patch burning in these zones has been replaced by 
increased frequency of large bushfires over the twentieth 
century (Bradstock et al. 2002; Bird et al. 2013). Such 
changing fire regimes are leading to adverse decadal 
changes in soil carbon and nitrogen and ecosystem 
productivity (Pellegrini et al. 2018).
The date of arrival of feral cats in Australia is uncertain 
and may predate European settlement. We suggest their 
arrival in the semi-arid zone of southeastern Australia was 
late and did not involve high densities until recently (after 
European settlement) (Abbott 2002). Although not present 
in our region at the time of collapse, foxes and cats have 
been strongly implicated in the continental extinction and 
decline of the Critical Weight Range mammals and this has 
regrettably become a simplistic summary of this impact 
(Burbidge & McKenzie 1989). That cats and foxes can 
extinguish small, remnant or otherwise stressed populations 
of Critical Weight Range mammals is not disputed. There 
have been many successful rescue and recovery efforts 
based on predator exclusion. From the 1980s, populations 
of arid and semi-arid zone mammals (including some listed 
in Table 3) have been successfully introduced to fox- and 
cat-free islands (WA and SA, e.g. Strahan 1998a; Richards 
2012a,b). From the mid-1990s, there have been successful 
releases into predator-proof exclosures, e.g. Scotia, Arid 
Recovery Reserve, Mt Rothwell Victoria, with many 
positive conservation outcomes (ARR 2021; Mt Rothwell 
2021; Anon 2020).
A fundamental (but largely ignored) question for all 
recovery efforts is what role did the cessation of TO-LM 
have in the decline of the species? Or is what we now 
recognize as ‘natural habitat’ free of prior anthropogenic 
processes? At the broader level, asking these questions may 
also inform the official enquiries into why, after 30 years, 
both State and Commonwealth biodiversity legislation 
(respectively, Victorian Flora & Fauna Guarantee Act 
1988 and the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity 
Conservation Act 1995) have failed to reverse ecosystem 
decline (see Victoria; Parliament 2021). 
Our re-evaluation of this ecological history has 
woven lines of evidence derived from many disciplines 
and provides a reasonably comprehensive and coherent 
explanation of the collapse of the mammal fauna, and we 
contend one better than the ‘additions’ argument and its 
variants. As history, it remains unprovable. However, the 
perspective it provides allows interpretation (and design) 
of ongoing science-based actions under various land-
management policies and species recovery plans (e.g. 
Richards 2012a,b). As patch burning and the mammals 
have been absent from the region for over 150 years and 
all environments are variously degraded, experimental 
design is difficult, but feasible. Focused research into the 
fundamental ecological drivers, fungi and invertebrates, 
of grasslands/grassy field layers and the productive pulse 
could test our basic thesis. Mammal exclosures (e.g. Arid 
Zone Recovery, Mt Rothwell) and other sites across the 
Victorian Mallee (e.g. Figure 7) are available and the 
increasing uptake of Traditional Owner mosaic burning, 
following Stefferson (2020), offers further opportunities.
The cosmology and economy of the Traditional Owner 
societies were rich and complex human endeavours 
(e.g. Tindale 1959; Bates 1985; Sutton & Walshe 2021). 
Traditional Owner persistence in situ over the millennia 
in an environment of changing drought, fire and flood 
regimes is a tribute to the knowledge, ingenuity and 
cultural strength of the Traditional Owners. They knew the 
‘where, when, what and why’ of the mammal fauna. The 
‘why’ was incorporated into their cosmology (lore, rites, 
totems) which embedded deep ecological understanding 
(Dawson 2009; Newsome 1980; Bird et al. 2013).
Under changing environmental conditions the mammal 
fauna adapted to, and benefited from, this ecological 
agency (TO-LM), which was brought to an abrupt end 
around 1830 in the mid-Murray‒Darling catchment. 
Disappearance of the grassland pulse, probably within five 
years, was an ecologically traumatic event which rapidly 
cascaded through ecosystems. Productivity declined, food-
chains (including predator–prey) degraded and mammal 
populations collapsed, many to extinction. Later extensive 
bushfires would further homogenize the environment. This 
subtraction opened the extinction vortex for the suite of 
mammals listed in Table 3. Subsequently, Europeans added 
further assaults on the ecosystems through the introduction 
of ungulates, feral predators and grazers, and persecution 
of the apex predator (Dingo Canis dingo), with additional 
adverse effects cascading through the ecosystems (Ripple 
& Beschta 2003).

SOMETHING WENT MISSING: CESSATION OF TRADITIONAL OWNER LAND MANAGEMENT AND RAPID MAMMALIAN 	
75
POPULATION COLLAPSES IN THE SEMI-ARID REGION OF THE MURRAY‒DARLING BASIN, SOUTHEASTERN AUSTRALIA
Mammal habitat and populations were manipulated 
and maintained without ‘domestication’ but what does this 
imply? Is this another version of ‘nomadic pastoralism’ 
sensu the Neolithic Britons (Harvey 2002)? Where does 
it fit in the current contentious debate about classification 
of Traditional Owner society as ‘aspects of agricultural’ 
(Pascoe 2014) or ‘hunter gatherer plus’ (Sutton & Walshe 
2021)? Traditional Owner societies had a custodianship, 
cosmology and deep ecological understanding that 
manipulated the relatively harsh and variable environments 
of a unique continent. We have attempted to clarify the 
ecological ‘whats’ and ‘hows’ of the period and subsequent 
processes. The semantics are left to others.
CONCLUSION
Traditional Owner land management and the associated 
mammalian fauna adapted to changes in climate and 
vegetation. In the mid-Murray‒Darling catchment, 
depopulation of the Traditional Owners from 1830, due to 
diseases, saw a disruption of landscape-scale management 
and it was subsequently extinguished by the early 1840s 
(Dowling 2011). The effect was rapid. Loss of the biological 
productivity pulse meant collapsing mammal populations, 
as observed by the Nyeri Nyeri and Krefft in 1856–7.
These declines were precipitous in this region and 
progressively continued across the continent into the 
next century, with progressive declines and extinctions of 
associated mammals (Burbidge & McKenzie 1989; Bird 
et al. 2013). Importantly, this fundamental ecological 
trauma began decades prior to standard explanations of 
continental scale mammalian decline (Gould 1863; Jones 
1923; Troughton 1973; Ride 1970) and in this region 
(Dickman 1994; Menkhorst 1995; Bennett et al. 1989). It 
follows that many descriptions of ‘natural’ habitats were 
in reality of artefacts of intentional human intervention, 
as Edward Curr so long ago recognized (see also Mitchell 
1838; Tindale 1959; Bird et al. 2013). The ecological 
agency of TO-LM has been ignored, neglected or restricted 
in the zoological and ecological literature. With very few 
exceptions, such denial continued after Tindale’s (1959) 
insightful recognition of Aboriginal ecological agency. 
Clear understanding and recognition of causal factors 
is a necessary precursor to better land management. Our 
analysis has been focused on ecology and mammals; 
however, our conclusions (and many references herein) 
suggest that the term ‘natural environment’, implying ‘free 
of human agency’, should be used much more cautiously. 
It is likely another colonial overhang. Without more 
rigour, conclusions reached and, most importantly, actions 
derived, from research of the ‘natural environment’ may be 
misleading.
Our current understanding, and thus efforts to 
ameliorate, ecosystem decline would be greatly improved 
by consideration of the subtractions rather than only the 
additions (notably of stock grazing and feral predators) of 
our history. The mammals were the most susceptible fauna 
to the loss of productivity (Burbidge & McKenzie 1989). 
Their declines were the first observed; however, that does 
not mean immunity for other groups and elsewhere. We 
consider the ‘window’ described here is applicable not 
only to other mammals (e.g. Bridled Nailtail Wallaby, 
Hairy-nosed Wombats, and the ‘perplexing’ declines 
of bandicoots — Opie et al. 1990) but also to avifauna 
(e.g. Australian Bustard in the south) and reptiles. The 
observations of Bird et al. (2013) on the decline of Sand 
Goanna are as cautionary as its recovery is inspiring and 
illuminating. Indeed, large-scale and long-term adverse 
trophic level ecological cascades can be reversed when 
the primary cause is identified and remedied (Ripple & 
Beschta 2003).
In Victoria, at the strategic and regional level, Traditional 
Owners themselves are re-asserting the need for traditional 
burning in restoring country and biodiversity (DDWCAC 
2014; FVTOC 2019; O’Kane et al. 2019). This eco-history 
suggests that under future warming climates, re-institution 
of some form of TO-LM (in its broadest sense including 
fire, apex predator) would assist not only the biota but 
also with other major urgent national problems. The 
avoidance of increasingly catastrophic fires would lower 
CO2 emissions and increase the capacity for carbon bio-
sequestration in the arid semi-arid landscape (through an 
increase in the area of mature vegetation). 
After 30 years, once-thought progressive legislation 
at State and Commonwealth levels is being reviewed, as 
ecosystems and species continue to decline. The catalogue 
of ‘whitefella’ additions to what was then regarded as terra 
nullius cannot be ignored in these continuing declines. 
But it never was terra nullius. Large parts of the ‘natural’ 
environment directly reflected human agency (Tindale 
1959; Gott 2008). These additions have been blamed but 
there has been little acknowledgement of the subtraction of 
the millennia-long major ecological agent — Traditional 
Owner land management. Our explanation for the early 
demise of the suite of mammals from the Murray‒Darling 
region, and subsequently across Australia, is that subtraction 
of Traditional Owner land management initiated these 
declines. From this perspective new approaches arise. 
Perhaps the basis of improved restoration of ecosystem 
health is best derived from an understanding of, respect for, 
and inclusion of the traditional knowledge that underpinned 
continental land management for millennia.
