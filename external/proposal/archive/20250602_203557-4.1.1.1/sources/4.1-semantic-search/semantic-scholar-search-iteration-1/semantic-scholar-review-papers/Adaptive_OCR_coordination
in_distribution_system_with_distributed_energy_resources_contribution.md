More and more distributed energy resources (DERs) are being
added to the medium-voltage (MV) or low-voltage (LV) radial
distribution networks (RDNs). These distributed power
sources will cause the redistribution of power flow and fault

strategy is proposed in this paper. It will trace the
connectivity of the system structure to determine the set of
relay numbers as a tracking path. According to the topology
of the system structure, the tracking path can be divided into
two categories: the main feeder path and the branch path.
The time multiplier setting (TMS) of each relay can be used to
evaluate the operation time of the over-current relay (OCR),
and the operation time of the relay can be used to evaluate
the fitness of the TMS setting combination. Furthermore, the
relay protection coordination problem can be modeled to
minimize the accumulated summation of all primary and
backup relay operation time (OT) subject to the coordination
time interval (CTI) limitation. A modified particle swarm
optimization (MPSO) algorithm with adaptive self-cognition
and society operation scheme (ASSOS) was proposed and
utilized to determine TMS for each relay on the tracking path.
A 16-bus test MV system with distributed generators (DGs)
will be applied to test the adaptive protection coordination
approach proposed in this paper. The results show that the
proposed MPSO algorithm reduces the overall OT and relieves
the impact on protection coordination settings after DG joins
the system. The paper also tests and compares the proposed
MPSO with other metaheuristic intelligence-based random
search algorithms to prove that MPSO possesses with
increased efficiency and performance.
