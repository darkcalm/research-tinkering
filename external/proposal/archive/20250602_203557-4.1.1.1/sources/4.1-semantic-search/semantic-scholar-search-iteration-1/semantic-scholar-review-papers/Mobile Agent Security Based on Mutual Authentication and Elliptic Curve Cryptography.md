Abstract: Mobile agent system is a satisfying
solution for the implementation and maintenance of
applications distributed over large-scale networks,
this solution is very used in solving complex
problems since they are autonomous, Intelligent,
robust and fault�tolerant. Mobile agents have the
capacity to migrate from one node to another all
over 
the 
network 
allowing 
reduction 
in
communication costs. Although they possess all

these advantages, using them in distributed
environment increases the threat to mobile agent
security and during their mobility they can face
different types of attacks such as of attacks like
Replay attack, man-in-the-middle attack, Cookie
theft attack, Offline password guessing attack,
Stolen-verifier attack. In this paper we investigate
the security of distributed mobile agent system. We
propose a solution based on a secure Elliptic Curve
Cryptography (ECC) protocol to ensure mutual
authentication and protect the agent from different
known attacks. The implementation of the proposed
solution is obtained using Java Agent Development
Framework (JADE). Also, Binary serialization is
used to establish a flexible portability of the agent.
Finally, we present security and performance
analysis, for our solution to secure mobile agent in
distributed systems.
Keywords: Binary Serialization, Elliptic Curve
Cryptography (ECC), JADE, Mobile Agent, Mutual
