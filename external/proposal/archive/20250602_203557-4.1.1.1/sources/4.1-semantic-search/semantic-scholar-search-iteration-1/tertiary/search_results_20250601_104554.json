Selecting the proper communication protocol in microservices is critical to achieving optimal system performance. This study compares the performance of three commonly used API protocols: REST, GraphQL, and gRPC, in microservices architecture. In this study, we established three microservices implemented in three containers and each microservice contained a Redis and MySQL database. We evaluated the performance of these API protocols using two key performance metrics: response time and CPU Utilization. This study performs two distinct data retrieval: fetching flat data and fetching nested data, with a number of requests ranging from 100 to 500 requests. The experimental results indicate that gRPC has a faster response time, followed by REST and GraphQL. Moreover, GraphQL shows higher CPU Utilization compared to gRPC and REST. The experimental results provide insight for developers and architects seeking to optimize their microservices communication protocols for specific use cases and workloads."

      "abstract": "A Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is a network that may be worn on the human body or implanted in the human body to transmit data, audio, and video in real-time to assess how vital organs are performing. A WBAN may be either an inter-WBAN or an intra-WBAN network. Intra-WBAN communication occurs when the various body sensors can share information. This is known as inter-WBAN communication, which occurs when two or more WBANs can exchange data with one another. One difficulty involves getting data traffic from wireless sensor nodes to the gateway with as little wasted energy, dropped packets, and downtime as possible. In this paper, the WBAN protocols have been compared with WBAN under Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and the performance of various parameters has been analysed for different simulation areas. The WBAN under the PSO protocol reduces the energy consumption by 43.2% against the SIMPLE protocoldue to the effective selection of forwarding nodes based on PSO optimization. In addition to that the experimental WBAN testbed is conducted in indoor environment to study the performance of the routing metrics towards energy and packet reception.."

      "abstract": "When UAVs are sent out for investigation such as battlefield reconnaissance, data from different UAVs should be transmitted to a central station, forming convergecast communication traffic. When infrastructure support is not available, data travels along a multi-hop routing path to the destination, and a routing protocol is needed to find these paths. In this work, we evaluate one commonly used protocol, BATMAN-adv, on commercially available Wi-Fi chipsets in embedded systems. We find that BATMAN-adv can form the desired routing paths, but the efficiency can be improved. In particular, this protocol does not consider traffic from other sources, and may lead to crowded paths. In addition, TCP works mostly well on the found routing paths, and its performance is comparable to UDP, but its built-in resource allocation mechanism may not meet an application's need. Consequently, both routing protocols and transport layer protocol should be revised to better suit convergecast applications."

The 5G millimeter wave (mmWave) communication technology can enhance the environment sensing ability of different isolated vehicles. In this paper, a joint sensing and communication integrated system (JSCIS) is designed to support the dynamic frame structure configuration for sensing and communication dual functions based on the 5G New Radio protocol in the mmWave frequency band, which can solve the low latency and high data rate problems of raw sensing data sharing among CAVs. To evaluate the timeliness of raw sensing data transmission, the best time duration allocation ratio of sensing and communication dual functions for one vehicle is achieved by modeling the <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$M/M/1$</tex-math></inline-formula> queuing problem using the age of information (AoI) in this paper. Furthermore, the resource allocation optimization problem among multiple CAVs is formulated as a non-cooperative game using the radar mutual information as a key indicator. And the feasibility and existence of pure strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) are proved theoretically, and a centralized time resource allocation (CTRA) algorithm is proposed to achieve the best feasible pure strategy NE. Finally, both simulation and hardware testbed are designed, and the results show that the proposed CTRA algorithm can improve the radar total mutual information by 26<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula>, and the feasibility of the proposed JSCIS is achieved with an acceptable radar ranging accuracy within <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\pm$</tex-math></inline-formula> 0.25\u00a0m, as well as a stable data rate of 2.8\u00a0Gbps using the 28\u00a0GHz mmWave frequency band."

The mobile nodes in MANETs are randomly connected and their location and functioning keeps on changing based on the situation and network application requirement. However, the nodes in MANETs are battery powered which is one of the limiting factors in their performance. However, seamless and longer duration connectivity depends upon the lifetime of individual nodes. The power consumption during transmission is the critical design issue in MANET's. This work involves the performance evaluation of a designed MANET scenario with variation in transmission power using Ad-hoc On-Demand Multipath Distance Vector (AOMDV) Routing Protocol (RP) at variable node configuration. The performance of designed MANET scenario is evaluated using several qualitative performance metrics for optimum performance using QualNet simulator."

The vehicles are connecting in an ad hoc manner to create a network of a wider range. In an intelligent transport system (ITS), with vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication in the VANET is used to support the network backbone and which the accident prevention technique has been deployed for ensuring the road safety. The major reason for the road accident is the abnormal driving behavior of human drivers. The movement pattern of the vehicle is the main factor of the network topology so that the impact of human driving pattern influences the performance and behavior of the network. Driving behavior can be classified as reckless, normal, drunken, and fatigue driving. During driving, the behavior of human drivers was predicted in this paper, thereby providing the performance analysis on the mobility of the network. For the improvement of a driver behavior, the hybridized mega\u2010trend diffusion (MTD) with optimized deep belief network\u2013sunflower optimization (DBN\u2010SFO) is used. Here, the network performance of the adaptive deer hunting Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (ADHOLSR) is analyzed in NS2 simulation platform."

      "abstract": "The IEEE 802.15.6 standard has the potential to provide cost-effective and unobtrusive medical services to individuals with chronic health conditions. It is a low-power standard developed for wireless body area networks and enables wireless communication inside or near a human body. This standard utilizes a Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol to improve network performance under different channel access priorities. However, the CSMA/CA proposed in the IEEE 802.15.6 standard has poor throughput performance and link reliability when some of the nodes deployed on a human body are hidden from each other. We employ the RTS/CTS scheme to solve hidden node problems in IEEE 802.15.6 networks over a lossy channel. To improve performance of the RTS/CTS scheme, we adjust transmission power levels of the nodes according to transmission failures. We estimate throughput and energy consumption of the proposed model by differentiating several parameters, such as contention window size, values of bit error ratios, number of nodes in different priority classes. The performance results are obtained through analytical approximations and simulations. We observe that the proposed model significantly improves performance of the IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA by resolving hidden node problems."

IPv6-enabled 6LoWPAN is a low-power, low-range communication protocol designed and developed for the short-range IoT applications. 6LoWPAN is based on IEEE 802.15.4 protocol and IPv6 network protocol for low range wireless applications. Although 6LoWPAN supports different routing protocols, RPL is the widely used routing protocol for low power and lossy networks. In this work, we have taken an IoT enabled smart home environment, in which 6LoWPAN is used as a communication and RPL as a routing protocol. The performance of this proposed network model is analyzed based on the different performance metrics such as latency, PDR, and throughput. The proposed model is simulated using Cooja simulator running over the Contiki OS. Along with the Cooja simulator, the network analyzer tool Wireshark is used to analyze the network behaviors."

      "abstract": "Recent days witnessed considerable developments in the field of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The applications of these networks can be seen in the simple consumer electronic devices as well as in the advanced space technology. The communication protocols are of prior importance and interest; the low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) protocol is used to enhance the performance of power consumption for the WSNs nodes. The efficiency of a wireless network can be affected by different factors, such as the size of the WSN and the initial energy of the sensor node. This can inspire the researchers to develop the optimum structure of the WSNs to get its desired functionality. In this paper, the performance of the low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) protocol is investigated using MATLAB to study the effect of the initial energy of the sensor node and the WSN size on the number of the running nodes. It is found that increasing the initial energy of a sensor node increases the life time of the node and hence the number of the running nodes. It has been also approved that the WSN size has an inverse proportion with the number of running sensor nodes during the use of LEACH protocol."

It stands as one of the most popular technologies for the following years and it is requiring substantial changes in the Internet protocols to meet its requirements. As the application layer is decisive for the quality of the connection, this paper analyzes the performance offered by one of the most popular protocols for the application layer in IoT: the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). This analysis aims to examine the features and capabilities of this protocol and to determine its feasibility to operate under constrained devices using security support. For this, a realistic network scenario is deployed to run the simulations and to measure bandwidth, consumption of resources (i.e., CPU cycles and bandwidth usage) and communication latency. Additionally, the trade-off between security and performance is discussed measuring the bandwidth overhead and the consumption increase associated to secure the communications. Different ciphering and authentication algorithms are tested, following the recommendations made by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)."

      "abstract": "Automobile industry is rapidly growing with new technologies. One of such prominent technologies is communication and network connectivity. New era smart vehicles are coming equipped with network adaptors for data connectivity. Modern smart vehicles are aided with hundreds or sensors and manufactures are working on making all sensors and driving statistics to make available to centralized cloud servers for different applications using IoT and cloud technologies making Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Even manufactures are working on some advance features like actuator control and vehicle control and telemetry using data network infrastructure. This work is focused on a proposed novel vehicular protocol data unit (VPDU) and its complete layered network stack implementation framework for vehicle to everything (V2X) communication in an urban scenario. For validation of network framework and evaluation of performance matrices, the simulated vehicular area network (VAN) is proposed in an urban scenario using complete network stack and terrain data in QualNet\u00ae simulator. Two industry standard MAC protocols as IEEE 802.11a and 802.11p. AODV, Bellman-Ford and OSPFv2 are used as routing protocols to analyze the network performance for all test cases. IEEE 802.11p MAC shows significant performance improvements from 802.11a counterparts with the proposed novel VPDU in a typical urban VAN scenario. The IEEE 802.11p MAC outperforms 802.11a with 11% less overall End-to-End delay, 29% overall less average jitter and overall 127% increase in packet delivery ratio (PDR). AODV routing protocol performs the best with minimum latency and packet error by improving PDR. The detailed performance analysis is presented in the scope of the paper."

      "abstract": "The LoRaWAN communication protocol can be used for the implementation of the IoT (Internet of Things) concept. Currently, most of the information regarding the scalability of the LoRa technology is commercial and deals with the best-case scenario. Thus, we need realistic models, enabling the proper assessment of the performance level. Most of the time, the IoT concept entails a large number of nodes distributed over a wide geographical area, therefore forming a high density, large-scale architecture. It is important to determine the number of collisions so that we can assess the network performance. The present paper aims at assessing the performance level of the LoRaWAN technology by analyzing the number of packet collisions that can occur. Thus, this paper determines the maximum number of LoRa nodes that can communicate with a Gateway considering the LoRaWAN protocol specifications. Furthermore, we have proposed a series of solutions for reducing the number of collisions and increasing the capacity of the communication channel."

The sensor node drifting along with ocean current offers 4D (space and time) monitoring for real-time underwater application. However, the main challenge arises from the underwater acoustic communication that results in high propagation delay, packet loss and overhead in the network. In order to overcome these issues, a depth adjustment and void aware pressure routing protocol is proposed for UWSN. A greedy forwarding strategy is used to forward the packet. In case a node fails to forward the packet using greedy forwarding strategy, then it immediately switches to the recovery mode. In the recovery mode, the node determines the new depth using particle swarm optimization technique. The global best value gives the new depth with minimum displacement. The void node forwards the packet with minimum displacement without any packet loss and delay."

More specifically, we assess the protocol performance in terms of achieved range, packet delivery ratio, and penetration capability using commonly used off-the-shelf devices. Furthermore, we conduct a power characterization of the protocol under different operating modes and compare its power consumption to that of a typical WiFi approach. The evaluation results show that environmental factors such as reflections and obstacles heavily affect the overall performance.

      "abstract": "The increasing demand for Internet of Things (IoT) applications has resulted in vast amounts of data, requiring the utilization of big data analytics. The integration of big data analytics in IoT-based smart cities can greatly benefit from the development of wireless communication protocols, among which the Thread protocol has emerged as a promising option. Thread is IEEE 802.15.4 based and has advanced capabilities like mesh networking, IPv6 support, and multiple gateways providing no single point of failure. This paper presents the design and evaluation of a low-cost mesh network using Raspberry Pi, nRF52840 dongle, and OpenThread 1.2 (i.e., an open-source software implementation of the Thread protocol stack). The research elaborates on the hardware and software solutions used, as well as the network topologies adopted. To evaluate the performance of the developed system, extensive real-time tests are performed, considering parameters, such as jitter, packet loss, and round trip time. These tests effectively demonstrate the effectiveness of the Thread network. Furthermore, the impact of varying payload size and bitrate on the network is analyzed to understand its influence. The behavior of the multi-hop network is also examined under link failure scenarios, providing insights into the network\u2019s robustness. Our findings provide valuable insights for researchers interested in designing low-cost and efficient mesh networks for various IoT applications, including home automation, building/campus monitoring systems, distributed industrial IoT applications, and smart city infrastructure."

Real-time communication, facilitated by streaming media protocols, utilizes peer-to-peer or client-server models to enhance Quality of Service (QoS). WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) stands as a widely adopted, browser-based, open-source, peer-to-peer protocol, offering real-time media transmission through JavaScript APIs without third-party plugins. This paper presents an in-depth performance evaluation of a WebRTC-based video conferencing system using Socket.io services on a Node.js server. Our research expands on recent studies by introducing a comprehensive set of performance parameters, including Processing delay, CPU Utilization, Latency, Jitter, and Packet Loss, and packet delay. Our findings indicate that WebRTC performs exceptionally well within specific latency thresholds. However, scalability concerns emerge when a large number of clients are introduced, especially in bandwidth-constrained environments."

In this paper, we evaluate the performance of Thread protocol for lighting systems using a practical testbed setup in an office area. We focus our evaluation on unicast and multicast, which are the two most important communication paradigms for lighting applications. The unicast and multicast of Thread are tested under various communication parameters, such as concurrent multicast sources, hop distance from the source to the destination, communication interval, etc. The key performance indicators include end-to-end latency, time for complete coverage, synchronization, and packet delivery ratio. In addition, we use the measurement results of unicast and multicast in some typical lighting applications to analyze its impact on user experience. Through our extensive experiment and analysis, we conclude that the performance of Thread multicast and unicast has much leeway to meet the requirements of lighting systems."

These applications are starting from remote monitoring of patient's parameters in home to monitoring patients during his life activities at work, transportation, etc. So we can monitor patients at any place outside of hospitals and clinical settings. By using this technology, we can save lives and reduce the number of emergency visits to hospitals. In contemporary time, there are great progress and opportunities for the internet of things (IoT) related E-health systems. Most IoT e-health platforms consist of three main parts; client nodes (patient or doctor), IoT server and IoT communication messaging protocol. One of E-health systems design over IoT challenge is choosing the most suitable IoT messaging protocol for E-health applications. In this paper, IoT remote patient and e-Health monitoring system was designed for monitoring physiological medical signals of patients based on most two famous IoT messaging protocols, MQTT and CoAP. These medical signals can be include parameters like heart rate signals, electro-cardio graph (ECG), patient temperature, blood pressure, etc. This practical comparison between CoAP and MQTT is to choose most suitable for e-health systems. The proposed approach was evaluated based on most significant protocol parameters like capability, efficiency, communication method and message delay. Practical and simulation results show the performance of the proposed E-health systems over IoT for different network infrastructure with different losses percentages."

MQTT for Sensor Networks (MQTT-SN), which is a lightweight version of MQTT, allows the use of UDP, however, is strongly coupled to MQTT by the current specification and cannot be operated independently of it.

This emerging form of networking is construct of flying nodes known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that fly at a fast rate of speed, causing frequent changes in the network topology and connection failures. As a result, there is no dedicated FANET routing protocol that enables effective communication between these devices. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the performance of the category of topology-based routing protocols in the FANET. In a surveillance system involving video traffic, four routing protocols with varying routing mechanisms were examined. Additionally, simulation experiments conducted to determine the influence of flying altitude. The results indicate that hybrid routing protocols outperform other types of protocols in terms of average throughput. Proactive protocols, on the other hand, have the least jitter."

      "abstract": "The Internet of Drones (IoD) is a networking architecture that stems from the interplay between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and wireless communication technologies. Networked drones can unleash disruptive scenarios in many application domains. At the same time, to really capitalize on their potential, accurate modeling techniques are required to seize the fine details that characterize the features and limitations of UAVs, wireless communications, and networking protocols. To this end, the present contribution proposes the IoD simulator (IoD-Sim), a comprehensive and versatile open source tool that addresses the many facets of the IoD. IoD-Sim is a network simulator 3 (ns-3)-based simulator organized into a 3-layer stack, composed of: 1) the Underlying Platform, which provides the telecommunication primitives for different standardized protocol stacks; 2) the Core, that implements all the fundamental features of an IoD scenario; and 3) the Simulation Development Platform, mainly composed of a set of tools that speeds up the graphical design for every possible use case. In order to prove the huge potential of this proposal, three different scenarios are presented and analyzed from both a software perspective and a telecommunications standpoint. The peculiarities of this open-source tool are of interest for researchers in academia, as they will be able to extend it to model upcoming specifications, including, but not limited to, mobile and satellite communications. Still, it will certainly be of relevance in industry to accelerate the design phase, thus reducing the time to market of IoD-based services."
