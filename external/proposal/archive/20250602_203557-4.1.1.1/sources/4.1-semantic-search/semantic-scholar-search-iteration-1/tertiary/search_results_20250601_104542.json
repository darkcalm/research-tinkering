      "abstract": "The rapid growth of renewable energy systems necessitates advanced strategies for maintenance and optimization to ensure long-term operational efficiency and sustainability. Traditional approaches often fall short in predicting failures and optimizing performance across diverse and dynamic renewable energy infrastructures. This study investigates the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for predictive maintenance and optimization of renewable energy systems, with the aim of enhancing operational efficiency and extending system longevity. We employ a combination of machine learning algorithms, including deep neural networks and reinforcement learning, to develop predictive models and optimization strategies. These models are trained on large-scale datasets collected from operational wind farms, solar installations, and hydroelectric plants. Our results demonstrate that AI-driven approaches can predict equipment failures with 92% accuracy, reducing unplanned downtime by 35% compared to traditional methods. Moreover, AI-optimized operational parameters improved overall energy output by 8.5% across the studied systems. The proposed framework also showed adaptability to various environmental conditions and system configurations, suggesting broad applicability across the renewable energy sector. This research underscores the significant potential of AI in revolutionizing maintenance practices and operational strategies in renewable energy systems, paving the way for more reliable, efficient, and sustainable clean energy production."

      "abstract": "The application of wind power within smart grids is crucial thereby mandating integrative energy change. Yet, the randomness of wind and technological nature of wind turbines lead to quite a number of problems regarding the dependability and performance of supplied energy. These issues can be managed through the help of predictive maintenance which reduces the time that is taken in the machinery\u2019s periodic maintenance while at the same time reduces the cost of the overall maintenance. The following research work puts forward a framework for developing deep learning models to improve the approaches to maintain the wind energy systems using LSTM networks. The framework is based on the Wind Turbine SCADA Dataset which is a collection of time-series of various parameters of the turbine like wind speed, power output, rotor speed, temperature, and vibration and aims at predicting the probable equipment failures in future. The LSTM network used for the diagnosis of mechanical problems learns from the sensor data and watches for anomalies in real-time. Thus, owing to the organization of the maintenance activities according to such predictions, the framework minimizes the unexpected downtimes, and increases the lifespan of the turbine components, as well as the reliability of the energy production. In addition, the proposed business incorporates the predictive maintenance system into the smart grid system to facilitate energy management and the synchronization of the maintenance system with grid functionality. The research also responds to important issues: the fluctuation in the wind energy data and the adaptability of an LSTM model to large power stations."

      "abstract": "The integration of machine learning (ML) into wind energy systems holds significant promise for enhancing both predictive maintenance and operational efficiency. Wind energy, a cornerstone of renewable energy sources, faces challenges related to maintenance and efficiency, which can impede its reliability and cost-effectiveness. Traditional maintenance approaches often result in unexpected failures and downtimes, while optimizing turbine performance remains a complex task due to the variability of wind conditions. This paper explores the application of machine learning techniques to address these challenges. Predictive maintenance leverages ML algorithms to analyze historical and real-time data, identifying patterns and anomalies that precede component failures. Techniques such as supervised learning for failure prediction and unsupervised learning for anomaly detection enable timely interventions, reducing downtime and maintenance costs. Concurrently, ML models contribute to efficiency enhancement by optimizing turbine performance. These models predict power output based on environmental conditions and operational parameters, facilitating adaptive control systems that maximize energy capture and minimize wear and tear. Case studies demonstrate the practical implementation and benefits of these approaches. For instance, the application of time-series forecasting for condition monitoring has shown a significant reduction in unexpected failures, while optimization algorithms have improved turbine performance by adjusting operational parameters in real time. Despite the promising results, challenges such as data quality, model accuracy, and integration with existing systems persist. Looking forward, advancements in ML techniques, improved data collection methods, and the integration of emerging technologies like IoT and edge computing are expected to further enhance the capabilities of wind energy systems. This paper underscores the transformative potential of machine learning in creating more reliable, efficient, and cost-effective wind energy solutions, paving the way for a sustainable energy future. \nKeywords: Wind Energy Systems, Machine Learning, Predictive Maintenance, Efficiency Enhancement."

      "abstract": "Buildings consume around 40% of the total global energy consumption, while within the building, the HVAC systems are the most energy-hungry systems responsible for more than half of the total building\u2019s energy consumption. In addition, the most challenging task for facility managers is the maintenance of the HVAC system. Since the HVAC system is one of the necessities in modern buildings to maintain a comfortable and healthy environment. This is necessary to ensure proper maintenance of the HVAC system, specifically the faults detection and diagnostic to avoid system downtime and energy wastage and to enhance the HVAC system\u2019s lifespan. In this research work, we proposed a data-driven fault detection framework for predictive maintenance in HVAC systems of modern buildings using machine learning. In specific, the proposed data-driven framework is implemented using 8 different machine learning techniques for accurate fault detection, and their performance is evaluated using 4 different metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score. Extra Tree, Random Forest, and CatBoost classifiers outperformed the rest of the machine-learning techniques in all evaluation metrics. Further, the comparison of best-performer machine learning models is performed for each fault category detection. CatBoost and Random Forest are found more efficient in comparison to Extra Tree when evaluated for individual faults detection. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed machine learning- based data-driven framework for fault detection in HVAC systems."

This proactive approach not only minimizes downtime but also extends the lifespan of renewable energy infrastructure, resulting in substantial cost savings and improved reliability. Furthermore, AI plays a pivotal role in optimizing the energy output of renewable sources. Through advanced data analytics and real-time monitoring, AI algorithms can adapt to changing environmental conditions, predicting energy production patterns and optimizing resource allocation. This ensures maximum energy yield from renewable sources, making them more competitive with traditional energy sources. The paper delves into specific AI techniques such as deep learning, neural networks, and predictive analytics employed for predictive maintenance and energy optimization in various renewable energy systems like solar, wind, and hydropower. Challenges and opportunities associated with implementing AI in renewable energy are discussed, including data security, interoperability, and the need for standardized frameworks. The synthesis of AI technologies with renewable energy not only addresses operational challenges but also contributes to the global transition towards sustainable and clean energy solutions. This review serves as a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers seeking insights into the evolving landscape of AI applications in the renewable energy sector. As technology continues to advance, the synergies between AI and renewable energy are poised to shape the future of the global energy paradigm."

      "abstract": "Air compressors are widely used in industrial fields. Compressed air systems aggregate air flows and then supply them to places of demand. These huge systems consume a significant amount of energy and generate heat internally. Machine components in compressed air systems are vulnerable to heat, and, in particular, a radiator to cool the heat of the overall air compressor is the core component. Dirty radiators increase energy consumption due to anomalous cooling. To reduce the energy consumption of air compressors, this mechanism emphasizes a machine learning-based radiator fault detection, using features such as RPM, motor power, outlet pressure, air flow, water pump power, and outlet temperature with slight true fault labels. Moreover, the proposed system adds an LSTM-based motor power prediction model to point out the initial judgment of radiator fault possibility. Via the rigorous analysis and the comparison among machine learning models, this meticulous approach improves the performance of radiator fault prediction up to 93.0%, and decreases the mean power consumption of the air compressor around 2.24%."

      "abstract": "Predictive maintenance (PdM) in industrial systems seeks to forecast equipment failures before they occur, thereby reducing unplanned downtime, maintenance costs, and safety risks. Leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques\u2014such as decision trees, support vector machines (SVMs), random forests, and artificial neural networks (ANNs)\u2014enables the analysis of vast sensor\u2011generated datasets for early fault detection and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. This manuscript presents a comprehensive framework for applying ML to PdM within manufacturing and energy sectors, focusing on data acquisition, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. We compare classical ML methods (Random Forest, SVM, ANN) against deep learning approaches (Long Short\u2011Term Memory networks, CNN\u2011based classifiers) using a benchmark rolling bearing dataset. A detailed statistical analysis, including one table of performance metrics, demonstrates that deep learning methods can achieve up to 92% classification accuracy and an F1\u2011score of 0.90, surpassing classical techniques in both predictive accuracy and robustness to noisy data. We also explore dimensionality reduction via principal component analysis (PCA) to balance computational efficiency and model performance. Finally, we discuss scope and limitations\u2014highlighting data quality concerns, sensor heterogeneity, and computational costs\u2014and offer practical guidelines for implementing PdM solutions with technologies available up to 2022. The findings underscore ML\u2011driven strategies\u2019 potential to transform maintenance practices, improve operational reliability, and inform best practices for engineering deployment. In addition to demonstrating superior classification performance, this study provides a clear roadmap for practitioners selecting and tuning ML pipelines under real\u2011world constraints such as limited labeled data, variable operating environments, and heterogeneous sensor platforms. We delve into the practicalities of deploying ML models on edge devices versus centralized cloud infrastructure, examining trade\u2011offs in latency, throughput, and model update cycles. We also outline strategies for incremental learning to accommodate evolving fault modes without full retraining. By anchoring all techniques to peer\u2011reviewed studies and industrial case examples through 2022, this work ensures relevance for engineers and decision-makers tasked with modernizing maintenance operations in sectors ranging from automotive assembly to power plant management."

      "abstract": "Solar photovoltaic (SPV) arrays are crucial components of clean and sustainable energy infrastructure. However, SPV panels are susceptible to thermal degradation defects that can impact their performance, thereby necessitating timely and accurate fault detection to maintain optimal energy generation. The considered case study focuses on an intelligent fault detection and diagnosis (IFDD) system for the analysis of radiometric infrared thermography (IRT) of SPV arrays in a predictive maintenance setting, enabling remote inspection and diagnostic monitoring of the SPV power plant sites. The proposed IFDD system employs a custom-developed deep learning approach which relies on convolutional neural networks for effective multiclass classification of defect types. The diagnosis of SPV panels is a challenging task for issues such as IRT data scarcity, defect-patterns\u2019 complexity, and low thermal image acquisition quality due to noise and calibration issues. Hence, this research carefully prepares a customized high-quality but severely imbalanced six-class thermographic radiometric dataset of SPV panels. With respect to previous approaches, numerical temperature values in floating-point are used to train and validate the predictive models. The trained models display high accuracy for efficient thermal anomaly diagnosis. Finally, to create a trust in the IFDD system, the process underlying the classification model is investigated with perceptive explainability, for portraying the most discriminant image features, and mathematical-structure-based interpretability, to achieve multiclass feature clustering."

This paper explores the application of IoT-enabled real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance in solar systems, offering a novel solution to enhance system performance and minimize operational downtime. By leveraging IoT devices and advanced analytics, solar energy systems can now be continuously monitored for any signs of wear or failure. This proactive approach allows for the early detection of potential issues, enabling timely maintenance and repairs before they escalate into significant problems that could lead to system downtime or reduced efficiency.

It highlights the importance of predictive analytics in forecasting potential failures and scheduling maintenance activities, thereby extending the lifespan of the solar installation and ensuring it operates at peak efficiency. The integration of IoT technology not only improves the resilience of solar systems against physical and operational challenges but also contributes to a more stable and reliable grid by facilitating efficient energy storage and distribution. Furthermore, the economic implications of adopting IoT-enabled monitoring and predictive maintenance are examined. The analysis reveals that, despite initial setup and operational costs, the long-term benefits, including reduced maintenance costs, increased energy yield, and enhanced system reliability, present a compelling case for the integration of IoT technologies in solar energy systems. This paper concludes by addressing the potential challenges and considerations in implementing IoT solutions, such as cybersecurity risks and the need for technical expertise. It also outlines future directions for research and development, emphasizing the role of IoT in advancing the solar energy sector towards more sustainable and resilient energy solutions."

Even though many fault diagnosis methods have been proposed, a major challenge remains the lack of accurate predictive maintenance routines for utility-scale PV systems. The scope of this work is to address this fundamental challenge by proposing a data-driven predictive maintenance alerting routine (that leverages digital twin technologies and decision rules) for detecting and predicting PV system faults. The results demonstrated that the developed predictive maintenance routine yielded a sensitivity of 93.9% for PV utility-scale failure detection over a yearly test period. The findings of the predictive maintenance alerting model proved its capability to anticipate faults up to 10 days in advance, achieving a sensitivity of 83.3%. Finally, the predictive maintenance alerting system can be used by operation and maintenance teams for scheduling corrective actions and optimizing field activities."

      "abstract": "The growing complexity and critical importance of energy infrastructure necessitate the adoption of advanced maintenance strategies to ensure reliability, efficiency, and sustainability. Traditional maintenance approaches, such as reactive and preventive maintenance, have proven inadequate in addressing the challenges posed by modern energy systems, particularly with the integration of renewable energy sources. This research explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven predictive maintenance (PdM) as a transformative solution for the energy sector. By leveraging historical maintenance records and real-time sensor data, AI models, including machine learning and deep learning techniques, were developed to predict equipment failures with high accuracy. The study employed a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of data and qualitative insights from case studies conducted in wind farms, solar power plants, and thermal power plants. The results demonstrated that AI-driven PdM significantly reduces unplanned downtime, lowers maintenance costs, and extends the lifespan of critical energy assets. Deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), outperformed traditional models in terms of predictive accuracy, with F1-scores exceeding 90%. Despite the promising results, the research also identified challenges related to data quality, system integration, and organizational adoption. These challenges highlight the need for further research in areas such as explainable AI, the integration of IoT and digital twins, and the exploration of PdM applications across different sectors. The findings underscore the potential of AI-driven PdM to revolutionize maintenance practices in the energy sector, offering a pathway to more reliable, efficient, and sustainable energy systems."

      "abstract": "The reliability and efficiency of the electrical grid network are obtained through proper maintenance of the power transformers. The advanced maintenance of the electrical grid is obtained through modern strategies to enhance the performance of the system. Power transformers are an important part of the electrical distribution systems. Failure of transformers leads to various constraints regarding service interferences with costly outrages. Traditional forms of maintenance rely on manual inspections on fixed timelines which is not able to detect the transformer degradation at early stages. Advanced predictive maintenance with energy management is obtained through deep learning techniques with hybrid optimization techniques. This includes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This is done through various sensors and monitoring equipment placed in the distribution network. The extraction of spatial and temporal data from images is obtained through the CNN component. The hidden defects and abnormal functioning of various parts in the transformer are detected through CNN. Oil leakages, overheating and insulation failure are the early signs of transformer failures. The RNN component concentrates on the data generated by sensors and meters in real-time environment. This helps to predict the future demand for power transformers. The sequential patterns are obtained through the LS TM component. They provide accurate details regarding the performance and life of transformers. The integration of energy management with predictive maintenance helps optimise power utility while maintaining the reliable operation of transformers."

Technological advances like ADAS and AI in cars present societal challenges and opportunities. It shows how AI aids human-machine communication by improving motor skills. The auto industry is interested in ADAS because it can increase energy efficiency, safety, and comfort. Numerous studies have shown its benefits. ADAS and vehicle networking show promise, but establishing a sound control system is challenging. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is one answer to these problems. To manage higher-level connectivity and automation, the paper analyses and implements key research. It also finds issues and recommends solutions. The latest driverless car ADAS improvements have dramatically increased passenger safety. These systems are safer and more automated using sensors and ECUs. Most ADAS have RADAR, cameras, ultrasonic, and LiDAR. This work uses AI/ML-enabled Predictive Maintenance modelling to improve ADAS safety and longevity. AI and ML in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are significant vehicle safety and reliability advances. AI/ML-enabled predictive maintenance detects and fixes ADAS component faults. ADAS predictive maintenance using AI/ML can detect issues, improve driver safety, and boost vehicle efficiency. Advanced sensor arrays and control units are needed for adaptive cruise control, traffic sign recognition, and lane-keeping assistance. AI/ML algorithms discover issues and enable early interventions in predictive maintenance models. Predictive maintenance is examined utilizing classical machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning.

      "abstract": "Battery management systems (BMS) are essential in the fast developing IIoT domain for guaranteeing the efficiency, lifetime, and dependability of energy storage solutions. With the proliferation of IIoT devices across many industries, there is a growing need for sophisticated BMS systems that can optimise energy usage, anticipate battery performance, and enable intelligent maintenance. Improvements in energy efficiency, predictive analytics, and intelligent maintenance approaches are the primary foci of this research as it pertains to the IIoT ecosystem and BMS. Our first step is to investigate ways that IIoT devices can be made more energy efficient. This includes things like optimising the charging and discharging operations of batteries and using adaptive power management techniques. We want to keep IIoT devices running longer and lessen their impact on the environment by making the most of BMS\u2019s energy efficiency. Our second topic is the function of predictive analytics in predicting the state of a battery\u2019s health and output. Models are created using machine learning algorithms and big data analytics to forecast battery deterioration patterns, identify impending failures, and plan proactive maintenance to reduce maintenance expenses and downtime. We conclude by exploring intelligent maintenance approaches that can deliver BMS valuable insights through the use of real-time data and advanced analytics. A combination of these methods\u2014which include automated maintenance procedures, remote monitoring, and self-diagnostic devices\u2014improves the performance and dependability of IIoT battery systems. This paper examines the present and future of BMS in the IIoT through a thorough literature analysis, case studies, and experimental validation. The insights it provides are quite significant. In light of these results, data-driven methods have the ability to transform battery management, guaranteeing that IIoT devices can continue to withstand the increasing demands of industry while being environmentally friendly, efficient, and robust."

The technique evaluates and monitors the performance and degradation of PV panel by processing comprehensive input data such as voltage, current, irradiance, temperature, power, solar PV systems related data and PV panel parameter data. The Box Plot model efficiently monitors fault analysis and degradation detection, adapting to various operational conditions with accuracy, resulting in a powerful tool for assessing the reliability and performance of solar PV systems. The Box Plot model is tested by using the three sets of the solar PV power plant collected data from the PV panel strings in the same array that nearby each other and verifying the Box Plot model effectiveness by comparing the model analysis result with the solar PV power plant operation and maintenance report. This methodology makes a major contribution to predictive maintenance operations and ensuring more reliability for the PV systems."

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Predictive Maintenance (PdM) solutions can predict and consequently minimize downtimes. Concerning high implementation cost of PdM solutions for manufacturing systems as well as for sold systems operating in the field, e.g. Building Energy Systems in residential heating (RH), it is unclear under which conditions potentials outweigh investment. In a previous scientific publication, the authors proposed a methodology to systematically assess potentials and benefits of to-be-developed PdM solutions in manufacturing processes. The utilization of the methodology for RH systems is promising, but requires a suitable adaptation to its individual context. Apart from quantifying the benefit compared to investment for PdM solutions, the context of RH is fundamentally different from manufacturing. As a major difference, the systems are not located in-house, but in the field at the customers\u2019 site. This leads to increased challenges in terms of lacking customer and system feedback and data availability. Therefore, this paper addresses the optimization, transfer, and adaptation of the previously developed methodology to RH systems. Additionally, this paper includes baseline information regarding maintenance and RH and an exemplary application of the optimized and adapted methodology that supports the reliability department of BOSCH Thermotechnology for quantifying the potentials of PdM solutions in the field of RH."

      "abstract": "Nowadays, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) plays a more and more significant role in smart manufacturing. Predictive Maintenance (PdM) is one of the essential applications, recognizing the current status of the machine and preventing disastrous breakdowns. End-point sensors for such monitoring systems are powered mainly by batteries. As IIoT grows, constantly replacing batteries across thousands of devices is cost-prohibitive. In addition, tremendous original sensing data are wirelessly transmitted to the server for data analysis, causing colossal energy consumption. In this paper, we propose the first self-powered on-device PdM system based on piezoelectric energy harvesting and tiny machine learning (Tiny ML). A trained TinyML model is deployed on the low-cost microcontroller (MCU) for on-device inferring; only the diagnosis result is transmitted. With an emphasis on ultra-low-power demands, a piezoelectric energy harvester is utilized as an energy source and self-powered sensor (SPS) simultaneously. The energy-aware circuit provides reconfigurable on/off threshold voltages for efficient and robust intermittent operation. The balance between energy supply and demand in the battery-free system has been achieved by a handy design. A rich SPS dataset has been collected in a simulated vibration environment and analyzed by five well-known machine-learning models. Random forest stands out given ultra-small data length and sampling rate with accuracy up to 99% for four-class similar vibration diagnosis. Lab test validates the feasibility and performance. As a cyber-electro-mechanical co-design, the system provides a promising solution to the ubiquitous artificial intelligence of things (AIoT)."

      "abstract": "Buildings\u2019 heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems account for significant global energy use. Proper maintenance can minimize their environmental footprint and enhance the quality of the indoor environment. The adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors integrated into HVAC systems has paved the way for predictive maintenance (PdM) grounded in real-time operational metrics. However, HVAC systems without such sensors cannot leverage the advantages of current data-driven PdM techniques. This work introduces a novel data-driven framework, the health prognostics classification with autoencoders (HPC-AE), designed specifically for PdM. It utilizes solely HVAC power consumption and outside temperature readings for its operations, both of which are readily obtainable. The primary objective of the HPC-AE framework is to facilitate PdM through a health prognostic approach. The HPC-AE framework utilizes an autoencoder for feature enrichment and then applies an artificial neural network to classify the daily health condition of an HVAC system. A multi-objective evaluation metric is employed to ensure optimal performance of the autoencoder within this framework. This metric evaluates the autoencoder\u2019s proficiency in reducing reconstruction discrepancies in standard data conditions and its capability to differentiate between standard and degraded data scenarios. The HPC-AE framework is validated in two HVAC fault scenarios, including a clogged air filter and air duct leakage. The experimental results show that compared to methods used in similar studies, HPC-AE exhibits a 5.7% and 2.1% increase in the F1 score for the clogged air filter and duct leakage scenarios."

      "abstract": "Dry power transformers are a critical component of microgrids, but their diagnostic can be challenging due to the various types of defects that can occur. This paper proposes several monitoring techniques to predict these defects and improve the diagnostic of dry power transformers in microgrids. One of the key features of this approach is the use of thermal image classification to detect the number of short circuits in the power transformer. The classification of thermal images is performed using the transfer learning method, which allows for the utilization of pre-trained models and the adaptation of them to the specific task at hand. This feature is integrated into a larger smart energy management system for microgrids, which aims to optimize the operation and maintenance of these systems. The proposed techniques have been tested and validated through experiments, and the results demonstrate their effectiveness in accurately predicting defects and improving the diagnostic of dry power transformers in microgrids."

      "abstract": "Power transformers are a fundamental component of the modern power distribution network. The fault-free operation of step-up and step-down transformers is of prime importance to the continuous supply of electrical energy to the consumers. To ensure such efficient operation, power distribution companies carry out routine maintenance of distribution transformers through preplanned schedules. The efficacy of such maintenance depends on a proper understanding of the transformer and its components and efficient prediction of faults in these components. There are several components whose condition can be studied to predict transformer failures and therefore the overall health of a transformer. These include transformer windings, insulations, transformer oil, core insulations, and ferromagnetic cores. This work develops a new, simplified fuzzy logic\u2013based method to predict the health of a transformer by taking into account the state of several individual components. Case studies are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the developed method."

      "abstract": "The widespread adoption of cyber-physical systems and other cutting-edge digital technology in manufacturing industry production facilities may motivate stakeholders to embrace the idea of Industry 4.0. Some industrial companies already have different sensors installed on their machines; however, without proper analysis, the data collected is not useful. This systematic review\u2019s main goal is to synthesize the existing evidence on the application of predictive maintenance (PdM) with visual aids and to identify the key knowledge gaps in areas including utilities, power generation, industry, and energy consumption. After a thorough search and evaluation for relevancy, 37 documents were identified. Moreover, we identified the visual analytics of PdM, including anomaly detection, planning/scheduling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). The findings revealed that anomaly detection was a major domain in PdM-related works. We conclude that most of the literature lacks depth in terms of an overall framework that combines data-driven and knowledge-driven techniques of PdM in the manufacturing industry. Some works that utilized both techniques indicated promising results, but there is insufficient research on involving maintenance personnel\u2019s feedback in the latter stage of PdM architecture. Thus, there are still pertinent issues that need to be investigated, and limitations that need to be overcome before PdM is deployed with minimal human involvement."
