While ensuring the safety performance of the MASs, the mechanism adaptively and dynamically adjusts the trigger threshold of every agent to achieve discontinuous communication by using only the current and latest sampled signals. According to the MASs communication mode and Bernoulli attack model, a security consensus control protocol is constructed, and a bilateral sampled\u2010interval Lyapunov functional (BSILF) method is introduced to obtain more sampling interval information and establish sufficient conditions for the leader\u2010following state error system to stabilize asymptotically under hybrid random cyber attacks. Meanwhile, under a large sampling interval, the controller gain and adaptive event\u2010triggered parameters are designed and obtained. The simulation of the tunnel diode circuit system shows that the SIRAETCM can reduce the number of communications between agents to improve bandwidth utilization, and the adopted safety cooperative control protocol can improve the safety and effectiveness of the MASs."

To begin with, for the follower agents with unknown inputs, through an interval observer, the estimations of unknown input (UI) and system state can be obtained asymptotically and simultaneously by a Luenberger-like state observer (LLSO) combining with a UIR. After this, a distributed control protocol (DCP) on formation tracking is proposed based on the UIR and the state estimation, which can compensate the UI successfully. Moreover, the time space is divided into three parts utilizing the transmission interruption caused by DoS attacks, and the gain of the controller is designed corresponding to three different DoS attack duration, respectively. With the help of some concept in switched system, it is demonstrated that the given formation pattern can be reached under the proposed DCP. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods, a vehicle cruise control system used as the simulation example is given."

      "abstract": "Due to their special characteristics, vehicle-based ad hoc networks (VANET) are susceptible to a number of security issues. Particularly when many vehicles are present within the RSU\u2019s coverage area, existing authentication methods struggle to ensure that the roadside unit (RSU) rapidly authenticates each vehicle\u2019s signature. A novel agent-based message verification method is consequently proposed. The proxy vehicle analyses the messages sent by other vehicles and sends the results of its analysis to the neighbouring RSU. The RSU verifies the output results from the proxy vehicle to reduce computational overhead. The proposed method has been shown to satisfy the message authentication security requirements under the discrete logarithm issue for the elliptic curve. Additionally, simulation results show that the suggested authentication method requires 76% less time to validate 3,000 messages than the conventional authentication method and can more effectively meet the VANET\u2019s requirements for message authentication."

      "abstract": "This paper studies secure consensus control for multi-agent systems subject to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The DoS attacks cause changes in topologies, which will destroy the channels of communication and result in network paralysis. Unlike the existing publications with Markov switching, this paper mainly studies the topological structure changes of the subsystem models after DoS attacks. To ensure the consensus of systems, this paper designs an event triggered to reduce the use of the controller and decrease the influence of channel breaks off caused by DoS attacks. On this basis, different Lyapunov functions are established in each period of attack. Then, stochastic and Lyapunov stable theory is used to form the consensus criteria. Moreover, Zeno behavior is excluded by theoretical analysis. Finally, the simulation experiment proves the effectiveness of the proposed protocol."

SNMP is supported by Open Platform Communication (OPC) and recent microcontrollers. Therefore, it can be used to integrate OPC and micro controllers. This paper aims to measure the SNMP performances such as data validity and latency during data communication. The SNMP protocol is implemented in the IoT sensor (MQ-6 gas sensor) integration system with the human-machine interface (HMI) via an OPC server. The MQ-6 sensor is integrated with the ESP32 micro controller as a tool for processing sensor data. The micro controller is then configured to become an SNMP Agent to communicate with the OPC Server, which acts as the SNMP Manager. Then, the OPC Server becomes the data center for several OPC Clients, including HMI and Prosys OPC Client as historians. The results show that the data was successfully sent and displayed on the HMI. The data transmitted using the SNMP protocol is validated with the data sent using a web-based protocol without SNMP. In testing duration for 30 minutes, the average latency was 17.7 ms without any data corruption or Request Time Out (RTO)."

      "abstract": "Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) gateways connected to the Internet are often based on conventional operating systems such as Linux and on conventional communication protocols such as HTTPS and therefore are valuable targets for malicious attackers. When compromised, a malicious IIoT gateway can interfere with data exchanged between IIoT devices and systems running on servers or the Cloud. The Gateway Integrity Checking Protocol (GIP), proposed in previous work, defines a gossip mechanism to collect data from sets of IIoT devices to respond to security challenges issued by an External Security Agent (ESA) to assess a gateways trustworthiness. GIP relies on a secure channel between IIoT devices and the ESA, which is achieved using a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for message authentication and encryption. In this paper we perform an analysis of the security measures employed by GIP, using formal descriptions to demonstrate that GIP is no less secure than the hash algorithm and the public key infrastructure used. Additionally, we simulate different configurations of GIP to measure detection rate and time to detect integrity faults."

Terminal devices in the system need to register their information in the IoT management center in order to obtain the identity and key of the terminal devices.

      "abstract": "This paper introduces an event-triggered secure control scheme for human-in-the-loop multi-agent systems in the context of DoS attacks. The integration of human intelligence and decision-making significantly enhances system security, as a human provides command signals to a non-autonomous leader agent. To determine unknown states, an adaptive neural state observer utilizes neural networks to approximate nonlinear functions, while a relative threshold-based event-triggered con-trol strategy is introduced to optimize communication resource usage. At the same time, a predictor is developed to monitor potential compromises in the edges of the multi-agent network to counteract attacks. Using Lyapunov analysis, it is shown that the proposed secure control protocol is capable of maintaining bounded closed-loop signals despite the occurrence of attacks. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated by the simulation results."

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) create an extensive fighting capability of the developed military forces. Particularly, these systems carrying confidential data are exposed to security attacks. By the wireless\u2019s nature within these networks, they become susceptible to different kinds of attacks, hence, it seems essential to design the appropriate safety mechanism in such networks. The sinkhole attack is one of the most dangerous and threatening attacks amongst types of attack in UAS. A malicious UAV exists in such a threat attacking as a black hole for absorbing all traffic in the network. Mainly, in a Flow-based protocol, the attacker considers the requests on the route, then, it replies to the target UAV such as high quality or the best route towards Gard station. The malicious UAV is able to only insert itself on one occasion between the nodes relating to each other (such as sink node and sensor node), and act for passing packets among them. In this study, the malicious attacks are detected and purged using two stages were. In the first stage, some principles and rules are used to detect black hole, gray hole, and sinkhole attacks. In the second stage, using a smart agent-based strategy negotiation procedure for three steps, a defense mechanism is designed to prevent these attacks. The smart agent is used by reliable neighbors via the negotiation procedure for three steps, hence, the traffic formed by the malicious UAV is not considered. The suggested protocol is called SAUAS. Here, the technique is assessed through extensive simulations performed in the NS-3 environment. Based on the simulation outcomes, it is indicated that the UAS network performance metrics are enhanced based on the packet delivery rate, detection rate, false-negative rate and false-positive rate."

      "abstract": "In-vehicle networks handle the communication among Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and sensors with a serial protocol called Controller Area Network (CAN), which takes advantage of a broadcast mechanism for transferring data. However, the lack of authentication and encryption in CAN bus might lead to the vehicle being compromised by an untrusted agent. Meanwhile, AI-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) introduced in the literature require a centralized cloud server to undertake the resource-consuming task of processing network data, which also occupies the bandwidth while transferring data from vehicles to the remote server. Moreover, many car manufacturers avoid sharing information with the remote server to prevent further exposure of vehicles\u2019 private data. We utilize Federated Learning (FL) as a suitable solution to previous challenges, where data is trained locally on the vehicle side, and partially trained models are sent to the server. Nevertheless, private training in-side the vehicle requires low memory utilization while achieving low latency and high performance compared to Centralized Learning (CL) approaches. In this study, we propose a practical privacy-preserving IDS (ImageFed) approach by employing federated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). To evaluate the robustness of ImageFed in real-world applications, we investigate two scenarios that may cause performance degradation in FL, such as non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) clients and scarcity of training data during the process. The resulting analysis proves the robustness of ImageFed while delivering an average 99.54% f1-score, 99.87% accuracy, and low detection latency."

      "abstract": "Mobile agent system is a satisfying solution for the implementation and maintenance of applications distributed over large-scale networks, this solution is very used in solving complex problems since they are autonomous, Intelligent, robust and faulttolerant. Mobile agents have the capacity to migrate from one node to another all over the network allowing reduction in communication costs. Although they possess all these advantages, using them in distributed environment increases the threat to mobile agent security and during their mobility they can face different types of attacks such as of attacks like Replay attack, man-in-the-middle attack, Cookie theft attack, Offline password guessing attack, Stolen-verifier attack. In this paper we investigate the security of distributed mobile agent system. We propose a solution based on a secure Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) protocol to ensure mutual authentication and protect the agent from different known attacks. The implementation of the proposed solution is obtained using Java Agent Development Framework (JADE). Also, Binary serialization is used to establish a flexible portability of the agent. Finally, we present security and performance analysis, for our solution to secure mobile agent in distributed systems."

As a revolutionary technology, blockchain has drawn the attention of academics and researchers. Cryptocurrencies have already effectively utilized BC technology. Many researchers have sought to implement this technique in different sectors, including the Internet of Things. To store and manage IoT data, we present in this paper a lightweight BC-based architecture with a modified raft algorithm-based consensus protocol. We designed a Device Agent that executes a novel registration procedure to connect IoT devices to the blockchain. We implemented the framework on Docker using the Go programming language. We have simulated the framework on a Linux environment hosted in the cloud. We have conducted a detailed performance analysis using a variety of measures. The results demonstrate that our suggested solution is suitable for facilitating the management of IoT data with increased security and privacy. In terms of throughput and block generation time, the results indicate that our solution might be 40% to 45% faster than the existing blockchain."

      "abstract": "Wireless Ad-hoc network is a dynamic network without any physical architecture in which each and every node participating in the network and may exit at any moment. Because of the nature of its simplicity and adaptability, a wireless network is widely employed in military communications, emergency communications, academic goals and mobile conferences. Due to the dynamic nature of the Adhoc network, it is prone to attacks. So, there are always security issues related to the wireless network because any node may enter into the network anytime or may leave anytime with authentication. So, there is always a chance that malicious node may enter into the network and hampers the communication system of the entire network. One among them is the black hole attack. The black hole affects the entire network with its malicious behaviour while checking out the communication path between source and destination. For connection, establishment RREQ message is transmitted from the source node and they will wait for RRRP. For each RREQ received, the black hole nodes send the source node fake RREP. The origin node responds to fake RREPs and sends their data by the path described in the fake RREP which ultimately may result in packet drop or alteration of the packets by black hole nodes. This research work designed a detection technique to avoid black hole attacks and improve network performance. In this work, an adaptive technique based on the AODV routing protocol is presented upon request. In this analysis, Some of the sender nodes are assigned a task of the agent that checks the incoming route reply message for the destination nodes and avoid malicious node in the network. The resulting analysis shows that packet delivery ratio had increased with detection technique as compared to without detection technique i.e. blackhole condition."

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has facilitated services without human intervention for a wide range of applications, including continuous remote patient monitoring (RPM). However, the complexity of RPM architectures, the size of data sets generated and limited power capacity of devices make RPM challenging. In this paper, we propose a tier-based End to End architecture for continuous patient monitoring that has a patient centric agent (PCA) as its center piece. The PCA manages a blockchain component to preserve privacy when data streaming from body area sensors needs to be stored securely. The PCA based architecture includes a lightweight communication protocol to enforce security of data through different segments of a continuous, real time patient monitoring architecture. The architecture includes the insertion of data into a personal blockchain to facilitate data sharing amongst healthcare professionals and integration into electronic health records while ensuring privacy is maintained. The blockchain is customized for RPM with modifications that include having the PCA select a Miner to reduce computational effort, enabling the PCA to manage multiple blockchains for the same patient, and the modification of each block with a prefix tree to minimize energy consumption and incorporate secure transaction payments. Simulation results demonstrate that security and privacy can be enhanced in RPM with the PCA based End to End architecture."

      "abstract": "At present, distributed secondary frequency regulation based on multi-agent system (MAS) has become the most commonly used secondary frequency regulation method, but this method also brings network security risks. Therefore, this paper proposes a false data injection attack (FDIA) detection algorithm based on active power difference. Based on this algorithm, an attack elimination factor is added to the proposed consistency protocol to eliminate false data injection attacks. Considering that the communication delay will affect the convergence rate of MAS system, the consistency protocol is optimized. In addition, this paper optimizes a cooperative frequency regulation strategy, and distinguishes the strategies according to different scenarios. According to the order of action, the strategy is divided into two levels and three levels. Finally, a simulation model is built to test the defense algorithm and control strategy. The simulation results show the effectiveness and superiority of FDIA defense algorithm and frequency control strategy."
