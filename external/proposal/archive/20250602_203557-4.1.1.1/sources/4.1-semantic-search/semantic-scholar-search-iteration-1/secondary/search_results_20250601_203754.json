      "abstract": "Cloud computing is recognized as a cost-effective paradigm in outsourcing, where infrastructure, platforms, and software can be offered as a service. However, problems related to privacy and security are still challenging, especially in mobile cloud systems. Cloud end users are now using mobile systems for applications that fall under the data intensive paradigm, such as skyline queries, streaming information relays, and crowdsourced disaster management. However, the above paradigm shift has opened new research directions in security, data interoperability, sustainable software development, and many other areas. With the advent of fifth generation cellular telephony (5G), cloud and edge computing are starting to merge seamlessly with mobile computing. The 5G radio access network offers some novel features, such as network slicing, and the possibility of operating nonpublic networks, for example, within a factory, but in this context it may be even more interesting that 5G natively supports mobile edge computing associated with each base station, and that the 5G core network effectively is a software defined networking supported cloud infrastructure. This special issue presents four research papers, which encompass practical approaches that advance research in all aspects of handling large amounts of data in a secure manner in the cloud, mobile nodes, and cloud-connected edge clusters such as in MANETs and wireless sensor networks. In the first paper, Bartuzi and Trokielewicz tackle the challenge of authentication in mobile devices1 through developing a biometric authentication methodology based on images of the human hand generated in multiple light spectra. The following three types of devices were used for recording the image data: (i) visible light\u2014a digital camera with predetermined sensor sensitivity, (ii) near-infrared\u2014a custom-built device such as the customized Logitech Quickcam Messenger used in the experiments presented in the paper, and (iii) thermal cameras. The features extracted from these images were then used in the experimental analysis for verification of the potential impact of fusing different types of data on the recognition and thus also authentication accuracies. Secure data processing, information transfer, and task execution require the optimization of mobile and cloud core resource utilization. Such optimization may include the power consumption, software optimization as well as wireless communication protocols, and remote access and deployment of the cloud services. Nawrocki et al. in their paper2 developed an agent-based adaptive system enabling the optimization of services on the mobile device, in which the context of the device\u2019s operation, including security aspects, is analyzed. They used machine learning (ML) algorithms for secure allocation of tasks in mobile and conventional cloud resources. The most interesting aspect of this model is the online learning procedures used in ML methods for real-time modification of the data training sets during the execution of the learning algorithm based on the collected knowledge. This makes their approach distinctly different from many other models, where the learning process is offline and must be updated in short time intervals in order to simulate a real-time process. Monitoring large-scale distributed networks with mobile nodes and end users has become really challenging in the era of Facebook, providing various e-services and rapid development of global trade systems. Detection of anomalies, malicious data, and information in such networks requires scalable systems with centralized databases for the verification of the generated alerts in order to confirm and then detect external attacks. On the other hand, personalization of the services offered to the users requires local monitoring and detection tools. The network end user may be redirected to a local fake webpage or service, and tricked into revealing sensitive information to the attacker. Liu et al. present a model,3 where mobile computing devices may detect nefarious websites in order to avoid compromise. The detection system is deployed on mobile terminals, edge nodes, and servers, and is based on convolutional neural networks. The authors show the efficiency of their model especially in the case of distributed local attacks. Low latency, ultra-high speed, and high reliability are the most important criteria in the optimization of the IoT connectivity for future smart grids and mobile networks. The fifth generation (5G) cellular networks may potentially solve those optimization problems through reduction of the number of connected sensors and other mobile devices keeping the optimal coverage with high security and reliability. Borgaonkar et al.,4 using a pedagogical example, describe how smart grid systems can achieve better security when using connected IoT devices by utilizing the security mechanisms offered by 5G technology, also enabling offloading to edge devices that are an integral part of 5G. The authors survey the state of the art in wireless communication security for smart grid applications, and identify IoT communication requirements in a low-voltage regulation smart grid use case. They go on to develop an associated threat model, and discuss how 5G security specifications come to bear on the use case. We believe that all of the papers presented in this section will serve as a reference for students, researchers, and engineers interested in or currently working in the evolving and interdisciplinary area of security-aware intelligent mobile systems. We hope that the readers will find new inspiration for their research. We are grateful to all the contributors of this section. We thank the authors for their time and efforts in the presentation of their recent research results. We also would like to express our sincere thanks to the reviewers, who have helped us to ensure the quality of this publication. Our special"

      "abstract": "In future wireless networks, an enormous number of heterogeneous devices will be connected, leading to a dramatic increase in data traffic. At the same time, future applications will have significantly higher requirements with respect to data rates, reliability, and latency. Conventional approaches, which aim at only improving the communication capabilities of wireless networks, will not be sufficient to satisfy the more demanding requirements arising in future. Hence, a paradigm shift is needed. While conventionally perceived as pure communication networks, wireless networks can provide not only communication resources, but also computation, caching, data collection, and even user resources. Such resources can be part of the network infrastructure and of the wirelessly connected devices and their users. This radically different view on wireless networks as networks of distributed connected resources calls for the development of new techniques that jointly consider and leverage different types of resources in order to improve the system performance. \n \nIn this thesis, we show that such new techniques that jointly consider and leverage different types of resources require context-aware decision making. This is due to the fact that first, resources need to be shared and secondly, trade-offs between different types of resources exist. Thirdly, the optimal resource allocation may depend not only on network conditions, but also on other node-related, user-related or externally given conditions, the so-called context. We provide an overview of context-aware decision making by discussing context awareness, architectures of decision making, and designs of decision agents. Designing a context-aware decision-making framework requires to formulate a context-aware system model. In particular, decision agents responsible for resource allocation need to be identified. These agents may be part of a centralized, decentralized or hierarchical architecture of decision making and a suitable architecture needs to be selected. Finally, designing decision agents requires to model and classify the problem to be solved and to develop an appropriate method according to which decision agents take decisions. We emphasize two designs relevant for context-aware decision making in wireless networks, namely, optimization-based approaches and machine-learning-based approaches, in the latter case specifically the framework of multi-armed bandits. \n \nMoreover, in this thesis, we study three candidate techniques for wireless networks that jointly consider and leverage different types of resources, namely, computation offloading in multi-hop wireless networks, caching at the edge of wireless networks, and mobile crowdsourcing. For each technique, we identify a fundamental problem requiring context-aware decision making, propose a novel framework for context-aware decision making, and solve the problem using the proposed framework. \n \nComputation offloading allows wirelessly connected devices to offload computation tasks to resource-rich servers. This may reduce the devices' task completion times and their energy consumption. Computation offloading hence trades computation resources off against communication resources. In this thesis, for the first time, we study computation offloading in multi-hop wireless networks, where wirelessly connected devices assist each other as relay nodes. We identify the fundamental problem of context-aware computation offloading for energy minimization in multi-hop wireless networks. We propose a novel model that takes into account channel conditions, computing capabilities of the devices, task characteristics, and battery constraints at relay nodes since the effect of computation offloading on the devices' energy consumption depends on these context factors. Based on this model, we take an optimization-based approach and formulate the considered problem as a multi-dimensional knapsack problem, which takes into account that offloading decisions in multi-hop networks are non-trivially coupled as communication resources of relay nodes need to be shared. Finally, we propose a novel context-aware greedy heuristic algorithm for computation offloading in multi-hop networks. Based on its centralized architecture of decision making, this algorithm enables a central entity to take offloading decisions using centrally collected context information. We show that despite its centralized architecture, the algorithm has a small communication overhead. Numerical results demonstrate that the offloading solution found by the proposed algorithm on average reduces the network energy consumption by 13% compared to the case when no computation offloading is used. Moreover, the proposed algorithm yields near-optimal results in the considered offloading scenarios, with a maximal deviation of less than 6% from the global optimum. \n \nCaching at the edge allows popular content to be cached close to mobile users in order to serve user requests locally, thus reducing backhaul and cellular traffic as well as the latency for the user. \nHence, caching at the edge exploits caching resources in order to save communication resources. In this thesis, we identify the fundamental problem of context-aware proactive caching for maximizing the number of cache hits under missing knowledge about content popularity. We introduce a new model for context-aware proactive caching that takes into account that different users may favor different content and that the users' preferences may depend on their contexts. Using a machine-learning-based approach based on contextual multi-armed bandits (contextual MAB), we propose a novel online learning algorithm for context-aware proactive caching. Based on its decentralized architecture of decision making, this algorithm enables the controller of a local cache to learn context-specific content popularity, which is typically not available a priori, online over time. The proposed algorithm takes the cache operator's objective into account by allowing for service differentiation. We analyze the computational complexity as well as the memory and communication requirements of the algorithm, and we show how the algorithm can be extended to practical requirements. Moreover, we derive a sublinear upper bound on the regret of the algorithm, which characterizes the learning speed and proves that the algorithm converges to the optimal cache content placement strategy. Simulations based on real data show that, depending on the cache size, the proposed algorithm achieves up to 27% more cache hits than the best algorithm taken from the literature. \n \nMobile crowdsourcing (MCS) allows task owners to outsource tasks via a mobile crowdsourcing platform (MCSP) to a set of workers. Hence, MCS exploits user resources for task solving. In this thesis, we identify the fundamental problem of context-aware worker selection for maximizing the worker performance in MCS under missing knowledge about expected worker performance. We present a novel model for context-aware worker selection in MCS that can cope with different task types and that explicitly allows worker performance to be a non-linear function of both task and worker context. Using a machine-learning-based approach based on contextual MABs, we propose a new context-aware hierarchical online learning algorithm for worker selection in MCS. Based on the proposed hierarchical architecture of decision making, this algorithm splits information collection and decision making among several entities. Local controllers (LCs) in the workers' mobile devices learn the workers' context-specific performances online over time. The MCSP centrally assigns workers to tasks based on a regular information exchange with the LCs. This novel approach solves two critical aspects. First, personal worker context is kept locally in the LCs, which reduces communication overhead and preserves the privacy of the workers, who may not want to share personal context with the MCSP. Secondly, the MCSP is enabled to select the most capable workers for each task based on what the LCs learn about their workers' context-specific performances, which are typically unknown a priori. We analyze the computational complexity and derive upper bounds on the local memory requirements of the algorithm and on the number of times the quality of each worker must be assessed. Moreover, we show that the more access to worker context is granted to the LCs the lower are the communication requirements of the proposed algorithm compared to an equivalent centralized approach. In addition, we derive a sublinear upper regret bound, which characterizes the learning speed and proves that the algorithm converges to the optimal worker selection strategy. Finally, we show in simulations based on synthetic and real data that, depending on the availability of workers, the proposed algorithm achieves an up to 49% higher cumulative worker performance than the best algorithm from the literature."

      "abstract": "The new paradigm of Edge Computing aims to bring resources for storage and computations closer to end devices, alleviating stress on core networks and enabling low-latency mobile applications. While Cloud Computing carries out processing in large centralized data centers, Edge Computing leverages smaller-scale resources\u2014 often termed cloudlets\u2014in the vicinity of users. Edge Computing is expected to support novel applications (e.g., mobile augmented reality) and the growing number of connected devices (e.g., from the domain of the Internet of Things). Today, however, we lack essential building blocks for the widespread public availability of Edge Computing, especially in urban environments. This thesis makes several contributions to the understanding, planning, deployment, and operation of Urban Edge Computing infrastructures. We start from a broad perspective by conducting a thorough analysis of the field of Edge Computing, systematizing use cases, discussing potential benefits, and analyzing the potential of Edge Computing for different types of applications. \nWe propose re-using existing physical infrastructures (cellular base stations, WiFi routers, and augmented street lamps) in an urban environment to provide computing resources by upgrading those infrastructures with cloudlets. On the basis of a real-world dataset containing the location of those infrastructures and mobility traces of two mobile applications, we conduct the first large-scale measurement study of urban cloudlet coverage with four different metrics for coverage. After having shown the viability of using those existing infrastructures in an urban environment, we make an algorithmic contribution to the problem of which locations to upgrade with cloudlets, given the heterogeneous nature (with regards to communication range, computing resources, and costs) of the underlying infrastructure. Our proposed solution operates locally on grid cells and is able to adapt to the desired tradeoff between the quality of service and costs for the deployment. Using a simulation experiment on the same mobility traces, we show the effectiveness of our strategy. \nExisting mechanisms for computation offloading typically achieve loose coupling between the client device and the computing resources by requiring prior transfers of heavyweight execution environments. In light of this deficiency, we propose the concept of store-based microservice onloading, embedded in a flexible runtime environment for Edge Computing. Our runtime environment operates on a microservice-level granularity and those services are made available in a repository\u2014the microservice store\u2014and, upon request from a client, transferred from the store to execution agents at the edge. Furthermore, our Edge Computing runtime is able to share running instances with multiple users and supports the seamless definition and execution of service chains through distributed message queues. Empirical measurements of the implemented approach showed up to 13 times reduction in the end-to-end latency and energy savings of up to 94 % for the mobile device. \nWe provide three contributions regarding strategies and adaptations of an Edge Computing system at runtime. Existing strategies for the placement of data and computation components are not adapted to the requirements of a heterogeneous (e.g., with regards to varying resources) edge environment. The placement of functional parts of an application is a core component of runtime decisions. This problem is computationally hard and has been insufficiently explored for service chains whose topologies are typical for Edge Computing environments (e.g., with regards to the location of data sources and sinks). To this end, we present two classes of heuristics that make the problem more tractable. We implement representatives for each class and show how they substantially reduce the time it takes to find a solution to the placement problem, while introducing only a small optimality gap. The placement of data (e.g., such captured by mobile devices) in Edge Computing should take into account the user\u2019s context and the possible intent of sharing this data. Especially in the case of overloaded networks, e.g., during large-scale events, edge infrastructure can be beneficial for data storage and local dissemination. To address this challenge, we propose vStore, a middleware that\u2014based on a set of rules\u2014decouples applications from pre-defined storage locations in the cloud. We report on results from a field study with a demonstration application, showing that we were able to reduce cloud storage in favor of proximate micro-storage at the edge. \nAs a final contribution, we explore the adaptation possibilities of microservices themselves. We suggest to make microservices adaptable in three dimensions: (i) in the algorithms they use to perform a certain task, (ii) in their parameters, and (iii) in auxiliary data that is required. These adaptations can be leveraged to trade a faster execution time for a decreased quality of the computation (e.g., by producing more inaccurate or partly wrong results). We argue that this is an important building block to be included in an Edge Computing system in view of both constrained resources and strict requirements on computation latencies. We conceptualize an adaptable microservice execution framework and define the problem of choosing the service variant, building upon the design of our previously introduced Edge Computing runtime environment. For a case study, we implement representative examples (e.g., in the field of computer vision and image processing) and outline the practical influence of the abovementioned tradeoff. \nIn conclusion, this dissertation systematically analyzes the field of Urban Edge Computing, thereby contributing to its general understanding. Our contributions provide several important building blocks for the realization of a public Edge Computing infrastructure in an urban environment."
