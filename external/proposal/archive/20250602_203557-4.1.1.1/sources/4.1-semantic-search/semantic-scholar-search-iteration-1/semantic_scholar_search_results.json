      "abstract": "Cloud computing is recognized as a cost-effective paradigm in outsourcing, where infrastructure, platforms, and software can be offered as a service. However, problems related to privacy and security are still challenging, especially in mobile cloud systems. Cloud end users are now using mobile systems for applications that fall under the data intensive paradigm, such as skyline queries, streaming information relays, and crowdsourced disaster management. However, the above paradigm shift has opened new research directions in security, data interoperability, sustainable software development, and many other areas. With the advent of fifth generation cellular telephony (5G), cloud and edge computing are starting to merge seamlessly with mobile computing. The 5G radio access network offers some novel features, such as network slicing, and the possibility of operating nonpublic networks, for example, within a factory, but in this context it may be even more interesting that 5G natively supports mobile edge computing associated with each base station, and that the 5G core network effectively is a software defined networking supported cloud infrastructure. This special issue presents four research papers, which encompass practical approaches that advance research in all aspects of handling large amounts of data in a secure manner in the cloud, mobile nodes, and cloud-connected edge clusters such as in MANETs and wireless sensor networks. In the first paper, Bartuzi and Trokielewicz tackle the challenge of authentication in mobile devices1 through developing a biometric authentication methodology based on images of the human hand generated in multiple light spectra. The following three types of devices were used for recording the image data: (i) visible light\u2014a digital camera with predetermined sensor sensitivity, (ii) near-infrared\u2014a custom-built device such as the customized Logitech Quickcam Messenger used in the experiments presented in the paper, and (iii) thermal cameras. The features extracted from these images were then used in the experimental analysis for verification of the potential impact of fusing different types of data on the recognition and thus also authentication accuracies. Secure data processing, information transfer, and task execution require the optimization of mobile and cloud core resource utilization. Such optimization may include the power consumption, software optimization as well as wireless communication protocols, and remote access and deployment of the cloud services. Nawrocki et al. in their paper2 developed an agent-based adaptive system enabling the optimization of services on the mobile device, in which the context of the device\u2019s operation, including security aspects, is analyzed. They used machine learning (ML) algorithms for secure allocation of tasks in mobile and conventional cloud resources. The most interesting aspect of this model is the online learning procedures used in ML methods for real-time modification of the data training sets during the execution of the learning algorithm based on the collected knowledge. This makes their approach distinctly different from many other models, where the learning process is offline and must be updated in short time intervals in order to simulate a real-time process. Monitoring large-scale distributed networks with mobile nodes and end users has become really challenging in the era of Facebook, providing various e-services and rapid development of global trade systems. Detection of anomalies, malicious data, and information in such networks requires scalable systems with centralized databases for the verification of the generated alerts in order to confirm and then detect external attacks. On the other hand, personalization of the services offered to the users requires local monitoring and detection tools. The network end user may be redirected to a local fake webpage or service, and tricked into revealing sensitive information to the attacker. Liu et al. present a model,3 where mobile computing devices may detect nefarious websites in order to avoid compromise. The detection system is deployed on mobile terminals, edge nodes, and servers, and is based on convolutional neural networks. The authors show the efficiency of their model especially in the case of distributed local attacks. Low latency, ultra-high speed, and high reliability are the most important criteria in the optimization of the IoT connectivity for future smart grids and mobile networks. The fifth generation (5G) cellular networks may potentially solve those optimization problems through reduction of the number of connected sensors and other mobile devices keeping the optimal coverage with high security and reliability. Borgaonkar et al.,4 using a pedagogical example, describe how smart grid systems can achieve better security when using connected IoT devices by utilizing the security mechanisms offered by 5G technology, also enabling offloading to edge devices that are an integral part of 5G. The authors survey the state of the art in wireless communication security for smart grid applications, and identify IoT communication requirements in a low-voltage regulation smart grid use case. They go on to develop an associated threat model, and discuss how 5G security specifications come to bear on the use case. We believe that all of the papers presented in this section will serve as a reference for students, researchers, and engineers interested in or currently working in the evolving and interdisciplinary area of security-aware intelligent mobile systems. We hope that the readers will find new inspiration for their research. We are grateful to all the contributors of this section. We thank the authors for their time and efforts in the presentation of their recent research results.

      "abstract": "In future wireless networks, an enormous number of heterogeneous devices will be connected, leading to a dramatic increase in data traffic. At the same time, future applications will have significantly higher requirements with respect to data rates, reliability, and latency. Conventional approaches, which aim at only improving the communication capabilities of wireless networks, will not be sufficient to satisfy the more demanding requirements arising in future. Hence, a paradigm shift is needed. While conventionally perceived as pure communication networks, wireless networks can provide not only communication resources, but also computation, caching, data collection, and even user resources. Such resources can be part of the network infrastructure and of the wirelessly connected devices and their users. This radically different view on wireless networks as networks of distributed connected resources calls for the development of new techniques that jointly consider and leverage different types of resources in order to improve the system performance. \n \nIn this thesis, we show that such new techniques that jointly consider and leverage different types of resources require context-aware decision making. This is due to the fact that first, resources need to be shared and secondly, trade-offs between different types of resources exist. Thirdly, the optimal resource allocation may depend not only on network conditions, but also on other node-related, user-related or externally given conditions, the so-called context. We provide an overview of context-aware decision making by discussing context awareness, architectures of decision making, and designs of decision agents. Designing a context-aware decision-making framework requires to formulate a context-aware system model. In particular, decision agents responsible for resource allocation need to be identified. These agents may be part of a centralized, decentralized or hierarchical architecture of decision making and a suitable architecture needs to be selected. Finally, designing decision agents requires to model and classify the problem to be solved and to develop an appropriate method according to which decision agents take decisions. We emphasize two designs relevant for context-aware decision making in wireless networks, namely, optimization-based approaches and machine-learning-based approaches, in the latter case specifically the framework of multi-armed bandits. \n \nMoreover, in this thesis, we study three candidate techniques for wireless networks that jointly consider and leverage different types of resources, namely, computation offloading in multi-hop wireless networks, caching at the edge of wireless networks, and mobile crowdsourcing. For each technique, we identify a fundamental problem requiring context-aware decision making, propose a novel framework for context-aware decision making, and solve the problem using the proposed framework. \n \nComputation offloading allows wirelessly connected devices to offload computation tasks to resource-rich servers. This may reduce the devices' task completion times and their energy consumption. Computation offloading hence trades computation resources off against communication resources. In this thesis, for the first time, we study computation offloading in multi-hop wireless networks, where wirelessly connected devices assist each other as relay nodes. We identify the fundamental problem of context-aware computation offloading for energy minimization in multi-hop wireless networks. We propose a novel model that takes into account channel conditions, computing capabilities of the devices, task characteristics, and battery constraints at relay nodes since the effect of computation offloading on the devices' energy consumption depends on these context factors. Based on this model, we take an optimization-based approach and formulate the considered problem as a multi-dimensional knapsack problem, which takes into account that offloading decisions in multi-hop networks are non-trivially coupled as communication resources of relay nodes need to be shared. Finally, we propose a novel context-aware greedy heuristic algorithm for computation offloading in multi-hop networks. Based on its centralized architecture of decision making, this algorithm enables a central entity to take offloading decisions using centrally collected context information. We show that despite its centralized architecture, the algorithm has a small communication overhead. Numerical results demonstrate that the offloading solution found by the proposed algorithm on average reduces the network energy consumption by 13% compared to the case when no computation offloading is used. Moreover, the proposed algorithm yields near-optimal results in the considered offloading scenarios, with a maximal deviation of less than 6% from the global optimum. \n \nCaching at the edge allows popular content to be cached close to mobile users in order to serve user requests locally, thus reducing backhaul and cellular traffic as well as the latency for the user. \nHence, caching at the edge exploits caching resources in order to save communication resources. In this thesis, we identify the fundamental problem of context-aware proactive caching for maximizing the number of cache hits under missing knowledge about content popularity. We introduce a new model for context-aware proactive caching that takes into account that different users may favor different content and that the users' preferences may depend on their contexts. Using a machine-learning-based approach based on contextual multi-armed bandits (contextual MAB), we propose a novel online learning algorithm for context-aware proactive caching. Based on its decentralized architecture of decision making, this algorithm enables the controller of a local cache to learn context-specific content popularity, which is typically not available a priori, online over time. The proposed algorithm takes the cache operator's objective into account by allowing for service differentiation. We analyze the computational complexity as well as the memory and communication requirements of the algorithm, and we show how the algorithm can be extended to practical requirements. Moreover, we derive a sublinear upper bound on the regret of the algorithm, which characterizes the learning speed and proves that the algorithm converges to the optimal cache content placement strategy. Simulations based on real data show that, depending on the cache size, the proposed algorithm achieves up to 27% more cache hits than the best algorithm taken from the literature. \n \nMobile crowdsourcing (MCS) allows task owners to outsource tasks via a mobile crowdsourcing platform (MCSP) to a set of workers. Hence, MCS exploits user resources for task solving. In this thesis, we identify the fundamental problem of context-aware worker selection for maximizing the worker performance in MCS under missing knowledge about expected worker performance. We present a novel model for context-aware worker selection in MCS that can cope with different task types and that explicitly allows worker performance to be a non-linear function of both task and worker context. Using a machine-learning-based approach based on contextual MABs, we propose a new context-aware hierarchical online learning algorithm for worker selection in MCS. Based on the proposed hierarchical architecture of decision making, this algorithm splits information collection and decision making among several entities. Local controllers (LCs) in the workers' mobile devices learn the workers' context-specific performances online over time. The MCSP centrally assigns workers to tasks based on a regular information exchange with the LCs. This novel approach solves two critical aspects. First, personal worker context is kept locally in the LCs, which reduces communication overhead and preserves the privacy of the workers, who may not want to share personal context with the MCSP. Secondly, the MCSP is enabled to select the most capable workers for each task based on what the LCs learn about their workers' context-specific performances, which are typically unknown a priori. We analyze the computational complexity and derive upper bounds on the local memory requirements of the algorithm and on the number of times the quality of each worker must be assessed. Moreover, we show that the more access to worker context is granted to the LCs the lower are the communication requirements of the proposed algorithm compared to an equivalent centralized approach. In addition, we derive a sublinear upper regret bound, which characterizes the learning speed and proves that the algorithm converges to the optimal worker selection strategy. Finally, we show in simulations based on synthetic and real data that, depending on the availability of workers, the proposed algorithm achieves an up to 49% higher cumulative worker performance than the best algorithm from the literature."

      "abstract": "The new paradigm of Edge Computing aims to bring resources for storage and computations closer to end devices, alleviating stress on core networks and enabling low-latency mobile applications. While Cloud Computing carries out processing in large centralized data centers, Edge Computing leverages smaller-scale resources\u2014 often termed cloudlets\u2014in the vicinity of users. Edge Computing is expected to support novel applications (e.g., mobile augmented reality) and the growing number of connected devices (e.g., from the domain of the Internet of Things). Today, however, we lack essential building blocks for the widespread public availability of Edge Computing, especially in urban environments. This thesis makes several contributions to the understanding, planning, deployment, and operation of Urban Edge Computing infrastructures. We start from a broad perspective by conducting a thorough analysis of the field of Edge Computing, systematizing use cases, discussing potential benefits, and analyzing the potential of Edge Computing for different types of applications. \nWe propose re-using existing physical infrastructures (cellular base stations, WiFi routers, and augmented street lamps) in an urban environment to provide computing resources by upgrading those infrastructures with cloudlets. On the basis of a real-world dataset containing the location of those infrastructures and mobility traces of two mobile applications, we conduct the first large-scale measurement study of urban cloudlet coverage with four different metrics for coverage. After having shown the viability of using those existing infrastructures in an urban environment, we make an algorithmic contribution to the problem of which locations to upgrade with cloudlets, given the heterogeneous nature (with regards to communication range, computing resources, and costs) of the underlying infrastructure. Our proposed solution operates locally on grid cells and is able to adapt to the desired tradeoff between the quality of service and costs for the deployment. Using a simulation experiment on the same mobility traces, we show the effectiveness of our strategy. \nExisting mechanisms for computation offloading typically achieve loose coupling between the client device and the computing resources by requiring prior transfers of heavyweight execution environments. In light of this deficiency, we propose the concept of store-based microservice onloading, embedded in a flexible runtime environment for Edge Computing. Our runtime environment operates on a microservice-level granularity and those services are made available in a repository\u2014the microservice store\u2014and, upon request from a client, transferred from the store to execution agents at the edge. Furthermore, our Edge Computing runtime is able to share running instances with multiple users and supports the seamless definition and execution of service chains through distributed message queues. Empirical measurements of the implemented approach showed up to 13 times reduction in the end-to-end latency and energy savings of up to 94 % for the mobile device. \nWe provide three contributions regarding strategies and adaptations of an Edge Computing system at runtime. Existing strategies for the placement of data and computation components are not adapted to the requirements of a heterogeneous (e.g., with regards to varying resources) edge environment. The placement of functional parts of an application is a core component of runtime decisions. This problem is computationally hard and has been insufficiently explored for service chains whose topologies are typical for Edge Computing environments (e.g., with regards to the location of data sources and sinks). To this end, we present two classes of heuristics that make the problem more tractable. We implement representatives for each class and show how they substantially reduce the time it takes to find a solution to the placement problem, while introducing only a small optimality gap. The placement of data (e.g., such captured by mobile devices) in Edge Computing should take into account the user\u2019s context and the possible intent of sharing this data. Especially in the case of overloaded networks, e.g., during large-scale events, edge infrastructure can be beneficial for data storage and local dissemination. To address this challenge, we propose vStore, a middleware that\u2014based on a set of rules\u2014decouples applications from pre-defined storage locations in the cloud. We report on results from a field study with a demonstration application, showing that we were able to reduce cloud storage in favor of proximate micro-storage at the edge. \nAs a final contribution, we explore the adaptation possibilities of microservices themselves. We suggest to make microservices adaptable in three dimensions: (i) in the algorithms they use to perform a certain task, (ii) in their parameters, and (iii) in auxiliary data that is required. These adaptations can be leveraged to trade a faster execution time for a decreased quality of the computation (e.g., by producing more inaccurate or partly wrong results). We argue that this is an important building block to be included in an Edge Computing system in view of both constrained resources and strict requirements on computation latencies. We conceptualize an adaptable microservice execution framework and define the problem of choosing the service variant, building upon the design of our previously introduced Edge Computing runtime environment. For a case study, we implement representative examples (e.g., in the field of computer vision and image processing) and outline the practical influence of the abovementioned tradeoff. \nIn conclusion, this dissertation systematically analyzes the field of Urban Edge Computing, thereby contributing to its general understanding. Our contributions provide several important building blocks for the realization of a public Edge Computing infrastructure in an urban environment."

Based on this, we take a systemic approach and determine leverage points that can be used to foster transformative change towards integrative conservation\u2010oriented forest management.\n\nWe conducted a survey of 1656 small\u2010scale private forest owners in northwest Germany within a typical European multi\u2010ownership landscape and formed three clusters based on their activities.\n\nWhile all groups generally perceived nature conservation as important, they differed with regard to their forest management activities. Multiple\u2010use\u2010oriented forest owners (45%) were most active, including in terms of conservation measures. Conservation\u2010oriented owners (25%) mainly focused on passive measures, and conventional owners (30%) showed only a little engagement with conservation\u2010related activities. Despite the differences, common instruments promoting conservation activities were identified. They included, for example on\u2010site consultation, information about legal regulations and financial incentives.\n\nBased on four system characteristics (parameters, feedback, design and intent), we identified leverage points towards transformative change. The deep and thus effective leverage points are changing the discourse, accounting for the heterogeneity of private forest owners as well as for uncertainty related to climate change and adapting measures to local contexts. Furthermore, working towards increasing awareness, knowledge and interest as well as accounting for the desire for autonomy and control are promising pathways for change.\n\nA holistic transformation of forest policy and management towards integrative conservation is urgently needed to meet the current challenges of climate change, biodiversity loss and timber demand. This transformation has to go beyond the adaptation of existing policy instruments and instead focus on systematic and cross\u2010sectoral changes in the underlying policy orientation, its design and its implementation.\n\nRead the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog."

      "abstract": "A general approach to the organization and cargo flows management in regional multimodal transport and technological systems is developed. It has the features of multiagent, if we consider participants in the transportation process as agents. In this work, these agents are the client (consignor, cargo owner), carrier, infrastructure owner, operator company (rolling stock owner), as well as the contractor for reconstruction of transport infrastructure facilities. The general methodological basis when setting the multi-criteria optimization problem (with temporary objective functions, in this case) are the main principles of egalitarianism and utilitarianism used in the welfare theory. In the developed optimization algorithm, along with transport components, the production component is also considered. In the optimization process, indicators which take into account the implementation of reconstruction work on the railway loop sections are used. The object of research is a part of the loop North-Caucasian Railway, which serves as a transport platform for a developed market of export grain transportation to the ports of the Azov-Black Sea basin. Computational procedures implementing the developed optimization algorithms are performed in the Maxima environment."

      "abstract": "Forest management at the landscape level is a requirement for reducing wildfire hazard. In contexts where non-industrial private forest ownership prevails, the collaboration among multiple owners has been proposed as the way forward to reach consistent fuel management at that level. The current literature has been focused on identifying the factors that lead to collaboration among owners. In this study we explored other ways to reach landscape-level management in addition to the collaborative way, such as those that may be promoted through land renting or selling. Different contexts and owner types may require different solutions. Thus, we explicitly asked which alternative would be chosen by a given forest owner, from the following set: keeping individual management, entering a multi-owner collaborative arrangement where they delegate management, renting to a pulp company; or selling the land. In a context of small-scale ownership and high recurrence of wildfires in Portugal, a face-to-face survey was carried out to a sample of landowners. Our results suggest that there is not an a priori generalized unwillingness of owners to delegate management, rent or sell the land and thus they seem prone to align themselves with policy strategies to promote management at the landscape level. Multinomial logit regression modelling allowed us to explain and predict owners\u2019 choices among the aforementioned set of alternative management options. We found that choosing multi-ownership collaboration, as opposed to keeping current individual management, is associated with passive management under harsher conditions, by non-residents without bonding capital. The identified factors of owners\u2019 choices show the limited scope of tenancy and land-market mechanisms to promote landscape-level management. The best policy option was found to depend on the owner profiles prevailing in the target area. This suggests that studying the existing context and owner types is required to design effective policies."

However, most existing solutions to this problem rely on trusted third parties and have complicated signature permission processes, resulting in additional overhead. Therefore, we propose a verifiable data-sharing scheme (VDS-DM) that can support dynamic multi-owner scenarios. We introduce a management entity that combines linear secret-sharing technology, multi-owner signature generation, and an aggregation technique to allow multi-owner file sharing. Without the help of trusted third parties, VDS-DM can update file signatures for dynamically changing file owners, which helps save communication overhead. Moreover, users independently verify the integrity of files without resorting to a third party. We analyze the security of VDS-DM through a security game. Finally, we conduct enough simulation experiments and the outcomes of experimental demonstrate the feasibility of VDS-DM."

      "abstract": "Nowadays, more and more people are engaged in media creation and sharing for income. A common way to earn income is to upload media to an intermediary platform and then let the platform distribute some profits. However, intermediary platforms generally not only extract most of the profits, but also lack transparency in their operation, where owners lose direct control over the media. Nevertheless, individual sharing is not feasible for owners because each owner holds too little media to attract enough users independently. Blockchain is a solution to the above problem by gathering media from multiple owners without intermediaries. Though a lot of works have studied the use of blockchain for decentralized management of media data, many of them either did not consider sharing needs or tracing the illegal redistribution by malicious users. As for other works, most of them adopted symmetric digital watermarking in their blockchain networks, and thus fail to protect the rights of users who may be framed by malicious owners. Although asymmetric watermarking has been used by two existing works, the owner-side embedding pattern results in low owner-side efficiency. In view of this, we design a media sharing blockchain network in which the asymmetric fingerprinting (i.e., watermarking) with user-side embedding is introduced. Besides superior owner-side efficiency, our scheme also outperforms the above two ones in terms of TTP-free. Moreover, our scheme is designed to offer a user-friendly experience and support record traceability. The performance of our scheme is verified by both theoretical and experimental evaluations."

      "abstract": "In the current situation where the ultra-aged society is becoming a reality, the sale-type senior housing, which was deleted from the Welfare of Senior Citizens Act in 2015, is being re-discussed. Unlike lease-type senior housing, where the ownership of the house belongs to the owner of the facility, sale-type senior housing are owned by the residents. This difference requires appropriate management that is suitable for the characteristics of the senior housing. \nHowever, the current senior housing operation standards under the Welfare of Senior Citizens Act are centered on lease-type senior housing, and are therefore not suitable for sale-type senior housing. Therefore, in order to protect the property rights of owners of sale-type senior housing, it is necessary to find a property management plan through the provisions of Multi-Family Housing management Act. \nSo this study points out the following problems. First, sale-type senior housing, who are the owners, cannot exercise the right to appoint or dismiss managers. Second, the management committee is comprised of the management entity, not the owners, so the voting rights of residents are limited. \nTherefore, in order to overcome the problems of the current Welfare of Senior Citizens Act, the provisions of Multi-Family Housing management Act on management systems are actively utilized to protect the property rights of owners of sale-type senior housing."

Using a unique database containing microdata on the founders of Spanish multi-owner firms from 1886 to 1936, this study analyses the role of female owners and the legal structures that supported their participation in business. In that 50-year period, over 10% of newly registered firms had at least one female owner. Of those owners, 70% were widows. The majority of those women had management responsibilities in their firm. Multi-owner firms with at least one female owner display marked differences, in terms of capital, number of partners, family ties, and management, from those run solely by men."

      "abstract": "The nineteenth century mass mammal extinctions in the semi-arid zone of the Murray\u2012Darling basin, southeastern Australia, are examined in the context of prior traditional land management. A model of grassland dynamics reveals a multi-trophic level productive pulse one to five years post-fire, followed by senescence and increasing flammability. Traditional Owner patch burning of grassland optimized human and mammalian food (including tubers, seeds and fungi) and decreased fire risk. Over at least 40 000 years, the persistence and abundance of fauna responded to this energetically closed self-reinforcing management. In 1830, depopulation (disease, massacres and displacement) effectively ended traditional management, an ecologically traumatic event that extinguished these productivity pulses. Associated mammal populations of c. 20 species collapsed, and all eco-engineering and mycophagous species, such as bilbies, bettongs and bandicoots, rapidly disappeared. Traditional land management increased productivity, habitat heterogeneity and reduced wildfire risk, underpinning mammal abundance. This has remained unrecognized by most mammalogists and land managers. Blaming extinctions predominantly on the additions by Europeans (introduction of ungulates, feral grazers and predators etc.), disastrous as they were, fails to acknowledge the initial cause of rarity, i.e. loss of productivity, habitat and niches when traditional management was subtracted from country. As ecosystems continue to degrade, understanding the primary cause is fundamental to improved management. Although too late for extinct species, respect for, and inclusion of, traditional land management knowledge provides a direction for future land management."

      "abstract": "Due to the rising trend in Distributed Energy Resource (DER) integration it is important to understand the impacts of DER in a multi area network. Transmission line utilization can be altered due to the DER penetration in adjacent areas. These impacts are not considered in traditional transmission planning studies. This paper investigates adjacent area DER impacts on transmission lines from a transmission owner perspective. In order to quantify the transmission line impacts a metric named Performance Index (PI) is developed. Due to the adjacent area DER penetration; over-utilization, under-utilization and no change in utilization of transmission lines were captured using this metric along with their probability of occurrence. The results showed that there can be significant impact on transmission lines in a non-DER area due to the adjacent area DERs. Economic analysis is carried out to capture the loss or benefit in line revenues due to the change in line utilization. The results from the economic analysis also showed that there can be significant impacts in line revenue recovery due to the adjacent area DERs."

      "abstract": "Cloud computing is considered as the cost-efficient and practical resolution for group data sharing within the cloud group members. Unluckily, distributing data in a multi- owner way and defending data with unique privacy in cloud is a challenging issue because of the repeated change or deletion of the members. The proposed multi-owner group management system uses novel scheme GCAURDL-FBS( Group Creation, Add Member, Revocation, Deletion, Login with Forward & Backward Secrecy) to control overall group management. GCAURDL-FBS using SDBAES (Secure Dynamic Bits Advance Encryption Standard) secures the group data sharing. The major objectives of this research is 1) data security, 2) data integrity, 3) data sharing without using secret key re-computation / re-encryption, 4) forward and backward secrecy, 5) proper group owner / member revocation and 6) avoiding collusion attack, brute force attack and Structured Query Language Injection attack. Any member in group can confidently impart their information through entrusted server. Owner / Member revocation is achieved by a novel scheme; it is not necessary to compute/alter the secret keys of other members. The proposed scheme supports data integrity and efficient group member/owner revocation. Ultimately, it is found that, proposed scheme is also secure, scalable and efficient in relative to the relevant schemes. This is revealed in the security and tentative analysis\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0"

      "abstract": "The Swedish risk management case of Baltic fatty fishes, in which dioxin levels may be too high, is a typical multidimensional food safety decision problem involving public health, economic, environmental and socio-cultural aspects. To effectively address the dioxin food safety problem, the multiple dimensions and conflicting interests of stakeholders have to be considered systematically when evaluating competing risk management options. The objectives of this study were to illustrate the applicability of the Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) method for multidimensional food safety risk management problems, and to evaluate the Swedish dioxin risk management using MCDA. The results show that the MCDA method is indeed a relevant tool for modelling the multifactorial Swedish dioxin problem and for initiating discussions amongst stakeholders to increase the acceptance of chosen strategies. Abolishing the derogation from the European Commission\u2019s maximum limits for the presence of dioxins in Swedish fish is the dominant strategy for risk assessors, whereas the preferences provided by the other stakeholders would suggest a continuation of the derogation without providing consumer information. However, the preferences of female consumers match with the 2011 decision of the Swedish government to ask for a derogation in combination with consumer information. The conclusion drawn from our MCDA analysis is comparable to the government\u2019s decision that\u2014given the gradual reduction in dioxin concentrations in Baltic fish\u2014the decision to continue providing consumer information or not mainly depends on how risk managers balance the preferences of the different stakeholders."

      "abstract": "Multi-microgrids (MMGs) revolutionize integrating and managing diverse distributed energy resources (DERs), significantly enhancing the overall efficiency of energy systems. Unlike traditional power systems, MMGs comprise interconnected microgrids that operate independently or collaboratively. This innovative concept adeptly addresses challenges posed by pulsed load effects, capitalizing on the cooperative nature of interconnected microgrids. A coordinated MMG system effectively redistributes and shares the impact of pulsed loads, mitigating voltage fluctuations and ensuring sustained system stability. The proposed cooperative MMG scheme optimizes power distribution and load prioritization, facilitating the seamless allocation of surplus energy from neighboring microgrids to meet sudden surges in demand. This study focuses on DC standalone multi-microgrid systems, showcasing their inherent adaptability, resilience, and operational efficiency in managing pulse, variable, and unpredictable generation deficits. Several experiments on a laboratory-scale DC multi-microgrid validate the system\u2019s robust performance. Notably, transient current fluctuations during pulse loads are promptly stabilized through the effective collaboration of microgrids. Variable load experiments reveal distinct behaviors, shedding light on the profound influence of control strategies. This research reveals the transformative potential of MMGs in addressing energy challenges, with a particular focus on DC standalone multi-microgrid systems. The findings underscore the adaptability and resilience of the proposed cooperative scheme, marking a significant stride in the evolution of modern power systems."

      "abstract": "Bridge agencies are often challenged to develop maintenance programs under given budgets. Numerous studies developed budget-allocation models for maintenance programs during defined planning horizons of multiple fiscal years while totally ignoring the crucial aspect of cash flow. The payment schedules (both timing and amount) for contractors might indicate agencies\u2019 cash needs that exceed the available budgets during certain fiscal years, which create cash flow problems. While numerous finance-based scheduling (FBS) models were developed to manage cash flow for contractors, this function was totally overlooked for portfolio owners. Thus, this research reintroduces the FBS from the perspective of portfolio owners. A FBS model is developed to schedule the activities of the portfolio projects, utilize the schedules to define the payment schedules of projects\u2019 contractors, calculate the agencies\u2019 cash needs during the fiscal years, and utilize the multi-objective optimization algorithms of NSGA-II, SPEA-II, and MOPSO to optimize the projects\u2019 schedules to achieve a balance between the cash needs during the fiscal years and the available budgets. The anticipated extensions in projects\u2019 completion represent the conflicting objectives. Finally, the optimized schedules make the contractors\u2019 payment schedules affordable by the agencies\u2019 budgets, which help to complete projects successfully and achieve the programs\u2019 strategic goals."

      "abstract": "PurposeThis paper offers a theoretical explanation to a positive story of a micro enterprise found in Uganda, an African developing country that has successfully managed workplace relationships, its survival and good performance. Specifically, the paper examines multiple theories to explain the practice in this enterprise.Design/methodology/approachThe study uses storytelling, a form of narrative inquiry embedded in qualitative methodology. Based on in-depth interviews with the owner-manager and employees, a story was developed detailing their practical experience while focusing on the context, actions, results and lessons.FindingsFindings reveal that micro enterprises that allow free generation of ideas across all levels with optimistic people who reciprocate and work together, create a friendly work atmosphere with support for one another, amicably resolve conflicts and build trust. More so, several theories that include: Social Exchange Theory, Relational Cohesion Theory, Complex Adaptive Systems Theory and Cultural Historical Activity Theory, explain the manifestations of relational people management in micro enterprises.Originality/valueThis paper is unique in its use of a positive story showing a practical experience of how workplace relationships are managed in a micro enterprise found in Uganda, an African developing country. In addition, a multi-theoretical perspective is used to explain the manifestations in the story which may be novel in the study context. Thus, a conceptual model is proposed depicting generalized reciprocity, positive emotions, generative leadership and relational agency as antecedents of relational people management with relational agency again mediating the other relationships."

      "abstract": "Massive penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) along with limitations of the network are increasingly causing congestion or voltage problems in transmission and distribution systems. The interconnectedness of these systems necessitates coordination amongst their operators to assure supply security. This paper proposes a methodology for coordination amongst a Transmission System Operator (TSO) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs) without any hierarchy imposed on the entities. Coordination enables optimal usage of flexibility from Active Distribution Systems (ADSs) by the TSO and mitigation of congestion and voltage problems. This work leverages a two-level Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), which guarantees convergence to an approximate stationary solution for multi-block problems involving multiple actors. Tested on a modified IEEE 118-bus transmission system coupled with IEEE 33-bus active distribution test systems, the benefits of the proposal are demonstrated."

      "abstract": "The decreasing costs of photovoltaic (PV) systems and battery storage, alongside the rapid rise of electric vehicles (EVs), present a unique opportunity to revolutionize energy use in apartment complexes. Electricity generation using PV and battery systems is currently more cost-effective and environmen-tally friendly than grid power which is often expensive. However, access to fast EV charging infrastructure remains limited in multi-building apartment complexes. To this end, this paper proposed a business model for deploying commercial PV-powered battery storage and EV fast chargers within apartment complexes in Orlando, Florida, operated by complex owners. By modeling the complex as a grid-connected microgrid, it aims to meet resi-dents' energy needs, provide backup power during emergencies, and introduce a profitable business model for property owners. To address PV power uncertainty, a distributionally robust chance-constrained optimization method using the Wasserstein metric is employed, ensuring robust and reliable operation. The techno-economic analysis reveals that EVs powered by PV and batteries are more cost-effective and environmentally friendly than gasoline vehicles and EV owners can save up to $100 per month by saving on fuel costs. The results also show that integrating PV and battery systems reduces operational costs, lowers emissions, increases resilience, and supports EV adoption while offering monetary benefits for property owners. These findings highlight a practical and sustainable framework for advancing clean energy use in residential complexes."

      "abstract": "This paper explores the possibility of implementing distributed optimization through peer-to-peer energy (P2P) trading platform while keeping the temperature of batteries in electric vehicles below the safe threshold. While most thermal management schemes consider a battery as a point to simplify the computation, this work proposes to model and regulate the battery\u2019s temperature profile over its cells. This more granular access to the battery\u2019s temperature allows for more effective management as the temperature distribution over cells is not homogeneous. As a result, a linear discrete-time model is derived for the cell-level temperature vector and incorporated into the P2P energy trading platform. A multi-period P2P policy is developed to maximize the EV\u2019s owner benefits while preventing battery cells\u2019 temperature from rising too high. Numerical results with a set of 15 agents which are a part of IEEE 33-bus radial distribution test feeder are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm on P2P trading and battery temperatures."

      "abstract": "Due to rapid socioeconomic growth and current environmental concerns, reducing global greenhouse gas emissions is a key step toward sustainable development. In recent years, some researchers have begun to adopt new grid management technologies such as virtual power plants (VPP) that allow them to improve energy management and cost and reduce gas emissions. The integration of distributed energy resources (DER), such as solar photovoltaic and wind power, combined with micro\u2010turbines and energy storage systems and with the support of VPP intelligence, will contribute immensely to improving micro\u2010grids (MGs) energy performance and reducing gas emissions. In this paper, an expert multi\u2010objective feasibility enhanced particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted for the optimal scheduling of energy management system to reduce the total operating cost and net emission simultaneously. The proposed algorithm is tested on an Algerian reel building\u2010MG integrated VPP with DERs and combined cooling, heat, and power generation. Finally, different cases are simulated for a 24\u2010h time and discussed to demonstrate the validity of the proposed VPP energy system and the effectiveness of the adopted algorithm to reduce gas emissions and the total operating cost."

      "abstract": "From a trade and administrative standpoint, a Smart Grid (SG) is emerging as a future power grid that will support a Smart Distribution System. Distribution Networks (DNs) profit economically from Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), notably renewable energy resources (RERs), and electrical policy deregulation. Distribution network planning, construction, operation, and administration have been reevaluated due to multiple-party integration, load management advances, smart appliances, and higher consumer expectations. Distribution automation issues arise from these methods. In this environment, issues include strategic bidding manoeuvres, energy exchange, effective planning and monitoring, and vital protective systems. Distribution networks (DNs) with non-dispatchable players like scattered producing units and consumers with changing loads increase trading and management challenges. This research presented unique smart grid system performance improvements to overcome the limitations of existing smart grid management strategies. This research made two contributions with its cost and energy consumption analysis. We presented a multi-stakeholder method to improve smart microgrid performance in our initial contribution. Few microgrids have more than one operator, owner, and user. We think multi-stakeholder microgrids that use renewable and conventional power sources to combat environmental risks would work best. Stakeholders improve generation source variety, economies of scale, and operational opportunities. The extra stakeholders present governance, financial, and technological issues that may hinder multi-stakeholder adoption. We propose multi-stakeholder microgrids as an environmental solution and examine their development challenges. Simulation results demonstrate the suggested models' efficiency over existing techniques."

      "abstract": "The effectiveness and reliability of a power distribution system hinge on the establishment and maintenance of efficient coordination between protective relays. Alongside the prevention of unwarranted overloads, inadequate coordination among relays may lead to an increased likelihood of revealing concealed failures within crucial components of the protection system, like Circuit Breakers. To assess the potential degradation of system reliability due to protection system malfunctions, this study proposes the utilization of a Markov model (MM) in combination with a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) algorithm. Furthermore, the study also addresses the impact of the protective equipment mis-coordination on the concealed failure of protection systems. Subsequently, using a modified Canadian benchmark distribution system, the study computes the reliability indices of System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) and Expected Energy Not Supplied (EENS) for three distinct scenarios characterized by varying relay settings and protection coordination. The findings are subsequently presented to demonstrate how miscoordination of protection systems within the distribution network can affect the overall system reliability."

      "abstract": "Black start restoration (BSR) in power distribution networks presents several challenges due to the complexity of restoring power after a widespread blackout, including the coordination of multiple distributed energy resources (DERs), efficient restoration of all loads, and maintenance of stability. This paper addresses these issues by implementing a BSR methodology using the PowerModelsDistribution (PMD) and PowerModelsONM (ONM) packages. The implementation leverages PMD and ONM to model and optimize the restoration process by incorporating key components like such as distributed generators (DGs), loads, and switches. The packages provide a flexible and extensible framework for optimization in power distribution systems. The sequential BSR model ensures a systematic approach to restoring power, maximizing the total restored energy while adhering to operational constraints. The results from implementing the BSR process on modified IEEE 13-node test feeders show significant restoration in sequences and load recovery. This study aims to validate the BSR methodology within the PMD and ONM packages in optimizing the restoration process."

      "abstract": "The existing power grid scheduling systems often use a distributed generation model. Because they need to manage multiple independent generators simultaneously, this system may be more complex in terms of coordination, scheduling, and maintenance. In addition, the variability and intermittency of renewable energy resources can lead to reliability issues, causing grid instability. To address issues such as resource wastage, high costs, and grid instability that occur during the power grid resource scheduling process, this paper proposes an intelligent power distribution system to achieve a rational allocation of electrical resources throughout the network. Firstly, the algorithm introduces a deep learning-based node fault detection module to address the problem of the lack of real-time monitoring and fault detection capabilities in traditional distribution networks. Secondly, by modeling it as a Markov decision process (MDP), it constructs state, action, and reward functions and uses a deep reinforcement learning module based on double deep Q-network (DDQN) to optimize the objective function. This ensures the allocation of power resources during peak periods, reduces energy waste, and avoids overloads. Experiments show that this algorithm has excellent fault localization capabilities, improving the stability of the grid during peak electricity demand periods. Additionally, it offers more flexibility in resource scheduling, enabling more precise resource allocation."

The majority of the available research have considered either distribution or transmission grids in their studies. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the effects of DERs on the distribution and transmission grids is performed. The focus of this paper is on hierarchical management methods in order to categorize different approaches and highlight the gaps. Moreover, a review is conducted in the field of the newly introduced distributed energy resources management system (DERMS) concept. A DERMS can facilitate the hierarchical energy management procedure due to its functionalities and broad capabilities. Hence, its implementation in energy management and its impact on the power grid will be assessed with the aid of a co-simulation platform that considers both transmission and distribution grids."

      "abstract": "Large-scale distributed energy resource access brings opportunities and challenges to the flexibility of distribution systems. Currently, multiple voltage levels coexist in distribution systems, research on optimal allocation for the flexibility improvement of distribution systems mainly focus on single voltage level systems, and the collaborative optimization potential of flexibility resources across voltage levels is not fully exploded. Therefore, a two-level optimal allocation method of distributed energy resources for the medium and low voltage distribution system considering source-load-storage coordination is proposed in this paper. First, the influence of distributed renewable energy acceptance is analyzed from the perspectives of flexibility, voltage distribution and topology of different voltage levels. Secondly, a two-level optimal allocation model of distributed energy resources in medium and low-voltage distribution system is formed, the multi-objective model is solved by the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II. Finally, an improved medium and low voltage distribution system is used for simulation verification. Results show that the proposed method can reduce voltage deviation and network operating loss, and improve the system economy and flexibility."

Each bus acts as a local agent and can interact with the system operator in the distribution network to realize the joint operation. The proposed NDCRE leverages multi-parametric programming and dual decomposition for efficient information exchange and high decomposable structure. Such a scheme enables a fast finite convergent property in large-scale second-order cone programming, which significantly enhances the solution ability of CRE proposed in [1]. Numerical results verified its effectiveness in complex distribution grid settings."

      "abstract": "As distributed energy resources (DERs) grow, the electricity grid faces increased net load variability at the grid edge, impacting operability and reliability. Transactive energy, facilitated through local energy markets, offers a decentralized, indirect demand response solution, with model-free control techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL), enabling automated, decentralized participation. However, existing studies largely overlook community-level net load variability, focusing instead on socioeconomic metrics. This study addresses this gap by using DRL agents to automate end-user participation in a local energy market (ALEX), where agents act independently to minimize individual energy bills. Results reveal a strong link between bill reduction and decreased net load variability, assessed across metrics such as ramping rate, load factor, and peak demand over various time horizons. Using a no-control baseline, DRL agents are benchmarked against a near-optimal dynamic programming approach. The dynamic programming benchmark achieves reductions of 22.05 percent, 83.92 percent, and 24.09 percent in daily import, export, and peak demand, respectively, while the DRL agents show comparable or superior results with reductions of 21.93 percent, 84.46 percent, and 27.02 percent. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of DRL in decentralized grid management, highlighting its scalability and near-optimal performance in reducing net load variability within community-driven energy markets."

This problem can be cast as a convex optimization problem, where the global objective is to minimize a sum of convex functions corresponding to individual DER generation cost while satisfying 1) linear inequality constraints corresponding to the DER capacity limits and 2) a linear equality constraint corresponding to the total power generated by the DERs being equal to the total power demand. We develop distributed algorithms to solve the DER coordination problem over time-varying communication networks with either bidirectional or unidirectional communication links. The proposed algorithms can be seen as distributed versions of a centralized primal\u2013dual algorithm. One of the algorithms proposed for directed communication graphs has a geometric convergence rate even when communication out-degrees are unknown to agents. We showcase the proposed algorithms using the standard IEEE 39-bus test system and compare their performance against other ones proposed in the literature."

      "abstract": "\nMore and more distributed energy resources (DERs) are being added to the medium-voltage (MV) or low-voltage (LV) radial distribution networks (RDNs). These distributed power sources will cause the redistribution of power flow and fault current, bringing new challenges to the coordination of power system protection. An adaptive protection coordination strategy is proposed in this paper. It will trace the connectivity of the system structure to determine the set of relay numbers as a tracking path. According to the topology of the system structure, the tracking path can be divided into two categories: the main feeder path and the branch path. The time multiplier setting (TMS) of each relay can be used to evaluate the operation time of the over-current relay (OCR), and the operation time of the relay can be used to evaluate the fitness of the TMS setting combination. Furthermore, the relay protection coordination problem can be modeled to minimize the accumulated summation of all primary and backup relay operation time (OT) subject to the coordination time interval (CTI) limitation. A modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) algorithm with adaptive self-cognition and society operation scheme (ASSOS) was proposed and utilized to determine TMS for each relay on the tracking path. A 16-bus test MV system with distributed generators (DGs) will be applied to test the adaptive protection coordination approach proposed in this paper. The results show that the proposed MPSO algorithm reduces the overall OT and relieves the impact on protection coordination settings after DG joins the system. The paper also tests and compares the proposed MPSO with other metaheuristic intelligence-based random search algorithms to prove that MPSO possesses with increased efficiency and performance.\n"

      "abstract": "The massive penetration of Renewable Energy Sources, preminently wind and photovoltaic power plants, and Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), such as Combined Heat and Power plants, Battery Energy Storage System, Electric Vehicles impose additional challenges in power system planning and operation. Pushing towards a low-carbon electricity system can increase potential issues such as congestion management, voltage control, controllability, observability, and generation-load forecasting. In this context, coordinated actions between Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and Distribution Systems Operators (DSOs) could be a valuable solution. For instance, through the DERs installed on the distribution network, the DSO could help the TSO to relieve a network contingency on the HV/HHV grid. This paper proposes a feasibility study of TSO-DSO coordination that allows using DERs to solve transmission network criticalities, both in operational and short- to medium-term time horizons, that does not involve the exchange of sensitive information between the two utilities. A straightforward algorithm is proposed for evaluating DERs available flexibility in terms of active and reactive power, and for estimating the aggregated capability curve at the point of common coupling, i.e., the flexibility available downstream a HV/MV substation. The proposed algorithm has been applied to Milan's case study using real data from Unareti, the local DSO, and Terna, the Italian TSO."

      "abstract": "Microgrids are promising to enhance power distribution systems\u2019 efficiency, quality, sustainability, and reliability. However, microgrids operation can impose several challenges to traditional protection schemes, like changes in the power flow direction and an increase in short-circuit currents. Microgrids can include several distributed generation technologies with different behaviours during short-circuit conditions, requiring additional protection schemes and devices. In this way, the optimized coordination of reclosers and fuses in distribution networks with directional overcurrent relays, which operate as interconnection devices, might overcome many imposed protection challenges. Regarding different generation technologies, voltage-restrained overcurrent relays and frequency relays are presented as local microgrid protection for rotative and inverter-based distributed generators, respectively. The optimized coordination of these protection devices maximizes microgrid benefits and minimizes operation drawbacks by reducing interruptions impacts and energy not supplied to consumers. This work proposes, thus, a mathematical model for the optimal coordination of protection devices in distribution networks with distributed energy resources operating in grid-connected and islanded modes. The minimization technique of operating times using an elitist genetic algorithm with variable crossover and mutation processes is proposed, as well. The results show adequate coordination using passive and low-cost protection devices."

      "abstract": "Low-voltage grid-connected microgrids rely on the exploitation of inverter-interfaced distributed energy resources (DERs) in order to feed loads and to achieve bidirectional power flow controllability at their point of common coupling (PCC) with the upstream grid. However, adverse operational conditions, such as the existence of DERs of different operation natures, DERs of non-equal power ratings, as well as the occurrence of non-steady and non-sinusoidal grid voltage scenarios, bring complications to microgrid energy management. Consequently, control strategies employed to coordinate DERs in dispatchable microgrids need to be resilient to such non-ideal conditions. Hence, this paper demonstrates that a multi-purpose strategy, so-called the Generalized Current-Based Control (GCBC) approach, is capable of steering DERs under such adverse operational scenarios, ensuring proportional current sharing among them while also regulating the microgrid power dispatchability at the PCC. The discussions are supported by an extensive experimental validation on a laboratory-scale single-phase microgrid prototype, demonstrating that the GCBC approach allows DERs of different operational natures to be coordinated, respecting their power ratings, and allowing the single-controllable microgrid to endure operation under distorted voltages and support voltage ride-through conditions."

      "abstract": "The present design of protection systems is based on power flowing in a single direction, which allows for unpolarized (non-directional) protection schemes. With the large influx of renewable technologies recently introduced into the electric power system, referred to as distributed energy resources (DER), creates many challenges to adequately maintain existing protection schemes. Protection engineers design protection systems to safely eliminate faults from the electric power system that was exclusively built with rotating machines (which have quite a different behavior under fault than inverter-based sources). As the penetration level of DER increases, the adverse impacts from DER is no longer to be considered minimal. With DER becoming influential in the distribution system, the current utility protection strategy merits a comprehensive investigation. This paper discusses major protection issues caused by DERs and provides utility-verified solutions based on more than 500 DER interconnection project system impact studies. An optimized coordination flow chart is provided in this paper along with software CYMEDIST-verified real US utility radial distribution feeders, which were used for simulations and related validation."

Many existing RL approaches, including Q-learning and approximate dynamic programming, are based on lookup table methods, which become inefficient when the problem size is large and infeasible when continuous states and actions are involved. In addition, when modeling battery energy storage systems (BESSS), the loss of life is not reasonably considered in the decision-making process. This paper proposes an innovative deep RL method for DER coordination considering BESS degradation. The proposed deep RL is designed based on an adaptive actor-critic architecture and employs an off-policy deterministic policy gradient method for determining the dispatch operation that minimizes the operation cost and BESS loss of life. Case studies were performed to validate the proposed method and demonstrate the effects of incorporating degradation models into control design."

This paper analyzes the problem of long-term voltage instability and presenting possible countermeasures. The study summarizes essential aspects for modelling, including LTC, DERs, and especially voltage dependent load. A coordination between DERs and LTC is proposed to allocate better power supply, especially at the coupling points between transmission and distribution networks, i.e. primary substation. A case study is performed using a modified CIGRE medium-voltage benchmark network. The simulation results have shown that the coordination has substantially improved the long-term voltage stability in the way of using the reactive power support from DERs and increasing the LTC position instated of decreasing as the traditional method."

Aimed at ensuring system reliability while providing open access to DERAs, the coordination mechanism includes a forward auction that allocates access limits to aggregators based on aggregators\u2019 bids that represent their benefits of aggregation. The proposed coordination mechanism results in decoupled DSO and DERAs operations that satisfy the network constraints, independent of the stochasticity of the renewables, wholesale real-time locational marginal prices, and individual DERA\u2019s aggregation policy. Optimal bidding strategies by competitive aggregators are also derived. The efficiency of the coordination mechanism and the locational price distribution at buses of a radial distribution grid are demonstrated for a 141-bus radial network."

The coordination of DERs through an aggregator, such as a utility, system operator, or a third-party coordinator, emerges as a promising paradigm. However, it is not well understood how to enable trust between the aggregator and DERs to integrate DERs efficiently. In this paper, we develop a trustable and distributed coordination system for DERs using blockchain technology. We model various DERs and formulate a cost minimization problem for DERs to optimize their energy trading, scheduling, and demand response. We use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the problem in a distributed fashion. To implement the distributed algorithm in a trustable way, we design a smart contract to update multipliers and communicate with DERs in a blockchain network. We validate our design by experiments using real-world data, and the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm."

This research article presents a comprehensive investigative analysis of the distributed generation (DG) impacts on the protection performance of the distribution network. Various protection coordination case studies have been analyzed under different operating conditions by varying the DG penetration level or the fault conditions to highlight the potential risks of the protection networks. The severity of the risks is evaluated by considering the DG locations, protection settings, and fault types/impedance parameters on a standardized IEEE 13 node test feeder. The subsequent protection hazards are examined for the mutual coordination of the overcurrent (OC) relays, auto-reclosers, and series fuses in distribution networks. Furthermore, the impacts of DGs/PDs types are assessed on the nuisance tripping of the protection networks and results are reported."

When a large of photovoltaic (PV) is integrated into the power system, the problem of voltage fluctuation that affects the safety and stability on system operations may be met. It is thus necessary to seek useful manners for the mitigation and improvement of this problem. In this paper, a AC microgrid system operates in a 11.4 kV distribution feeder is studied. A coordination control strategy based on the implementations of on-load tap changer (OLTC) transformer and PV inverter (PVI) in microgrid will be proposed for the voltage regulation of the studied distribution feeder. In proposed method, local voltage level (LVL) method and voltage/var control (VVC) method will be separately used for OLTC transformer and PV inverter, and MATLAB/Simulink will be used to carry out the proposed method and to perform simulation test. Finally, simulations under un-coordination and coordination controls will be compared to verify the proposed voltage regulation method."

      "abstract": "Distributed energy resources (DERs) have the potential for the non-lines alternative in both transmission and distribution (T&D) systems. However, the value of DERs in substituting power lines in T&D systems is not revealed and coordinated planning of T&D networks and DERs under market environment is not studied in existing researches. This may damage the interests of DER investors, hinder the wide integration of DERs in power system and increase total cost under market environment. This paper proposes market-based coordination of transmission and distribution network planning (TDNP) with DER planning (DERP). The model is formulated as multi-stage programming. In first stage, transmission companies (TRANSCOs), distribution companies (DISCOs), and DER aggregators (DERAs) send their bidding plans to independent system operator (ISO) and distribution system operators (DSOs), respectively. In second stage, ISO and DSOs check the transmission and distribution network securities, respectively. In third stage, ISO and DSOs solve their optimal operation problems, respectively. An iterative solution algorithm is proposed to solve the multistage model. The solution embodies the interaction process among TRANSCOs, DISCOs, DERAs, ISO, and DSOs in electricity market. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model coordinates TDNP with DERP, promotes DER installations and reduces the total cost."

The model considers time-coupling devices including electric vehicles and heat pumps by deviating as little as possible from their original schedules while prioritizing DERs with the most urgent demand using dynamic cost terms. The model does not require a multi-period setting or a multi-period-ahead forecast, which enables the model to alleviate the computational difficulty and enhance its applicability for DSOs to manage the grids in real time. A case study using a Dutch low-voltage grid assuming a 100% penetration scenario of electric vehicles, heat pumps, and photovoltaics (PVs) in the households validates that the proposed model can resolve the network issues while not affecting user comfort."

      "abstract": "This paper proposes and implements a model-free optimal strategy to regulate the voltage in distribution systems by effective control of Inverter-Interfaced Distributed Energy Resources (I-DERs) output power. In distribution systems, where the ratio of R/X is considerable, reactive power control is not always an optimum solution for voltage regulation. With the aim of improving voltage regulation, this paper proposes an alternative method to optimally coordinate active and reactive power of I-DERs in the grid. The proposed method does not need to have a system model and phase measurement, which are barriers in control and operation of behind-the-meter assets. The paper formulates the problem of voltage regulation in form of equilibrium-map-with-optimum, without any restriction on system configuration, amount of reverse power flow and losses. Using the extremum seeking control technique and without an explicit model of distribution circuit, the ratio of active and reactive power is coordinated in real time. The amount of exchanged apparent power is also adjusted simultaneously. Simulation results for a typical distribution circuit verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach in improving the voltage regulation performance. The experimental results also show a 20 percent reduction in use of system capacity to provide the desired voltage regulation performance."

      "abstract": "Renewable portfolio standards are targeting high levels of variable solar photovoltaics (PV) in electric distribution systems, which makes reliability more challenging to maintain for distribution system operators (DSOs). Distributed energy resources (DERs), including smart, connected appliances and PV inverters, represent responsive grid resources that can provide flexibility to support the DSO in actively managing their networks to facilitate reliability under extreme levels of solar PV. This flexibility can also be used to optimize system operations with respect to economic signals from wholesale energy and ancillary service markets. Here, we present a novel hierarchical scheme that actively controls behind-the-meter DERs to reliably manage each unbalanced distribution feeder and exploits the available flexibility to ensure reliable operation and economically optimizes the entire distribution network. Each layer of the scheme employs advanced optimization methods at different timescales to ensure that the system operates within both grid and device limits. The hierarchy is validated in a large-scale realistic simulation based on data from the industry. Simulation results show that coordination of flexibility improves both system reliability and economics, and enables greater penetration of solar PV. Discussion is also provided on the practical viability of the required communications and controls to implement the presented scheme within a large DSO."

      "abstract": "The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs), e.g., electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable distributed generation (DG), in the electrical distribution system (EDS) brings advantages to society, but also introduces technical challenges (e.g., overloading and voltage issues). A DER aggregator, which has agreements with DERs to manage their consumption/generation, could collaborate with the EDS operator to mitigate those technical challenges. Previous approaches have mainly focused on the aggregator\u2019s strategy to manage demand, aiming at the maximization of profits. Therefore, methods to support the aggregator\u2019s strategy need to be extended to facilitate the integration of renewable DG, leading to an enhanced coordination of DERs. This paper proposes a linear programming model for the aggregator\u2019s coordination strategy to maximize its profit through the management of DERs and the participation in the day-ahead reserve market. The model uses EV charging control to provide up/down reserve and reduces its cost taking advantage of DG. The proposed mathematical model represents the daily EDS operation (hourly resolution) to enforce voltage and current magnitude constraints. A case study carried out in an unbalanced 34-bus EDS with 660 EVs, demonstrates that the application of the proposed method enhances the DER aggregator\u2019s strategy, leading to better outcomes in both profits and EDS operation."

      "abstract": "Growing penetration of uncoordinated Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in distribution systems is contributing to the increase of the load variability to be covered at the transmission system level. Forced, fast and substantial changes of power plants\u2019 output powers increase the risk of their failures, which threatens the reliable and safe delivery of electricity to end users in the power system. The paper handles this issue with the use of DERs and proposes a bilevel coordination concept of day-ahead operation planning with new kind of bids to be submitted by Distribution System Operators (DSOs) to the Transmission System Operator (TSO). This concept includes the extension of the Unit Commitment problem solved by TSO and a new optimization model to be solved by DSO for planning a smoothed power profile at the Transmission\u2013Distribution (T\u2013D) interface. Both optimization models are described in the paper. As simulations show, the modified 24-h power profiles at T\u2013D interfaces result in a reduction of the demand for operation flexibility at the transmission system level and, importantly, result in a decrease of the number of conventional power plants that are required to operate during a day. Additionally, it has been proved that the modified profiles reduce the congestions in the transmission network. Hence, the concept presented in the paper can be identified as an important step towards the transformation of power systems to low-emission and reliable systems with high share of DERs."

      "abstract": "Electric power networks face vulnerabilities from various hazards, including extreme weather and natural disasters, resulting in prolonged outages and service disruptions. This paper proposes prosumer-centric networked electrical microgrids as a solution. EMGs integrate DERs, like SPV panels, WTs, BESSs, and BEVs, to form autonomous microgrids capable of operating independently during grid disruptions. The SMA was used to identify the appropriate allocation of DERs and BEVs to improve the resilience of the system. Prosumers, acting as both producers and consumers, play a crucial role by generating and sharing electricity within the microgrid. BEVs act as mobile energy storage units during emergencies. Load management and demand response strategies prioritize the energy needs for essential facilities, ensuring uninterrupted operation during adverse weather. Robust communication and control systems improve the emergency coordination and response. The resilience analysis focused on two case studies: moderate and severe damage, both under varying weather conditions. Simulations and experiments assessed the microgrid performance with different levels of DERs and demand. By testing on the IEEE 69-bus RDS, evaluated the EMGs\u2019 strengths and limitations, demonstrating their potential to enhance distribution grid resilience against natural disasters."

While ensuring the safety performance of the MASs, the mechanism adaptively and dynamically adjusts the trigger threshold of every agent to achieve discontinuous communication by using only the current and latest sampled signals. According to the MASs communication mode and Bernoulli attack model, a security consensus control protocol is constructed, and a bilateral sampled\u2010interval Lyapunov functional (BSILF) method is introduced to obtain more sampling interval information and establish sufficient conditions for the leader\u2010following state error system to stabilize asymptotically under hybrid random cyber attacks. Meanwhile, under a large sampling interval, the controller gain and adaptive event\u2010triggered parameters are designed and obtained. The simulation of the tunnel diode circuit system shows that the SIRAETCM can reduce the number of communications between agents to improve bandwidth utilization, and the adopted safety cooperative control protocol can improve the safety and effectiveness of the MASs."

To begin with, for the follower agents with unknown inputs, through an interval observer, the estimations of unknown input (UI) and system state can be obtained asymptotically and simultaneously by a Luenberger-like state observer (LLSO) combining with a UIR. After this, a distributed control protocol (DCP) on formation tracking is proposed based on the UIR and the state estimation, which can compensate the UI successfully. Moreover, the time space is divided into three parts utilizing the transmission interruption caused by DoS attacks, and the gain of the controller is designed corresponding to three different DoS attack duration, respectively. With the help of some concept in switched system, it is demonstrated that the given formation pattern can be reached under the proposed DCP. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods, a vehicle cruise control system used as the simulation example is given."

      "abstract": "Due to their special characteristics, vehicle-based ad hoc networks (VANET) are susceptible to a number of security issues. Particularly when many vehicles are present within the RSU\u2019s coverage area, existing authentication methods struggle to ensure that the roadside unit (RSU) rapidly authenticates each vehicle\u2019s signature. A novel agent-based message verification method is consequently proposed. The proxy vehicle analyses the messages sent by other vehicles and sends the results of its analysis to the neighbouring RSU. The RSU verifies the output results from the proxy vehicle to reduce computational overhead. The proposed method has been shown to satisfy the message authentication security requirements under the discrete logarithm issue for the elliptic curve. Additionally, simulation results show that the suggested authentication method requires 76% less time to validate 3,000 messages than the conventional authentication method and can more effectively meet the VANET\u2019s requirements for message authentication."

      "abstract": "This paper studies secure consensus control for multi-agent systems subject to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The DoS attacks cause changes in topologies, which will destroy the channels of communication and result in network paralysis. Unlike the existing publications with Markov switching, this paper mainly studies the topological structure changes of the subsystem models after DoS attacks. To ensure the consensus of systems, this paper designs an event triggered to reduce the use of the controller and decrease the influence of channel breaks off caused by DoS attacks. On this basis, different Lyapunov functions are established in each period of attack. Then, stochastic and Lyapunov stable theory is used to form the consensus criteria. Moreover, Zeno behavior is excluded by theoretical analysis. Finally, the simulation experiment proves the effectiveness of the proposed protocol."

SNMP is supported by Open Platform Communication (OPC) and recent microcontrollers. Therefore, it can be used to integrate OPC and micro controllers. This paper aims to measure the SNMP performances such as data validity and latency during data communication. The SNMP protocol is implemented in the IoT sensor (MQ-6 gas sensor) integration system with the human-machine interface (HMI) via an OPC server. The MQ-6 sensor is integrated with the ESP32 micro controller as a tool for processing sensor data. The micro controller is then configured to become an SNMP Agent to communicate with the OPC Server, which acts as the SNMP Manager. Then, the OPC Server becomes the data center for several OPC Clients, including HMI and Prosys OPC Client as historians. The results show that the data was successfully sent and displayed on the HMI. The data transmitted using the SNMP protocol is validated with the data sent using a web-based protocol without SNMP. In testing duration for 30 minutes, the average latency was 17.7 ms without any data corruption or Request Time Out (RTO)."

      "abstract": "Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) gateways connected to the Internet are often based on conventional operating systems such as Linux and on conventional communication protocols such as HTTPS and therefore are valuable targets for malicious attackers. When compromised, a malicious IIoT gateway can interfere with data exchanged between IIoT devices and systems running on servers or the Cloud. The Gateway Integrity Checking Protocol (GIP), proposed in previous work, defines a gossip mechanism to collect data from sets of IIoT devices to respond to security challenges issued by an External Security Agent (ESA) to assess a gateways trustworthiness. GIP relies on a secure channel between IIoT devices and the ESA, which is achieved using a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for message authentication and encryption. In this paper we perform an analysis of the security measures employed by GIP, using formal descriptions to demonstrate that GIP is no less secure than the hash algorithm and the public key infrastructure used. Additionally, we simulate different configurations of GIP to measure detection rate and time to detect integrity faults."

Terminal devices in the system need to register their information in the IoT management center in order to obtain the identity and key of the terminal devices.

      "abstract": "This paper introduces an event-triggered secure control scheme for human-in-the-loop multi-agent systems in the context of DoS attacks. The integration of human intelligence and decision-making significantly enhances system security, as a human provides command signals to a non-autonomous leader agent. To determine unknown states, an adaptive neural state observer utilizes neural networks to approximate nonlinear functions, while a relative threshold-based event-triggered con-trol strategy is introduced to optimize communication resource usage. At the same time, a predictor is developed to monitor potential compromises in the edges of the multi-agent network to counteract attacks. Using Lyapunov analysis, it is shown that the proposed secure control protocol is capable of maintaining bounded closed-loop signals despite the occurrence of attacks. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated by the simulation results."

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) create an extensive fighting capability of the developed military forces. Particularly, these systems carrying confidential data are exposed to security attacks. By the wireless\u2019s nature within these networks, they become susceptible to different kinds of attacks, hence, it seems essential to design the appropriate safety mechanism in such networks. The sinkhole attack is one of the most dangerous and threatening attacks amongst types of attack in UAS. A malicious UAV exists in such a threat attacking as a black hole for absorbing all traffic in the network. Mainly, in a Flow-based protocol, the attacker considers the requests on the route, then, it replies to the target UAV such as high quality or the best route towards Gard station. The malicious UAV is able to only insert itself on one occasion between the nodes relating to each other (such as sink node and sensor node), and act for passing packets among them. In this study, the malicious attacks are detected and purged using two stages were. In the first stage, some principles and rules are used to detect black hole, gray hole, and sinkhole attacks. In the second stage, using a smart agent-based strategy negotiation procedure for three steps, a defense mechanism is designed to prevent these attacks. The smart agent is used by reliable neighbors via the negotiation procedure for three steps, hence, the traffic formed by the malicious UAV is not considered. The suggested protocol is called SAUAS. Here, the technique is assessed through extensive simulations performed in the NS-3 environment. Based on the simulation outcomes, it is indicated that the UAS network performance metrics are enhanced based on the packet delivery rate, detection rate, false-negative rate and false-positive rate."

      "abstract": "In-vehicle networks handle the communication among Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and sensors with a serial protocol called Controller Area Network (CAN), which takes advantage of a broadcast mechanism for transferring data. However, the lack of authentication and encryption in CAN bus might lead to the vehicle being compromised by an untrusted agent. Meanwhile, AI-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) introduced in the literature require a centralized cloud server to undertake the resource-consuming task of processing network data, which also occupies the bandwidth while transferring data from vehicles to the remote server. Moreover, many car manufacturers avoid sharing information with the remote server to prevent further exposure of vehicles\u2019 private data. We utilize Federated Learning (FL) as a suitable solution to previous challenges, where data is trained locally on the vehicle side, and partially trained models are sent to the server. Nevertheless, private training in-side the vehicle requires low memory utilization while achieving low latency and high performance compared to Centralized Learning (CL) approaches. In this study, we propose a practical privacy-preserving IDS (ImageFed) approach by employing federated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). To evaluate the robustness of ImageFed in real-world applications, we investigate two scenarios that may cause performance degradation in FL, such as non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) clients and scarcity of training data during the process. The resulting analysis proves the robustness of ImageFed while delivering an average 99.54% f1-score, 99.87% accuracy, and low detection latency."

      "abstract": "Mobile agent system is a satisfying solution for the implementation and maintenance of applications distributed over large-scale networks, this solution is very used in solving complex problems since they are autonomous, Intelligent, robust and faulttolerant. Mobile agents have the capacity to migrate from one node to another all over the network allowing reduction in communication costs. Although they possess all these advantages, using them in distributed environment increases the threat to mobile agent security and during their mobility they can face different types of attacks such as of attacks like Replay attack, man-in-the-middle attack, Cookie theft attack, Offline password guessing attack, Stolen-verifier attack. In this paper we investigate the security of distributed mobile agent system. We propose a solution based on a secure Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) protocol to ensure mutual authentication and protect the agent from different known attacks. The implementation of the proposed solution is obtained using Java Agent Development Framework (JADE). Also, Binary serialization is used to establish a flexible portability of the agent. Finally, we present security and performance analysis, for our solution to secure mobile agent in distributed systems."

As a revolutionary technology, blockchain has drawn the attention of academics and researchers. Cryptocurrencies have already effectively utilized BC technology. Many researchers have sought to implement this technique in different sectors, including the Internet of Things. To store and manage IoT data, we present in this paper a lightweight BC-based architecture with a modified raft algorithm-based consensus protocol. We designed a Device Agent that executes a novel registration procedure to connect IoT devices to the blockchain. We implemented the framework on Docker using the Go programming language. We have simulated the framework on a Linux environment hosted in the cloud. We have conducted a detailed performance analysis using a variety of measures. The results demonstrate that our suggested solution is suitable for facilitating the management of IoT data with increased security and privacy. In terms of throughput and block generation time, the results indicate that our solution might be 40% to 45% faster than the existing blockchain."

      "abstract": "Wireless Ad-hoc network is a dynamic network without any physical architecture in which each and every node participating in the network and may exit at any moment. Because of the nature of its simplicity and adaptability, a wireless network is widely employed in military communications, emergency communications, academic goals and mobile conferences. Due to the dynamic nature of the Adhoc network, it is prone to attacks. So, there are always security issues related to the wireless network because any node may enter into the network anytime or may leave anytime with authentication. So, there is always a chance that malicious node may enter into the network and hampers the communication system of the entire network. One among them is the black hole attack. The black hole affects the entire network with its malicious behaviour while checking out the communication path between source and destination. For connection, establishment RREQ message is transmitted from the source node and they will wait for RRRP. For each RREQ received, the black hole nodes send the source node fake RREP. The origin node responds to fake RREPs and sends their data by the path described in the fake RREP which ultimately may result in packet drop or alteration of the packets by black hole nodes. This research work designed a detection technique to avoid black hole attacks and improve network performance. In this work, an adaptive technique based on the AODV routing protocol is presented upon request. In this analysis, Some of the sender nodes are assigned a task of the agent that checks the incoming route reply message for the destination nodes and avoid malicious node in the network. The resulting analysis shows that packet delivery ratio had increased with detection technique as compared to without detection technique i.e. blackhole condition."

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has facilitated services without human intervention for a wide range of applications, including continuous remote patient monitoring (RPM). However, the complexity of RPM architectures, the size of data sets generated and limited power capacity of devices make RPM challenging. In this paper, we propose a tier-based End to End architecture for continuous patient monitoring that has a patient centric agent (PCA) as its center piece. The PCA manages a blockchain component to preserve privacy when data streaming from body area sensors needs to be stored securely. The PCA based architecture includes a lightweight communication protocol to enforce security of data through different segments of a continuous, real time patient monitoring architecture. The architecture includes the insertion of data into a personal blockchain to facilitate data sharing amongst healthcare professionals and integration into electronic health records while ensuring privacy is maintained. The blockchain is customized for RPM with modifications that include having the PCA select a Miner to reduce computational effort, enabling the PCA to manage multiple blockchains for the same patient, and the modification of each block with a prefix tree to minimize energy consumption and incorporate secure transaction payments. Simulation results demonstrate that security and privacy can be enhanced in RPM with the PCA based End to End architecture."

      "abstract": "At present, distributed secondary frequency regulation based on multi-agent system (MAS) has become the most commonly used secondary frequency regulation method, but this method also brings network security risks. Therefore, this paper proposes a false data injection attack (FDIA) detection algorithm based on active power difference. Based on this algorithm, an attack elimination factor is added to the proposed consistency protocol to eliminate false data injection attacks. Considering that the communication delay will affect the convergence rate of MAS system, the consistency protocol is optimized. In addition, this paper optimizes a cooperative frequency regulation strategy, and distinguishes the strategies according to different scenarios. According to the order of action, the strategy is divided into two levels and three levels. Finally, a simulation model is built to test the defense algorithm and control strategy. The simulation results show the effectiveness and superiority of FDIA defense algorithm and frequency control strategy."

Traditional approaches often fall short in predicting failures and optimizing performance across diverse and dynamic renewable energy infrastructures. This study investigates the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for predictive maintenance and optimization of renewable energy systems, with the aim of enhancing operational efficiency and extending system longevity. We employ a combination of machine learning algorithms, including deep neural networks and reinforcement learning, to develop predictive models and optimization strategies. These models are trained on large-scale datasets collected from operational wind farms, solar installations, and hydroelectric plants. Our results demonstrate that AI-driven approaches can predict equipment failures with 92% accuracy, reducing unplanned downtime by 35% compared to traditional methods. Moreover, AI-optimized operational parameters improved overall energy output by 8.5% across the studied systems. The proposed framework also showed adaptability to various environmental conditions and system configurations, suggesting broad applicability across the renewable energy sector. This research underscores the significant potential of AI in revolutionizing maintenance practices and operational strategies in renewable energy systems, paving the way for more reliable, efficient, and sustainable clean energy production."

      "abstract": "The application of wind power within smart grids is crucial thereby mandating integrative energy change. Yet, the randomness of wind and technological nature of wind turbines lead to quite a number of problems regarding the dependability and performance of supplied energy. These issues can be managed through the help of predictive maintenance which reduces the time that is taken in the machinery\u2019s periodic maintenance while at the same time reduces the cost of the overall maintenance. The following research work puts forward a framework for developing deep learning models to improve the approaches to maintain the wind energy systems using LSTM networks. The framework is based on the Wind Turbine SCADA Dataset which is a collection of time-series of various parameters of the turbine like wind speed, power output, rotor speed, temperature, and vibration and aims at predicting the probable equipment failures in future. The LSTM network used for the diagnosis of mechanical problems learns from the sensor data and watches for anomalies in real-time. Thus, owing to the organization of the maintenance activities according to such predictions, the framework minimizes the unexpected downtimes, and increases the lifespan of the turbine components, as well as the reliability of the energy production. In addition, the proposed business incorporates the predictive maintenance system into the smart grid system to facilitate energy management and the synchronization of the maintenance system with grid functionality. The research also responds to important issues: the fluctuation in the wind energy data and the adaptability of an LSTM model to large power stations."

      "abstract": "The integration of machine learning (ML) into wind energy systems holds significant promise for enhancing both predictive maintenance and operational efficiency. Wind energy, a cornerstone of renewable energy sources, faces challenges related to maintenance and efficiency, which can impede its reliability and cost-effectiveness. Traditional maintenance approaches often result in unexpected failures and downtimes, while optimizing turbine performance remains a complex task due to the variability of wind conditions. This paper explores the application of machine learning techniques to address these challenges. Predictive maintenance leverages ML algorithms to analyze historical and real-time data, identifying patterns and anomalies that precede component failures. Techniques such as supervised learning for failure prediction and unsupervised learning for anomaly detection enable timely interventions, reducing downtime and maintenance costs. Concurrently, ML models contribute to efficiency enhancement by optimizing turbine performance. These models predict power output based on environmental conditions and operational parameters, facilitating adaptive control systems that maximize energy capture and minimize wear and tear. Case studies demonstrate the practical implementation and benefits of these approaches. For instance, the application of time-series forecasting for condition monitoring has shown a significant reduction in unexpected failures, while optimization algorithms have improved turbine performance by adjusting operational parameters in real time. Despite the promising results, challenges such as data quality, model accuracy, and integration with existing systems persist. Looking forward, advancements in ML techniques, improved data collection methods, and the integration of emerging technologies like IoT and edge computing are expected to further enhance the capabilities of wind energy systems. This paper underscores the transformative potential of machine learning in creating more reliable, efficient, and cost-effective wind energy solutions, paving the way for a sustainable energy future. \nKeywords: Wind Energy Systems, Machine Learning, Predictive Maintenance, Efficiency Enhancement."

      "abstract": "Buildings consume around 40% of the total global energy consumption, while within the building, the HVAC systems are the most energy-hungry systems responsible for more than half of the total building\u2019s energy consumption. In addition, the most challenging task for facility managers is the maintenance of the HVAC system. Since the HVAC system is one of the necessities in modern buildings to maintain a comfortable and healthy environment. This is necessary to ensure proper maintenance of the HVAC system, specifically the faults detection and diagnostic to avoid system downtime and energy wastage and to enhance the HVAC system\u2019s lifespan. In this research work, we proposed a data-driven fault detection framework for predictive maintenance in HVAC systems of modern buildings using machine learning. In specific, the proposed data-driven framework is implemented using 8 different machine learning techniques for accurate fault detection, and their performance is evaluated using 4 different metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score. Extra Tree, Random Forest, and CatBoost classifiers outperformed the rest of the machine-learning techniques in all evaluation metrics. Further, the comparison of best-performer machine learning models is performed for each fault category detection. CatBoost and Random Forest are found more efficient in comparison to Extra Tree when evaluated for individual faults detection. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed machine learning- based data-driven framework for fault detection in HVAC systems."

      "abstract": "Air compressors are widely used in industrial fields. Compressed air systems aggregate air flows and then supply them to places of demand. These huge systems consume a significant amount of energy and generate heat internally. Machine components in compressed air systems are vulnerable to heat, and, in particular, a radiator to cool the heat of the overall air compressor is the core component. Dirty radiators increase energy consumption due to anomalous cooling. To reduce the energy consumption of air compressors, this mechanism emphasizes a machine learning-based radiator fault detection, using features such as RPM, motor power, outlet pressure, air flow, water pump power, and outlet temperature with slight true fault labels. Moreover, the proposed system adds an LSTM-based motor power prediction model to point out the initial judgment of radiator fault possibility. Via the rigorous analysis and the comparison among machine learning models, this meticulous approach improves the performance of radiator fault prediction up to 93.0%, and decreases the mean power consumption of the air compressor around 2.24%."

      "abstract": "Predictive maintenance (PdM) in industrial systems seeks to forecast equipment failures before they occur, thereby reducing unplanned downtime, maintenance costs, and safety risks. Leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques\u2014such as decision trees, support vector machines (SVMs), random forests, and artificial neural networks (ANNs)\u2014enables the analysis of vast sensor\u2011generated datasets for early fault detection and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. This manuscript presents a comprehensive framework for applying ML to PdM within manufacturing and energy sectors, focusing on data acquisition, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. We compare classical ML methods (Random Forest, SVM, ANN) against deep learning approaches (Long Short\u2011Term Memory networks, CNN\u2011based classifiers) using a benchmark rolling bearing dataset. A detailed statistical analysis, including one table of performance metrics, demonstrates that deep learning methods can achieve up to 92% classification accuracy and an F1\u2011score of 0.90, surpassing classical techniques in both predictive accuracy and robustness to noisy data. We also explore dimensionality reduction via principal component analysis (PCA) to balance computational efficiency and model performance. Finally, we discuss scope and limitations\u2014highlighting data quality concerns, sensor heterogeneity, and computational costs\u2014and offer practical guidelines for implementing PdM solutions with technologies available up to 2022. The findings underscore ML\u2011driven strategies\u2019 potential to transform maintenance practices, improve operational reliability, and inform best practices for engineering deployment. In addition to demonstrating superior classification performance, this study provides a clear roadmap for practitioners selecting and tuning ML pipelines under real\u2011world constraints such as limited labeled data, variable operating environments, and heterogeneous sensor platforms. We delve into the practicalities of deploying ML models on edge devices versus centralized cloud infrastructure, examining trade\u2011offs in latency, throughput, and model update cycles. We also outline strategies for incremental learning to accommodate evolving fault modes without full retraining. By anchoring all techniques to peer\u2011reviewed studies and industrial case examples through 2022, this work ensures relevance for engineers and decision-makers tasked with modernizing maintenance operations in sectors ranging from automotive assembly to power plant management."

      "abstract": "Solar photovoltaic (SPV) arrays are crucial components of clean and sustainable energy infrastructure. However, SPV panels are susceptible to thermal degradation defects that can impact their performance, thereby necessitating timely and accurate fault detection to maintain optimal energy generation. The considered case study focuses on an intelligent fault detection and diagnosis (IFDD) system for the analysis of radiometric infrared thermography (IRT) of SPV arrays in a predictive maintenance setting, enabling remote inspection and diagnostic monitoring of the SPV power plant sites. The proposed IFDD system employs a custom-developed deep learning approach which relies on convolutional neural networks for effective multiclass classification of defect types. The diagnosis of SPV panels is a challenging task for issues such as IRT data scarcity, defect-patterns\u2019 complexity, and low thermal image acquisition quality due to noise and calibration issues. Hence, this research carefully prepares a customized high-quality but severely imbalanced six-class thermographic radiometric dataset of SPV panels. With respect to previous approaches, numerical temperature values in floating-point are used to train and validate the predictive models. The trained models display high accuracy for efficient thermal anomaly diagnosis. Finally, to create a trust in the IFDD system, the process underlying the classification model is investigated with perceptive explainability, for portraying the most discriminant image features, and mathematical-structure-based interpretability, to achieve multiclass feature clustering."

Even though many fault diagnosis methods have been proposed, a major challenge remains the lack of accurate predictive maintenance routines for utility-scale PV systems. The scope of this work is to address this fundamental challenge by proposing a data-driven predictive maintenance alerting routine (that leverages digital twin technologies and decision rules) for detecting and predicting PV system faults. The results demonstrated that the developed predictive maintenance routine yielded a sensitivity of 93.9% for PV utility-scale failure detection over a yearly test period. The findings of the predictive maintenance alerting model proved its capability to anticipate faults up to 10 days in advance, achieving a sensitivity of 83.3%. Finally, the predictive maintenance alerting system can be used by operation and maintenance teams for scheduling corrective actions and optimizing field activities."

      "abstract": "The growing complexity and critical importance of energy infrastructure necessitate the adoption of advanced maintenance strategies to ensure reliability, efficiency, and sustainability. Traditional maintenance approaches, such as reactive and preventive maintenance, have proven inadequate in addressing the challenges posed by modern energy systems, particularly with the integration of renewable energy sources. This research explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven predictive maintenance (PdM) as a transformative solution for the energy sector. By leveraging historical maintenance records and real-time sensor data, AI models, including machine learning and deep learning techniques, were developed to predict equipment failures with high accuracy. The study employed a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of data and qualitative insights from case studies conducted in wind farms, solar power plants, and thermal power plants. The results demonstrated that AI-driven PdM significantly reduces unplanned downtime, lowers maintenance costs, and extends the lifespan of critical energy assets. Deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), outperformed traditional models in terms of predictive accuracy, with F1-scores exceeding 90%. Despite the promising results, the research also identified challenges related to data quality, system integration, and organizational adoption. These challenges highlight the need for further research in areas such as explainable AI, the integration of IoT and digital twins, and the exploration of PdM applications across different sectors. The findings underscore the potential of AI-driven PdM to revolutionize maintenance practices in the energy sector, offering a pathway to more reliable, efficient, and sustainable energy systems."

The advanced maintenance of the electrical grid is obtained through modern strategies to enhance the performance of the system. Power transformers are an important part of the electrical distribution systems. Failure of transformers leads to various constraints regarding service interferences with costly outrages. Traditional forms of maintenance rely on manual inspections on fixed timelines which is not able to detect the transformer degradation at early stages. Advanced predictive maintenance with energy management is obtained through deep learning techniques with hybrid optimization techniques. This includes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This is done through various sensors and monitoring equipment placed in the distribution network. The extraction of spatial and temporal data from images is obtained through the CNN component. The hidden defects and abnormal functioning of various parts in the transformer are detected through CNN. Oil leakages, overheating and insulation failure are the early signs of transformer failures. The RNN component concentrates on the data generated by sensors and meters in real-time environment. This helps to predict the future demand for power transformers. The sequential patterns are obtained through the LS TM component. They provide accurate details regarding the performance and life of transformers. The integration of energy management with predictive maintenance helps optimise power utility while maintaining the reliable operation of transformers."

Technological advances like ADAS and AI in cars present societal challenges and opportunities. It shows how AI aids human-machine communication by improving motor skills. The auto industry is interested in ADAS because it can increase energy efficiency, safety, and comfort. Numerous studies have shown its benefits. ADAS and vehicle networking show promise, but establishing a sound control system is challenging. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is one answer to these problems. To manage higher-level connectivity and automation, the paper analyses and implements key research. It also finds issues and recommends solutions. The latest driverless car ADAS improvements have dramatically increased passenger safety. These systems are safer and more automated using sensors and ECUs. Most ADAS have RADAR, cameras, ultrasonic, and LiDAR. This work uses AI/ML-enabled Predictive Maintenance modelling to improve ADAS safety and longevity. AI and ML in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are significant vehicle safety and reliability advances. AI/ML-enabled predictive maintenance detects and fixes ADAS component faults. ADAS predictive maintenance using AI/ML can detect issues, improve driver safety, and boost vehicle efficiency. Advanced sensor arrays and control units are needed for adaptive cruise control, traffic sign recognition, and lane-keeping assistance. AI/ML algorithms discover issues and enable early interventions in predictive maintenance models.

      "abstract": "Battery management systems (BMS) are essential in the fast developing IIoT domain for guaranteeing the efficiency, lifetime, and dependability of energy storage solutions. With the proliferation of IIoT devices across many industries, there is a growing need for sophisticated BMS systems that can optimise energy usage, anticipate battery performance, and enable intelligent maintenance. Improvements in energy efficiency, predictive analytics, and intelligent maintenance approaches are the primary foci of this research as it pertains to the IIoT ecosystem and BMS. Our first step is to investigate ways that IIoT devices can be made more energy efficient. This includes things like optimising the charging and discharging operations of batteries and using adaptive power management techniques. We want to keep IIoT devices running longer and lessen their impact on the environment by making the most of BMS\u2019s energy efficiency. Our second topic is the function of predictive analytics in predicting the state of a battery\u2019s health and output. Models are created using machine learning algorithms and big data analytics to forecast battery deterioration patterns, identify impending failures, and plan proactive maintenance to reduce maintenance expenses and downtime. We conclude by exploring intelligent maintenance approaches that can deliver BMS valuable insights through the use of real-time data and advanced analytics. A combination of these methods\u2014which include automated maintenance procedures, remote monitoring, and self-diagnostic devices\u2014improves the performance and dependability of IIoT battery systems. This paper examines the present and future of BMS in the IIoT through a thorough literature analysis, case studies, and experimental validation. The insights it provides are quite significant. In light of these results, data-driven methods have the ability to transform battery management, guaranteeing that IIoT devices can continue to withstand the increasing demands of industry while being environmentally friendly, efficient, and robust."

      "abstract": "This research paper introduces the Box Plot model for the fault detection and degradation analysis in solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. The suggested method contains a mathematics equation and systematic flowchart algorithm to detect and categorize various fault types, such as direct current (DC) ground fault, DC overvoltage fault, and partial shading. The technique evaluates and monitors the performance and degradation of PV panel by processing comprehensive input data such as voltage, current, irradiance, temperature, power, solar PV systems related data and PV panel parameter data. The Box Plot model efficiently monitors fault analysis and degradation detection, adapting to various operational conditions with accuracy, resulting in a powerful tool for assessing the reliability and performance of solar PV systems. The Box Plot model is tested by using the three sets of the solar PV power plant collected data from the PV panel strings in the same array that nearby each other and verifying the Box Plot model effectiveness by comparing the model analysis result with the solar PV power plant operation and maintenance report. This methodology makes a major contribution to predictive maintenance operations and ensuring more reliability for the PV systems."

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Predictive Maintenance (PdM) solutions can predict and consequently minimize downtimes. Concerning high implementation cost of PdM solutions for manufacturing systems as well as for sold systems operating in the field, e.g. Building Energy Systems in residential heating (RH), it is unclear under which conditions potentials outweigh investment. In a previous scientific publication, the authors proposed a methodology to systematically assess potentials and benefits of to-be-developed PdM solutions in manufacturing processes. The utilization of the methodology for RH systems is promising, but requires a suitable adaptation to its individual context. Apart from quantifying the benefit compared to investment for PdM solutions, the context of RH is fundamentally different from manufacturing. As a major difference, the systems are not located in-house, but in the field at the customers\u2019 site. This leads to increased challenges in terms of lacking customer and system feedback and data availability. Therefore, this paper addresses the optimization, transfer, and adaptation of the previously developed methodology to RH systems. Additionally, this paper includes baseline information regarding maintenance and RH and an exemplary application of the optimized and adapted methodology that supports the reliability department of BOSCH Thermotechnology for quantifying the potentials of PdM solutions in the field of RH."

      "abstract": "Nowadays, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) plays a more and more significant role in smart manufacturing. Predictive Maintenance (PdM) is one of the essential applications, recognizing the current status of the machine and preventing disastrous breakdowns. End-point sensors for such monitoring systems are powered mainly by batteries. As IIoT grows, constantly replacing batteries across thousands of devices is cost-prohibitive. In addition, tremendous original sensing data are wirelessly transmitted to the server for data analysis, causing colossal energy consumption. In this paper, we propose the first self-powered on-device PdM system based on piezoelectric energy harvesting and tiny machine learning (Tiny ML). A trained TinyML model is deployed on the low-cost microcontroller (MCU) for on-device inferring; only the diagnosis result is transmitted. With an emphasis on ultra-low-power demands, a piezoelectric energy harvester is utilized as an energy source and self-powered sensor (SPS) simultaneously. The energy-aware circuit provides reconfigurable on/off threshold voltages for efficient and robust intermittent operation. The balance between energy supply and demand in the battery-free system has been achieved by a handy design. A rich SPS dataset has been collected in a simulated vibration environment and analyzed by five well-known machine-learning models. Random forest stands out given ultra-small data length and sampling rate with accuracy up to 99% for four-class similar vibration diagnosis. Lab test validates the feasibility and performance. As a cyber-electro-mechanical co-design, the system provides a promising solution to the ubiquitous artificial intelligence of things (AIoT)."

      "abstract": "Buildings\u2019 heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems account for significant global energy use. Proper maintenance can minimize their environmental footprint and enhance the quality of the indoor environment. The adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors integrated into HVAC systems has paved the way for predictive maintenance (PdM) grounded in real-time operational metrics. However, HVAC systems without such sensors cannot leverage the advantages of current data-driven PdM techniques. This work introduces a novel data-driven framework, the health prognostics classification with autoencoders (HPC-AE), designed specifically for PdM. It utilizes solely HVAC power consumption and outside temperature readings for its operations, both of which are readily obtainable. The primary objective of the HPC-AE framework is to facilitate PdM through a health prognostic approach. The HPC-AE framework utilizes an autoencoder for feature enrichment and then applies an artificial neural network to classify the daily health condition of an HVAC system. A multi-objective evaluation metric is employed to ensure optimal performance of the autoencoder within this framework. This metric evaluates the autoencoder\u2019s proficiency in reducing reconstruction discrepancies in standard data conditions and its capability to differentiate between standard and degraded data scenarios. The HPC-AE framework is validated in two HVAC fault scenarios, including a clogged air filter and air duct leakage. The experimental results show that compared to methods used in similar studies, HPC-AE exhibits a 5.7% and 2.1% increase in the F1 score for the clogged air filter and duct leakage scenarios."

      "abstract": "Dry power transformers are a critical component of microgrids, but their diagnostic can be challenging due to the various types of defects that can occur. This paper proposes several monitoring techniques to predict these defects and improve the diagnostic of dry power transformers in microgrids. One of the key features of this approach is the use of thermal image classification to detect the number of short circuits in the power transformer. The classification of thermal images is performed using the transfer learning method, which allows for the utilization of pre-trained models and the adaptation of them to the specific task at hand. This feature is integrated into a larger smart energy management system for microgrids, which aims to optimize the operation and maintenance of these systems. The proposed techniques have been tested and validated through experiments, and the results demonstrate their effectiveness in accurately predicting defects and improving the diagnostic of dry power transformers in microgrids."

      "abstract": "Power transformers are a fundamental component of the modern power distribution network. The fault-free operation of step-up and step-down transformers is of prime importance to the continuous supply of electrical energy to the consumers. To ensure such efficient operation, power distribution companies carry out routine maintenance of distribution transformers through preplanned schedules. The efficacy of such maintenance depends on a proper understanding of the transformer and its components and efficient prediction of faults in these components. There are several components whose condition can be studied to predict transformer failures and therefore the overall health of a transformer. These include transformer windings, insulations, transformer oil, core insulations, and ferromagnetic cores. This work develops a new, simplified fuzzy logic\u2013based method to predict the health of a transformer by taking into account the state of several individual components. Case studies are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the developed method."

      "abstract": "The widespread adoption of cyber-physical systems and other cutting-edge digital technology in manufacturing industry production facilities may motivate stakeholders to embrace the idea of Industry 4.0. Some industrial companies already have different sensors installed on their machines; however, without proper analysis, the data collected is not useful. This systematic review\u2019s main goal is to synthesize the existing evidence on the application of predictive maintenance (PdM) with visual aids and to identify the key knowledge gaps in areas including utilities, power generation, industry, and energy consumption. After a thorough search and evaluation for relevancy, 37 documents were identified. Moreover, we identified the visual analytics of PdM, including anomaly detection, planning/scheduling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). The findings revealed that anomaly detection was a major domain in PdM-related works. We conclude that most of the literature lacks depth in terms of an overall framework that combines data-driven and knowledge-driven techniques of PdM in the manufacturing industry. Some works that utilized both techniques indicated promising results, but there is insufficient research on involving maintenance personnel\u2019s feedback in the latter stage of PdM architecture. Thus, there are still pertinent issues that need to be investigated, and limitations that need to be overcome before PdM is deployed with minimal human involvement."

These changes are beginning to considerably strain the transmission and distribution infrastructure. Utilities are increasingly recognizing that the integration of energy storage in the grid infrastructure will help manage intermittency and improve grid reliability. This recognition, coupled with the proliferation of state-level renewable portfolio standards and rapidly declining lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery costs, has led to a surge in the deployment of battery energy storage systems (BESSs).

Selecting the proper communication protocol in microservices is critical to achieving optimal system performance. This study compares the performance of three commonly used API protocols: REST, GraphQL, and gRPC, in microservices architecture. In this study, we established three microservices implemented in three containers and each microservice contained a Redis and MySQL database. We evaluated the performance of these API protocols using two key performance metrics: response time and CPU Utilization. This study performs two distinct data retrieval: fetching flat data and fetching nested data, with a number of requests ranging from 100 to 500 requests. The experimental results indicate that gRPC has a faster response time, followed by REST and GraphQL. Moreover, GraphQL shows higher CPU Utilization compared to gRPC and REST. The experimental results provide insight for developers and architects seeking to optimize their microservices communication protocols for specific use cases and workloads."

A WBAN may be either an inter-WBAN or an intra-WBAN network. Intra-WBAN communication occurs when the various body sensors can share information. This is known as inter-WBAN communication, which occurs when two or more WBANs can exchange data with one another. One difficulty involves getting data traffic from wireless sensor nodes to the gateway with as little wasted energy, dropped packets, and downtime as possible. In this paper, the WBAN protocols have been compared with WBAN under Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and the performance of various parameters has been analysed for different simulation areas. The WBAN under the PSO protocol reduces the energy consumption by 43.2% against the SIMPLE protocoldue to the effective selection of forwarding nodes based on PSO optimization. In addition to that the experimental WBAN testbed is conducted in indoor environment to study the performance of the routing metrics towards energy and packet reception.."

When infrastructure support is not available, data travels along a multi-hop routing path to the destination, and a routing protocol is needed to find these paths. In this work, we evaluate one commonly used protocol, BATMAN-adv, on commercially available Wi-Fi chipsets in embedded systems. We find that BATMAN-adv can form the desired routing paths, but the efficiency can be improved. In particular, this protocol does not consider traffic from other sources, and may lead to crowded paths. In addition, TCP works mostly well on the found routing paths, and its performance is comparable to UDP, but its built-in resource allocation mechanism may not meet an application's need. Consequently, both routing protocols and transport layer protocol should be revised to better suit convergecast applications."

      "abstract": "The safety of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) relies on the reliable and efficient raw data sharing from multiple types of sensors. The 5G millimeter wave (mmWave) communication technology can enhance the environment sensing ability of different isolated vehicles. In this paper, a joint sensing and communication integrated system (JSCIS) is designed to support the dynamic frame structure configuration for sensing and communication dual functions based on the 5G New Radio protocol in the mmWave frequency band, which can solve the low latency and high data rate problems of raw sensing data sharing among CAVs. To evaluate the timeliness of raw sensing data transmission, the best time duration allocation ratio of sensing and communication dual functions for one vehicle is achieved by modeling the <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$M/M/1$</tex-math></inline-formula> queuing problem using the age of information (AoI) in this paper. Furthermore, the resource allocation optimization problem among multiple CAVs is formulated as a non-cooperative game using the radar mutual information as a key indicator. And the feasibility and existence of pure strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) are proved theoretically, and a centralized time resource allocation (CTRA) algorithm is proposed to achieve the best feasible pure strategy NE. Finally, both simulation and hardware testbed are designed, and the results show that the proposed CTRA algorithm can improve the radar total mutual information by 26<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula>, and the feasibility of the proposed JSCIS is achieved with an acceptable radar ranging accuracy within <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\pm$</tex-math></inline-formula> 0.25\u00a0m, as well as a stable data rate of 2.8\u00a0Gbps using the 28\u00a0GHz mmWave frequency band."

The mobile nodes in MANETs are randomly connected and their location and functioning keeps on changing based on the situation and network application requirement. However, the nodes in MANETs are battery powered which is one of the limiting factors in their performance. However, seamless and longer duration connectivity depends upon the lifetime of individual nodes. The power consumption during transmission is the critical design issue in MANET's. This work involves the performance evaluation of a designed MANET scenario with variation in transmission power using Ad-hoc On-Demand Multipath Distance Vector (AOMDV) Routing Protocol (RP) at variable node configuration. The performance of designed MANET scenario is evaluated using several qualitative performance metrics for optimum performance using QualNet simulator."

The vehicles are connecting in an ad hoc manner to create a network of a wider range. In an intelligent transport system (ITS), with vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication in the VANET is used to support the network backbone and which the accident prevention technique has been deployed for ensuring the road safety. The major reason for the road accident is the abnormal driving behavior of human drivers. The movement pattern of the vehicle is the main factor of the network topology so that the impact of human driving pattern influences the performance and behavior of the network. Driving behavior can be classified as reckless, normal, drunken, and fatigue driving. During driving, the behavior of human drivers was predicted in this paper, thereby providing the performance analysis on the mobility of the network. For the improvement of a driver behavior, the hybridized mega\u2010trend diffusion (MTD) with optimized deep belief network\u2013sunflower optimization (DBN\u2010SFO) is used. Here, the network performance of the adaptive deer hunting Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (ADHOLSR) is analyzed in NS2 simulation platform."

It is a low-power standard developed for wireless body area networks and enables wireless communication inside or near a human body. This standard utilizes a Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol to improve network performance under different channel access priorities. However, the CSMA/CA proposed in the IEEE 802.15.6 standard has poor throughput performance and link reliability when some of the nodes deployed on a human body are hidden from each other. We employ the RTS/CTS scheme to solve hidden node problems in IEEE 802.15.6 networks over a lossy channel. To improve performance of the RTS/CTS scheme, we adjust transmission power levels of the nodes according to transmission failures. We estimate throughput and energy consumption of the proposed model by differentiating several parameters, such as contention window size, values of bit error ratios, number of nodes in different priority classes. The performance results are obtained through analytical approximations and simulations. We observe that the proposed model significantly improves performance of the IEEE 802.15.6 CSMA/CA by resolving hidden node problems."

IPv6-enabled 6LoWPAN is a low-power, low-range communication protocol designed and developed for the short-range IoT applications. 6LoWPAN is based on IEEE 802.15.4 protocol and IPv6 network protocol for low range wireless applications. Although 6LoWPAN supports different routing protocols, RPL is the widely used routing protocol for low power and lossy networks. In this work, we have taken an IoT enabled smart home environment, in which 6LoWPAN is used as a communication and RPL as a routing protocol. The performance of this proposed network model is analyzed based on the different performance metrics such as latency, PDR, and throughput. The proposed model is simulated using Cooja simulator running over the Contiki OS. Along with the Cooja simulator, the network analyzer tool Wireshark is used to analyze the network behaviors."

      "abstract": "Recent days witnessed considerable developments in the field of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The applications of these networks can be seen in the simple consumer electronic devices as well as in the advanced space technology. The communication protocols are of prior importance and interest; the low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) protocol is used to enhance the performance of power consumption for the WSNs nodes. The efficiency of a wireless network can be affected by different factors, such as the size of the WSN and the initial energy of the sensor node. This can inspire the researchers to develop the optimum structure of the WSNs to get its desired functionality. In this paper, the performance of the low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) protocol is investigated using MATLAB to study the effect of the initial energy of the sensor node and the WSN size on the number of the running nodes. It is found that increasing the initial energy of a sensor node increases the life time of the node and hence the number of the running nodes. It has been also approved that the WSN size has an inverse proportion with the number of running sensor nodes during the use of LEACH protocol."

It stands as one of the most popular technologies for the following years and it is requiring substantial changes in the Internet protocols to meet its requirements. As the application layer is decisive for the quality of the connection, this paper analyzes the performance offered by one of the most popular protocols for the application layer in IoT: the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). This analysis aims to examine the features and capabilities of this protocol and to determine its feasibility to operate under constrained devices using security support. For this, a realistic network scenario is deployed to run the simulations and to measure bandwidth, consumption of resources (i.e., CPU cycles and bandwidth usage) and communication latency. Additionally, the trade-off between security and performance is discussed measuring the bandwidth overhead and the consumption increase associated to secure the communications. Different ciphering and authentication algorithms are tested, following the recommendations made by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)."

      "abstract": "Automobile industry is rapidly growing with new technologies. One of such prominent technologies is communication and network connectivity. New era smart vehicles are coming equipped with network adaptors for data connectivity. Modern smart vehicles are aided with hundreds or sensors and manufactures are working on making all sensors and driving statistics to make available to centralized cloud servers for different applications using IoT and cloud technologies making Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Even manufactures are working on some advance features like actuator control and vehicle control and telemetry using data network infrastructure. This work is focused on a proposed novel vehicular protocol data unit (VPDU) and its complete layered network stack implementation framework for vehicle to everything (V2X) communication in an urban scenario. For validation of network framework and evaluation of performance matrices, the simulated vehicular area network (VAN) is proposed in an urban scenario using complete network stack and terrain data in QualNet\u00ae simulator. Two industry standard MAC protocols as IEEE 802.11a and 802.11p. AODV, Bellman-Ford and OSPFv2 are used as routing protocols to analyze the network performance for all test cases. IEEE 802.11p MAC shows significant performance improvements from 802.11a counterparts with the proposed novel VPDU in a typical urban VAN scenario. The IEEE 802.11p MAC outperforms 802.11a with 11% less overall End-to-End delay, 29% overall less average jitter and overall 127% increase in packet delivery ratio (PDR). AODV routing protocol performs the best with minimum latency and packet error by improving PDR. The detailed performance analysis is presented in the scope of the paper."

Currently, most of the information regarding the scalability of the LoRa technology is commercial and deals with the best-case scenario. Thus, we need realistic models, enabling the proper assessment of the performance level. Most of the time, the IoT concept entails a large number of nodes distributed over a wide geographical area, therefore forming a high density, large-scale architecture. It is important to determine the number of collisions so that we can assess the network performance. The present paper aims at assessing the performance level of the LoRaWAN technology by analyzing the number of packet collisions that can occur. Thus, this paper determines the maximum number of LoRa nodes that can communicate with a Gateway considering the LoRaWAN protocol specifications. Furthermore, we have proposed a series of solutions for reducing the number of collisions and increasing the capacity of the communication channel."

The sensor node drifting along with ocean current offers 4D (space and time) monitoring for real-time underwater application. However, the main challenge arises from the underwater acoustic communication that results in high propagation delay, packet loss and overhead in the network. In order to overcome these issues, a depth adjustment and void aware pressure routing protocol is proposed for UWSN. A greedy forwarding strategy is used to forward the packet. In case a node fails to forward the packet using greedy forwarding strategy, then it immediately switches to the recovery mode. In the recovery mode, the node determines the new depth using particle swarm optimization technique. The global best value gives the new depth with minimum displacement. The void node forwards the packet with minimum displacement without any packet loss and delay."

      "abstract": "The increasing demand for Internet of Things (IoT) applications has resulted in vast amounts of data, requiring the utilization of big data analytics. The integration of big data analytics in IoT-based smart cities can greatly benefit from the development of wireless communication protocols, among which the Thread protocol has emerged as a promising option. Thread is IEEE 802.15.4 based and has advanced capabilities like mesh networking, IPv6 support, and multiple gateways providing no single point of failure. This paper presents the design and evaluation of a low-cost mesh network using Raspberry Pi, nRF52840 dongle, and OpenThread 1.2 (i.e., an open-source software implementation of the Thread protocol stack). The research elaborates on the hardware and software solutions used, as well as the network topologies adopted. To evaluate the performance of the developed system, extensive real-time tests are performed, considering parameters, such as jitter, packet loss, and round trip time. These tests effectively demonstrate the effectiveness of the Thread network. Furthermore, the impact of varying payload size and bitrate on the network is analyzed to understand its influence. The behavior of the multi-hop network is also examined under link failure scenarios, providing insights into the network\u2019s robustness. Our findings provide valuable insights for researchers interested in designing low-cost and efficient mesh networks for various IoT applications, including home automation, building/campus monitoring systems, distributed industrial IoT applications, and smart city infrastructure."

Real-time communication, facilitated by streaming media protocols, utilizes peer-to-peer or client-server models to enhance Quality of Service (QoS). WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) stands as a widely adopted, browser-based, open-source, peer-to-peer protocol, offering real-time media transmission through JavaScript APIs without third-party plugins. This paper presents an in-depth performance evaluation of a WebRTC-based video conferencing system using Socket.io services on a Node.js server. Our research expands on recent studies by introducing a comprehensive set of performance parameters, including Processing delay, CPU Utilization, Latency, Jitter, and Packet Loss, and packet delay. Our findings indicate that WebRTC performs exceptionally well within specific latency thresholds. However, scalability concerns emerge when a large number of clients are introduced, especially in bandwidth-constrained environments."

      "abstract": "Thread is a wireless networking protocol based on existing open standards such as IEEE 802.15.4, 6LoWPAN, and IPv6, and is designed for low power, low data rate and short-range applications. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of Thread protocol for lighting systems using a practical testbed setup in an office area. We focus our evaluation on unicast and multicast, which are the two most important communication paradigms for lighting applications. The unicast and multicast of Thread are tested under various communication parameters, such as concurrent multicast sources, hop distance from the source to the destination, communication interval, etc. The key performance indicators include end-to-end latency, time for complete coverage, synchronization, and packet delivery ratio. In addition, we use the measurement results of unicast and multicast in some typical lighting applications to analyze its impact on user experience. Through our extensive experiment and analysis, we conclude that the performance of Thread multicast and unicast has much leeway to meet the requirements of lighting systems."

      "abstract": "Now-a-days, e-health and healthcare applications in the internet of things are growing rapidly. These applications are starting from remote monitoring of patient's parameters in home to monitoring patients during his life activities at work, transportation, etc. So we can monitor patients at any place outside of hospitals and clinical settings. By using this technology, we can save lives and reduce the number of emergency visits to hospitals. In contemporary time, there are great progress and opportunities for the internet of things (IoT) related E-health systems. Most IoT e-health platforms consist of three main parts; client nodes (patient or doctor), IoT server and IoT communication messaging protocol. One of E-health systems design over IoT challenge is choosing the most suitable IoT messaging protocol for E-health applications. In this paper, IoT remote patient and e-Health monitoring system was designed for monitoring physiological medical signals of patients based on most two famous IoT messaging protocols, MQTT and CoAP. These medical signals can be include parameters like heart rate signals, electro-cardio graph (ECG), patient temperature, blood pressure, etc. This practical comparison between CoAP and MQTT is to choose most suitable for e-health systems. The proposed approach was evaluated based on most significant protocol parameters like capability, efficiency, communication method and message delay. Practical and simulation results show the performance of the proposed E-health systems over IoT for different network infrastructure with different losses percentages."

However, since it is limited to TCP at transport layer, it is not possible to run MQTT over UDP, which would be desirable for real-time capable publish/subscribe. MQTT for Sensor Networks (MQTT-SN), which is a lightweight version of MQTT, allows the use of UDP, however, is strongly coupled to MQTT by the current specification and cannot be operated independently of it. In this work, we therefore propose a standalone broker implementation of MQTT-SN. In initial measurements, we can show that our approach is much more performant than the approach described in the specification and that our implementation compares very well with the protocols CoAP Pub/Sub and MOTT."

This emerging form of networking is construct of flying nodes known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that fly at a fast rate of speed, causing frequent changes in the network topology and connection failures. As a result, there is no dedicated FANET routing protocol that enables effective communication between these devices. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the performance of the category of topology-based routing protocols in the FANET. In a surveillance system involving video traffic, four routing protocols with varying routing mechanisms were examined. Additionally, simulation experiments conducted to determine the influence of flying altitude. The results indicate that hybrid routing protocols outperform other types of protocols in terms of average throughput. Proactive protocols, on the other hand, have the least jitter."

      "abstract": "The Internet of Drones (IoD) is a networking architecture that stems from the interplay between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and wireless communication technologies. Networked drones can unleash disruptive scenarios in many application domains. At the same time, to really capitalize on their potential, accurate modeling techniques are required to seize the fine details that characterize the features and limitations of UAVs, wireless communications, and networking protocols. To this end, the present contribution proposes the IoD simulator (IoD-Sim), a comprehensive and versatile open source tool that addresses the many facets of the IoD. IoD-Sim is a network simulator 3 (ns-3)-based simulator organized into a 3-layer stack, composed of: 1) the Underlying Platform, which provides the telecommunication primitives for different standardized protocol stacks; 2) the Core, that implements all the fundamental features of an IoD scenario; and 3) the Simulation Development Platform, mainly composed of a set of tools that speeds up the graphical design for every possible use case. In order to prove the huge potential of this proposal, three different scenarios are presented and analyzed from both a software perspective and a telecommunications standpoint. The peculiarities of this open-source tool are of interest for researchers in academia, as they will be able to extend it to model upcoming specifications, including, but not limited to, mobile and satellite communications. Still, it will certainly be of relevance in industry to accelerate the design phase, thus reducing the time to market of IoD-based services."
