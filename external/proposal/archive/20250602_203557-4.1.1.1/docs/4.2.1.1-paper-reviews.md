# Paper Review Results (Task 4.2.1.1)

## Overview
This document summarizes the results of reviewing papers from two sources:
1. Elicit search results (`sources/4.1-semantic-search/elicit-results/elicit-review-papers`)
2. Semantic Scholar search results (`sources/4.1-semantic-search/semantic-scholar-search-iteration-1/semantic-scholar-review-papers`)

## Review Criteria
The papers were evaluated based on three main categories:
1. Protocol Focus
2. Domain Context
3. Technical Requirements

Each category contains Must Have, Should Have, and Nice to Have criteria, with corresponding point values.

## Results Summary

### Elicit Papers (25 papers)
- Primary (Highly Relevant): 0 papers
- Secondary (Moderately Relevant): 1 paper
- Tertiary (Minimally Relevant): 0 papers
- Not Relevant: 24 papers

Most relevant paper:
- "Modeling and Coordination of interconnected microgrids using distributed artificial intelligence approaches"
- Score: 31/54
- Category Scores: Protocol Focus (9), Domain Context (11), Technical Requirements (11)
- Level: Secondary (Moderately Relevant)

### Semantic Scholar Papers (29 papers)
- Primary (Highly Relevant): 0 papers
- Secondary (Moderately Relevant): 0 papers
- Tertiary (Minimally Relevant): 2 papers
- Not Relevant: 27 papers

Most relevant papers:
1. "Device Agent Assisted Blockchain Leveraged Framework for Internet of Things"
   - Score: 32/54
   - Category Scores: Protocol Focus (10), Domain Context (12), Technical Requirements (10)
   - Level: Tertiary (Minimally Relevant)

2. "Performance evaluation of wireless sensor networks using LEACH protocol"
   - Score: 22/54
   - Category Scores: Protocol Focus (8), Domain Context (7), Technical Requirements (7)
   - Level: Not Relevant

## Key Findings
1. Very few papers meet our relevance criteria
2. Most papers focus on general DER coordination or specific applications rather than agent communication protocols
3. The highest scoring papers are still below the threshold for "Primary (Highly Relevant)" status

## Next Steps
1. Refine search criteria to be more specific about agent communication protocols
2. Consider expanding search to include more recent papers
3. Look for papers that specifically focus on ACP/A2A in the context of DER maintenance
