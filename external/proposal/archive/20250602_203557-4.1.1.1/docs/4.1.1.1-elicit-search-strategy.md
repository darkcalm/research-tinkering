# Elicit.com Search Strategy (Task 4.1.1.1)

## Elicit.com Best Practices

1. **Query Structure**
   - Use natural language questions
   - Be specific about the domain and context
   - Include key technical terms
   - Specify time period if relevant
   - Mention specific technologies or protocols

2. **Search Optimization**
   - Start with broad questions
   - Refine based on initial results
   - Use follow-up questions for specific aspects
   - Combine multiple related questions
   - Use Elicit's question suggestions

3. **Results Analysis**
   - Review paper summaries
   - Check methodology relevance
   - Assess paper quality

   - Identify gaps
   - Adjust query as needed
   - Focus on recent papers (2018-2024)

3. **Documentation**
   - Record search query
   - Document results
   - Note paper relevance
   - Track search iterations

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Primary Papers**
