## Feasibility Considerations Summary

- **Highly Recommended Methodologies** are those with strong alignment across suitability, resource manageability, risk profile, and timeline.
- **Feasible with Conditions** methodologies may require specific strategies to mitigate identified inhibitors (e.g., securing specific resources, careful risk management).
- **Low Feasibility** or **Not Recommended** methodologies present significant challenges within the defined research context and constraints, often due to high resource needs, excessive risks, or poor timeline fit for a 20-week individual Master's thesis.

## Next Steps
