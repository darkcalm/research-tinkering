*Generated: 2025-01-01*

## Summary

All FA1 (Formative Assignment 1) components have been successfully drafted and integrated into the LaTeX template.

## Components Completed

### 1. Background Section (Task 4.5.1)
- **Introduction**: Global energy transformation, DER proliferation, predictive maintenance challenges
- **Problem Context**: Multi-stakeholder complexity, communication limitations, technical requirements
- **Literature Review**: Agent-based approaches, protocol development, performance considerations, standards
- **Research Gap Identification**: Protocol adaptation gap, implementation-practice gap, evaluation methodology gap
- **Citations**: 10 key references integrated with BibTeX

### 2. Research Questions (Task 4.5.2)
- **Overall Aim**: Clear statement of research purpose
- **Specific Objectives**: Five measurable objectives aligned with research activities
- **Primary Research Question**: Comprehensive question addressing protocol application and evaluation
- **Sub-Questions**: Three focused questions guiding the research

### 3. Scope and Limitations (Task 4.5.3)
- **Scope Parameters**: 
  - Protocol focus (ACP and A2A)
  - Use case specificity (predictive maintenance)
  - Quantitative framework development
  - Analysis approach
- **Key Limitations**: Time constraints, limited validation, protocol scope, generalization, security depth, data access
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Clear documentation and focus on high-impact aspects

### 4. Additional FA1 Requirements
- **Preliminary Methodology Considerations**: Added section discussing proposed mixed-methods approach and alternative methodologies considered
- **Theoretical Framework Placeholder**: Section included for future development

## Document Structure

The FA1 submission includes:
1. Title page with abstract placeholder
2. Table of contents
3. Introduction and Background (~1,600 words)
4. Research Objectives and Questions (~400 words)
5. Scope and Limitations (~600 words)
6. Preliminary Methodology Considerations (~300 words)
7. References (10 citations)

**Total word count: ~2,900 words** (within the 3,000-word extended limit)

## Technical Updates

### LaTeX Template Modifications
- Removed `fontspec` dependency (was causing XeTeX requirement)
- Switched to `mathpazo` font for Palatino
- Added `microtype` for better typography
- Fixed em-dash formatting (using `---`)
- Updated bibliography handling with `biber` backend

### Compilation Instructions
```bash
cd deliverables
pdflatex main.tex
biber main
pdflatex main.tex
pdflatex main.tex  # Run twice more for cross-references
```

## Key Deliverables Created

1. **LaTeX Files**:
   - `deliverables/main.tex` - Updated with all FA1 content
   - `deliverables/ref.bib` - Bibliography with 10 references

2. **Documentation**:
   - `docs/4.5.1-background-section.tex` - Standalone background section
   - `docs/4.5.1-bibliography.bib` - Bibliography entries
   - `docs/4.5.2-3-objectives-scope.tex` - Objectives and scope sections
   - `docs/4.5.1-background-section-summary.md` - Background summary
   - `docs/4.5.2-3-objectives-scope-summary.md` - Objectives/scope summary

3. **Scripts**:
   - `tools/4.5.1_draft_background_section.py` - Background generation script
   - `tools/4.5.2-3_draft_questions_scope.py` - Objectives/scope generation script

## FA1 Requirements Met

According to the grading criteria, FA1 should include:
- ✓ Background submission
- ✓ Discussion and motivation of objective/research question
- ✓ Scope/limitations
- ✓ Discussion of possible methodologies (preliminary section added)

## Next Steps

1. **Task 4.5.4**: Review against requirements (quality check)
2. **Task 4.5.5**: Submit by April 16 deadline
3. **Future FA2**: Will need to expand methodology section and address uncertainties/risks
