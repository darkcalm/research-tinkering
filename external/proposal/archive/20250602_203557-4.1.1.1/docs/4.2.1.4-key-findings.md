### Semantic Scholar
- Not Relevant: 27 papers
- Tertiary (Minimally Relevant): 2 papers

## Research Gaps Identified
1. **Lack of Focus on Agent Communication Protocols**
   - Most papers focus on general DER coordination
   - Limited research on ACP/A2A specifically for DER maintenance
   - No papers reach 'Primary (Highly Relevant)' status

2. **Theoretical Gaps**
   - Limited formalization of agent communication protocols for DER maintenance
   - Lack of standardized approaches for multi-owner scenarios
   - Insufficient focus on security and privacy in agent communication

3. **Methodological Gaps**
   - Few papers provide detailed protocol specifications
   - Limited evaluation of protocol performance in real-world scenarios
   - Lack of comprehensive testing frameworks for agent communication

4. **Practical Gaps**
   - Limited implementation examples of agent communication protocols
   - Few papers address integration with existing DER systems
   - Insufficient focus on scalability and interoperability

## Implications for Research
1. The identified gaps highlight the need for:
   - Development of formal agent communication protocols for DER maintenance
   - Research on secure and scalable communication mechanisms
   - Standardization of approaches for multi-owner scenarios
   - Practical implementation and testing frameworks

2. These gaps present opportunities for:
   - Novel protocol design and implementation
   - Integration of security and privacy considerations
   - Development of testing and validation methodologies
   - Creation of practical guidelines for implementation
