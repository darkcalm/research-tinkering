# Primary Search Query Development (Task 4.1.1.2)

## Query Analysis

### Core Components
1. **Protocol Focus**
   - Agent Communication Protocols
   - Multi-agent Systems
   - Distributed Communication
   - Protocol Adaptation

2. **Domain Context**
   - Distributed Energy Resources
   - Predictive Maintenance
   - Multi-owner Systems
   - Energy Sector

3. **Technical Requirements**
   - Security
   - Scalability
   - Interoperability
   - Coordination

## Query Development Strategy

### 1. Component Breakdown
To find relevant papers, we need to consider:
- Papers about agent communication in distributed systems
- Research on DER maintenance coordination
- Studies on protocol adaptation for specific domains
- Work on secure and scalable communication in energy systems

### 2. Query Variations

#### Primary Query (Broad)
```
How are agent communication protocols adapted for secure and scalable communication in distributed energy systems?
```

#### Alternative Query (Specific)
```
What are the challenges and solutions for implementing secure agent-based communication in multi-owner distributed energy resource management?
```

#### Technical Query
```
How can distributed communication protocols be adapted to ensure security and scalability in predictive maintenance coordination?
```

### 3. Search Terms to Include
- "agent communication protocol"
- "distributed energy resources"
- "predictive maintenance"
- "multi-agent systems"
- "protocol adaptation"
- "secure communication"
- "scalable coordination"
- "interoperability"

### 4. Search Terms to Exclude
- "blockchain" (unless specifically about communication)
- "IoT" (too broad)
- "smart grid" (unless about DER coordination)
- "machine learning" (unless about protocol adaptation)

## Query Refinement Process

1. **Initial Search**
   - Use the broad query first
   - Review top 20 results
   - Identify relevant papers
   - Note common themes and terminology

2. **Query Adjustment**
   - Add specific terms based on initial results
   - Remove overly broad terms
   - Focus on recent papers (2018-2024)
   - Consider related domains

3. **Validation**
   - Check if results include:
     - Protocol adaptation papers
     - DER maintenance studies
     - Security implementations
     - Scalability solutions

## Final Primary Query

```
How are agent communication protocols adapted and implemented for secure, scalable coordination in distributed energy resource maintenance?
```

### Rationale
1. **Scope**
   - Focuses on protocol adaptation
   - Includes security and scalability
   - Covers coordination aspects
   - Maintains energy domain context

2. **Expected Results**
   - Papers on protocol adaptation
   - Studies on secure communication
   - Research on scalable coordination
   - DER maintenance approaches

3. **Search Strategy**
   - Start with this query
   - Review results for terminology
   - Adjust based on findings
   - Focus on recent papers

## Next Steps

1. Execute search with final query
2. Document initial results
3. Analyze paper relevance
4. Adjust query if needed
5. Prepare for results documentation
