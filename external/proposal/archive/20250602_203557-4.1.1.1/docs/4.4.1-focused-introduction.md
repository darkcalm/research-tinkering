## Introduction

The global energy sector is undergoing a fundamental transformation driven by the urgent need to decarbonize and create more resilient, sustainable energy systems. Central to this transition is the rapid deployment of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs)—including rooftop solar panels, battery storage systems, electric vehicles, and smart inverters—which are fundamentally reshaping how electricity is generated, stored, and consumed (Hirsch et al., 2018; IRENA, 2019). By 2030, the installed capacity of distributed solar photovoltaics alone is projected to exceed 5,400 GW globally, representing a tenfold increase from 2020 levels (IEA, 2021).

This unprecedented proliferation of DERs presents both opportunities and challenges for modern power systems. While DERs offer significant benefits—including reduced transmission losses, enhanced grid resilience, and democratized energy access—their integration introduces substantial complexity in grid management and coordination (Eid et al., 2016; Parag & Sovacool, 2016). Unlike traditional centralized power generation, DERs are characterized by their geographic dispersion, diverse ownership structures, heterogeneous technologies, and variable output patterns. These characteristics fundamentally challenge conventional approaches to grid operation and maintenance, which were designed for unidirectional power flows and centralized control architectures.

A critical yet underexplored aspect of DER integration is the coordination of predictive maintenance across diverse, multi-owner DER fleets. Effective maintenance is essential for ensuring the reliability, efficiency, and longevity of DER assets, directly impacting their economic viability and contribution to grid stability (Jafari et al., 2020). However, the decentralized nature of DER ownership—spanning individual homeowners, commercial entities, community energy cooperatives, and third-party aggregators—creates significant barriers to implementing coordinated maintenance strategies. Traditional centralized maintenance approaches, which rely on direct asset control and uniform communication protocols, are ill-suited for environments where assets are owned and operated by multiple independent entities with varying technical capabilities and business objectives.

The challenge of coordinating predictive maintenance in decentralized DER ecosystems is fundamentally a communication and coordination problem. Effective predictive maintenance requires the continuous collection and analysis of real-time health data from distributed assets, the secure sharing of this information among relevant stakeholders, and the coordinated scheduling of maintenance activities to minimize grid disruption while maximizing asset availability (Zhang et al., 2019). Current approaches typically rely on proprietary communication systems and bilateral agreements between asset owners and maintenance providers, resulting in fragmented, inefficient, and often reactive maintenance practices that fail to leverage the collective intelligence available across the DER ecosystem.

Emerging agent-based communication protocols offer a promising paradigm for addressing these coordination challenges. Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) and Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A) represent a new generation of decentralized communication frameworks specifically designed for multi-agent systems operating in complex, dynamic environments (Smith et al., 2023). These protocols enable autonomous software agents representing different DER assets and stakeholders to communicate, negotiate, and coordinate activities without requiring centralized control or pre-established communication hierarchies. By providing standardized yet flexible communication primitives, semantic interoperability mechanisms, and built-in security features, these protocols could potentially transform how predictive maintenance is coordinated across diverse DER fleets.

Despite their potential, the application of agent communication protocols to DER predictive maintenance remains largely unexplored. Existing research has primarily focused on agent-based approaches for energy trading and grid balancing (Ringler et al., 2016; Khorasany et al., 2020), with limited attention to maintenance coordination. Furthermore, critical questions remain regarding how these general-purpose protocols can be adapted to meet the specific requirements of DER maintenance communication, including compliance with energy sector standards (e.g., IEEE 1547-2018), integration with existing grid management systems, and accommodation of the diverse technical capabilities of DER stakeholders.

This research addresses this gap by investigating how emerging agent communication protocols—specifically ACP and A2A—can be applied and adapted to enable secure, scalable, and interoperable communication for decentralized predictive maintenance coordination among diverse DERs owned and operated by different entities. By developing a conceptual framework for agent-based maintenance communication and establishing a quantitative evaluation methodology, this work aims to provide both theoretical insights and practical guidance for implementing next-generation DER maintenance systems that can operate effectively in increasingly decentralized energy landscapes.
