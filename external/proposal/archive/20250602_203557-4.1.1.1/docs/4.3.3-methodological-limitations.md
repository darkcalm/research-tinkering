*Generated: 2025-06-02 06:26:40*

This document aggregates and categorizes methodological limitations identified in previous research tasks.

## Summary Table

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Practical Validation | 0 |
| System Evaluation | 0 |
| Heuristic/Indirect Evidence | 2 |
| Scope/Corpus | 2 |
| Integration/Extensions | 2 |
| Other | 2 |

## Detailed Limitations by Category

### Practical Validation
- None

### System Evaluation
- None

### Heuristic/Indirect Evidence
- **Heuristic Mapping:** Keyword-based matching may miss nuanced relationships
- **Indirect Evidence:** Much support is inferred rather than explicit

### Scope/Corpus
- **Scope Constraints:** Limited to current literature corpus (64 papers)
- **Validation Scope:** Limited to current literature corpus and search methodology

### Integration/Extensions
- **System Integration:** Need stronger theoretical basis for complex interdependencies
- **Future Extensions:** Require clearer pathways for framework evolution

### Other
- **Temporal Factors:** Validation reflects current state of literature
- **Implementation Details:** May need more granular concept definitions
