# Research Objectives, Questions, and Scope Summary (Tasks 4.5.2-4.5.3)

*Generated: 2025-01-01*

## Summary

The research objectives, questions, and scope/limitations sections for FA1 have been successfully drafted.

## Key Components Included

### Research Objectives and Questions
1. **Overall Aim**: Investigation and conceptual design of ACP/A2A for DER predictive maintenance
2. **Specific Objectives**: Five measurable objectives covering analysis, investigation, design, specification, and evaluation
3. **Primary Research Question**: Focus on application and adaptation of ACP/A2A for secure, scalable, and interoperable communication
4. **Sub-Questions**: Three targeted questions addressing requirements, protocol application, and evaluation metrics

### Scope and Limitations
1. **Scope Parameters**:
   - Protocol focus on ACP and A2A
   - Use case specificity to predictive maintenance
   - Quantitative framework development approach
   - Analysis based on literature and limited validation

2. **Key Limitations**:
   - Time and resource constraints (20-week thesis)
   - Limited empirical validation
   - Protocol scope restrictions
   - DER type generalization
   - Conceptual-level security analysis
   - Data accessibility challenges

3. **Mitigation Strategies**:
   - Focus on high-impact aspects
   - Leverage existing literature
   - Clear documentation of assumptions
   - Recommendations for future work

## Word Count Considerations

The objectives and scope sections add approximately 600 words to the proposal, bringing the total to approximately 2,200 words, which is within the acceptable range (can extend to 3,000 words if necessary).

## Integration with FA1

These sections complement the background section and provide:
- Clear research direction and objectives
- Well-defined scope boundaries
- Transparent acknowledgment of limitations
- Foundation for methodology discussion (FA2)
