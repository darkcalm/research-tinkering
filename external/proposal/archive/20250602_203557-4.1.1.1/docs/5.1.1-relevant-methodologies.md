- **Timeline**: Moderate - 10-16 weeks depending on case complexity
- **Suitability**: Moderate - Good for understanding protocol application contexts
- **Alignment**: Moderate - Provides real-world validation but limited to specific contexts

#### Grounded Theory Methodology
- **Type**: Theory-building approach
- **Description**: Methodology for building theory from systematic data collection and analysis
- **Timeline**: Poor - Requires extensive data collection (16-24 weeks)
- **Suitability**: Low - Better suited for social phenomena than technical protocols
- **Alignment**: Low - Not well-suited for technical protocol research

#### Phenomenological Research Methodology
- **Type**: Experience-focused approach
- **Description**: Methodology for understanding lived experiences and meanings
- **Timeline**: Poor - Extensive qualitative analysis required
- **Suitability**: Very Low - Not appropriate for technical protocol research
- **Alignment**: Very Low - Does not match technical research objectives

### Mixed Methodologies
Methodologies combining quantitative and qualitative approaches for triangulation

#### Sequential Explanatory Mixed Methods
- **Type**: Sequential integration approach
- **Description**: Methodology using quantitative phase followed by qualitative phase for explanation
- **Timeline**: Moderate - 14-18 weeks for full sequence
- **Suitability**: High - Quantitative evaluation followed by contextual understanding
- **Alignment**: High - Comprehensive approach for protocol research

#### Sequential Exploratory Mixed Methods
- **Type**: Sequential exploration approach
- **Description**: Methodology using qualitative exploration followed by quantitative validation
