# Search Strategy for Non-Academic Industry Channels (Angle 6)

**Associated Task:** `4.1.8.4.2 Develop search strategy for non-academic industry channels`

**Building upon:**
*   Overall Industry Search Strategy: `docs/4.1.8.1-industry-search-strategy-angle6.md`
*   Identified Industry Channels: `docs/4.1.8.2-industry-search-channels-angle6.md`
*   Developed Industry Search Terms: `docs/4.1.8.3-industry-search-terms-angle6.md`

## 1. Objective
To define a systematic approach for searching non-academic industry channels to gather qualitative data, identify trends, discover commercial solutions, and understand real-world perspectives related to human factors, communication gaps, and AI agent protocol opportunities in DER operations (Angle 6). This complements the academic search conducted via the CORE API.

## 2. Guiding Principles
*   **Iterative & Adaptive:** The search process will be iterative. Initial findings will inform subsequent searches and refinement of search terms or target channels.
*   **Focus on "Grey Literature":** Prioritize content not typically found in peer-reviewed journals, such as white papers, case studies, technical blogs, product documentation, webinar recordings, and forum discussions.
*   **Human Operator Centricity:** All searches should maintain a focus on the human element within the DER lifecycle (installation, maintenance, operations), as detailed in the Angle 6 scope.
*   **Practical Application Focus:** Seek information that highlights real-world challenges, existing solutions (commercial or in-house), best practices, and unmet needs rather than purely theoretical discussions.
*   **Systematic Skimming & Prioritization:** Due to the potentially vast amount of information, develop efficient skimming techniques and prioritize resources that directly address the key questions outlined in `docs/4.1.8.1-industry-search-strategy-angle6.md`.

## 3. Channel-Specific Search Strategies

The following strategies will be applied to the channels identified in `docs/4.1.8.2-industry-search-channels-angle6.md`, using the search terms from `docs/4.1.8.3-industry-search-terms-angle6.md`.

### 3.3. Professional Networking Sites (e.g., LinkedIn)
*   **Targets:** Profiles of relevant professionals, company pages, group discussions, articles published on the platform.
*   **Method:**
    *   **People Search:** Use keywords for roles (e.g., "DER Operations Manager," "SCADA Engineer," "Field Service Technician Energy," "Grid Modernization Specialist") combined with skills or company names. Analyze profiles for experience related to Angle 6.
    *   **Company Search:** Follow key DER operators, utilities, and technology providers. Review their posts and articles.
    *   **Group Search & Participation:** Join relevant groups (e.g., "DER Management," "Smart Grid Operations," "Utility Professionals," "Energy Sector Safety"). Search within groups for keywords related to human factors, communication, AI in operations. Observe discussions and identify key themes or pain points.
    *   **Content Search:** Use LinkedIn's main search bar for articles and posts, filtering by "Content." Use queries like `"human factors in DER" "linkedin articles"` or specific search strings from `docs/4.1.8.3-industry-search-terms-angle6.md`.
*   **Prioritization:** Articles or posts by experienced professionals discussing challenges or solutions. Group discussions revealing common pain points or unmet needs.

### 3.4. Conference Proceedings & Presentations (Industry-focused)
*   **Targets:** Slides, videos, papers from industry conferences (if accessible, some are paywalled or require membership).
*   **Method:**
    *   Identify key industry conferences (e.g., DISTRIBUTECH, IEEE PES T&D, Intersolar, local/regional utility conferences).
    *   Search conference websites for proceedings or presentation archives. Use keywords related to Angle 6, focusing on tracks related to operations, maintenance, safety, grid modernization, and human factors.

Be prepared to adapt and combine terms based on the specific search interface of each channel. Use Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) and phrase searching ("...") extensively.
*   **Initial Broad Searches, then Refinement:** Start with broader terms to understand the landscape within a channel, then narrow down with more specific lifecycle stage, role, or technology keywords.
*   **"Snowballing":** When a highly relevant resource or expert is found, check their references, citations, affiliated organizations, or other publications/presentations to find related information.
*   **Data Capture (Lightweight):**
    *   Maintain a shared document or spreadsheet to log promising resources.
    *   For each resource, capture:
        *   URL
        *   Title/Source
        *   Date accessed
        *   Channel type (e.g., Company Blog, Trade Publication Article, LinkedIn Post)
        *   Brief summary of relevance to Angle 6 (1-2 sentences)
        *   Key takeaways or direct quotes related to human operator tasks, challenges, communication, or AI opportunities.
    *   This is not a full report, but a collection of pointers and initial notes for later synthesis in task `4.1.8.5`.
