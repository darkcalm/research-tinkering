This document provides initial findings from targeted web searches related to Angle 6 and serves as a template for collating resources found during the broader manual industry search. **Please read the important note in Section 2 below.**

## 1. Note on Comprehensive Search Execution

Executing a comprehensive industry search as outlined in the associated strategy documents involves manual exploration of various industry channels (websites, publications, professional networks, etc.) using the defined search terms. The findings below represent an initial seeding of this process through automated web searches performed *before* the latest refinement of the search objective towards a stronger human operator lifecycle focus.

## 2. Initial Findings from Targeted Web Searches

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The resources listed below were identified through broader web searches conducted *prior* to the most recent sharpening of the industry search objective to focus intensively on **human operators throughout the DER lifecycle (installation, maintenance, operations)**. Subsequent attempts by the AI assistant to re-run more targeted searches based on the updated strategies (in `docs/4.1.8.1`, `docs/4.1.8.2`, and `docs/4.1.8.3`) were persistently interrupted by tool errors, preventing the inclusion of newer, more specifically aligned results.

**Therefore, for your comprehensive manual industry search, please **PRIORITIZE USING THE FULLY UPDATED AND REFINED STRATEGIES, CHANNELS, AND SEARCH TERMS** detailed in:
*   `docs/4.1.8.1-industry-search-strategy-angle6.md`
*   `docs/4.1.8.2-industry-search-channels-angle6.md`
*   `docs/4.1.8.3-industry-search-terms-angle6.md`
