# Archive: 4.1.8.4 Industry Search (Incorrect Approach)

**Archived on:** 2025-06-03 12:00:52  
**Task:** 4.1.8.4 Execute search and gather potential industry resources  
**Reason for archiving:** Misunderstanding of scope - incorrectly interpreted "industry search" as non-academic search

## What was archived

This folder contains files related to an incorrect interpretation of task 4.1.8.4, where "industry search" was mistakenly understood to mean searching non-academic industry channels rather than academic research focused on industry applications.

### Files archived:

#### Strategy and Documentation (from docs/)
- `4.1.8.4-initial-industry-search-findings-angle6.md` - Initial findings summary
- `4.1.8.4.2-non-academic-industry-search-strategy.md` - Non-academic search strategy (incorrect approach)
- `4.1.8.4-industry-core-search-summary-session-1.md` - Summary of CORE API search

#### Scripts and Logs (from tools/)
- `4.1.8.4_industry_dynamic_search.py` - Adapted CORE API search script for industry focus
- `4.1.8.4_industry_dynamic_search.log` - Execution log

#### Search Results (from sources/)
- `4.1.8-industry-search-results/` - Directory containing search results from the CORE API industry search
  - `session-1/` - Results from the first (and only) search session using the adapted CORE API script

## Correction

The correct interpretation of "industry search" should focus on:
- Academic research with industry applications
- Papers published by industry researchers
- Industry-funded academic studies
- Applied research relevant to industry contexts

The search should remain within academic databases (like CORE API) but with focus on industry-relevant content, not external non-academic industry channels.

## Status

- Task 4.1.8.4.1 (CORE API industry search) was completed correctly
- Task 4.1.8.4.2 (non-academic industry search) was removed from task list as incorrect scope
- Task 4.1.8.4 can be marked as complete with the CORE API search results
