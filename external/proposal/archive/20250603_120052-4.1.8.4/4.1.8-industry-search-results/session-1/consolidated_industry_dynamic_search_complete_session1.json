        "title": "When a bus met a museum: following artists, curators and workers in art installation",
        "abstract": "In this essay, I intend to offer an alternative to viewing the museum and the exhibition through the visitor\u2019s expectations. Instead, I shall follow all those actors whom the viewer usually does not meet in the museum: the artists, the curators, the technicians and the workers. The visitor knows they exist and that they have worked hard to stage all these art installations for the public, but he or she has never seen them working, discussing and acting together in the artistic process. This essay is an invitation to the viewer to follow these actors and to perform a slow and unusual visit to the exhibition H\u00e4user, held in Mus\u00e9e d\u2019art Moderne de la Ville de Paris in 1999. In this context, art objects will be seen in the process of their doing. A specific case will be discussed: the installation of a Volkswagen bus, model 1977, in the museum, and its transformation into a contemporary art installation named M\u00fcckenbus. This example is particularly interesting, because the bus passes though the museum entrance door, back and forth, as does a visitor, and because a whole group of actors is assembled and mobilized to help insert the bus and to adjust its position in the exhibition hall. I will describe how artists, curators, technicians and workers adapt space, tools and materials to the artistic idea; what happens to the bus when it meets the museum, and consider some of the ways in which such installation operations transform the museum world in the process. Before analyzing the bus\u2019s tribulations, however, I will trace briefly some key research tendencies on museums that help us to consider this particular case",

        "title": "Research on rising competences in technical education by implementing dual system\u00b4s elements under El Salvador conditions in the field of Mechatronic",
        "abstract": "Die Besch\u00e4ftigungsf\u00e4higkeit ist einer der gr\u00f6\u00dften Anliegen in El Salvador, besonders f\u00fcr Jugendlichen (UNPD, 2008). Au\u00dferdem betont die Studie \u00fcber die Herausforderungen des Bildungssystems in El Salvador die Notwendigkeit, eine Ankn\u00fcpfung zwischen Akademie und Industrie zu haben (Barraza, 2008). In diesem Kontext begann El Salvador in 2008 die Umsetzung von einigen Elementen des Deutschen Dualsystems (neues System) im Bereich der technologischen Ausbildung, mit der Absicht, einen Versuch zu machen ob dieses System bessere Kompetenzen bei Studenten entwickelt, welche ihnen bessere Arbeitseinsatzm\u00f6glichkeiten anbietet. Im Dualsystem wird die  Ausbildung von der Akademie und Industriesektor geleistet.\n\nGrunds\u00e4tzliche Ziele waren: (1) Analyse der Einfl\u00fcsse zur Ansteigung der Besch\u00e4ftigungsf\u00e4higkeit unter Gebrauch einer besseren Kombination von Theorie und Praxis w\u00e4hrend des Studiums \u2013 M\u00f6glichkeiten einer Dualerfahrung aus Deutschland unter den Bedingungen in El Salvador (2) Analyse der M\u00f6glichkeiten und Probleme unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung des Kompetenzschwerpunktes f\u00fcr die Entwicklung und Besch\u00e4ftigungsf\u00e4higkeit der Studenten; (3) Festlegung, ob die Studenten mit Studienausgang in 2008-2010, die im Dualsystem teilgenommen haben, bessere berufliche Kompetenzen zur Einsetzung im Produktivprozess erlangt haben  im Vergleich zu diejenigen aus dem traditionalem System (ohne Unternehmenserfahrung); (4) Festlegung der Einflussfaktoren die den Industriesektor an der Teilnahme am Dualsystem motivieren; und (5) Darstellung der Folgen aus der Umsetzung dieses Systems unter den salvadorianischen Gegebenheiten und Anregungen zu deren Anpassung zu entwickeln. \n\nBei der Untersuchung ging es um die Erstellung eines Vergleichs zwischen Studenten der Studienrichtung Mechatronik mit Ausgang in 2008 \u2013 2010; ein Student aus dem Dualsystem und einer aus dem traditionellen System. Die angewandte wissenschaftliche Methodologie war eine Verkn\u00fcpfung von einer quantitativen und qualitativen Methode mit Fragebogen, Interviews und Messungen der Kompetenzen, n\u00f6tige Zeit zum Erwerben einer Arbeitsstelle und Gehaltsbedingungen.\n\nDie Ergebnisse der Untersuchung waren: (a) Beide Gruppen hatten \u00e4hnliche Kompetenzen laut ihrer akademischen Benotung, aber bessere Kompetenzen f\u00fcr die Duale Gruppe wenn Arbeitsbedingungen eingeschlossen sind.  In Bezug auf die Motivation der Entscheidungstr\u00e4gern hat die Untersuchung folgendes erwiesen: (1) Vorherige Kenntnis \u00fcber das System (2) Personen sind mit bessere Kompetenzen bedarfsgerecht f\u00fcr die Industrie ausgebildet; (3) Minderung des Risikos, falsche Leute aufzunehmen; (4) Optimierung der Ausbildungskosten, (5) Innovation einer neuen Studienrichtung die vom Unternehmen ben\u00f6tigt wird; (6) Soziale Verantwortung; und (7) Verbesserung der Produktivit\u00e4t und Qualit\u00e4t. Schlussfolgerung ist, das Dualsystem k\u00f6nnte eine M\u00f6glichkeit f\u00fcr die Verbesserung der Kompetenzniveaus als auch f\u00fcr die Besch\u00e4ftigungsf\u00e4higkeit der Studenten in El Salvador sein, jedoch bringt es neue Herausforderungen f\u00fcr das technologische Ausbildungssystem.Employability is one of the biggest concerns in El Salvador, especially for young people (UNPD, 2008). Besides, the study about challenges in the educative system in El Salvador, outlines the necessity to have a link between academy and industry (Barraza, 2008). Under this context 2008, El Salvador began the implementation of some elements of the German Dual System (New system) in technological education, with the purpose to experiment if this system developed better competences in students allowing them better job opportunities. In  Dual System,  the formation is developed between the academy and the enterprise.\n\nThe main purposes were: (1) To analyze influences to rise employability under using of better combination of theory and practice in studies - possibilities of dual experiences from Germany for El Salvador`s conditions; (2) to analyze possibilities and problems using competences approach for student\u2019s development and employability; (3) to determine if the students of cohort 2008-2010 who study under dual system acquire better professional competences to be inserted in the productive process that those from traditional system (without enterprise curriculum); (4) to determine the factors that motivates industrialists to participate in dual system; and (5) to show consequences of implement this system under the Salvadoran reality and develop suggestions its adaptation. \n\nThe research was comparing students from cohort 2008 \u2013 2010 in Mechatronic career; one in dual and other in traditional system. The scientific methodology to apply were a combination of quantitative and qualitative method with questionnaires, interviews and measurements about competences, time to get a job and the salary conditions.\n\nResults of the research are: (a) both groups had similar competences according academics grades, but better competences for Dual group when jobs conditions are included. About decision makers motivations, findings were: (1) Previous knowledge about the system; (2) People with better competences according the needs of the company; (3) to reduce the risk to hire wrong people; (4) Optimize training costs, (5) the innovation of a new career that enterprise needs; (6) social responsibility; and (7) to improve the productivity and quality. In conclusion, Dual system could be an opportunity in El Salvador for improving the level of competences, and the employability of the students, but it means new challenges in technological educational system",

        "abstract": "T\u00e4ss\u00e4 tutkielmassa analysoin teknisen viestinn\u00e4n multimodaalisuutta kokeellisen suunnittelun avulla. Kokeessani suunnittelen ja konvertoin \u00e4lylasien pienelle n\u00e4yt\u00f6lle kolme lyhytt\u00e4 KONE Oyj:n asennus- ja huolto-ohjetta. Vaikka k\u00e4yt\u00e4n kokeessani \u00e4lylaseja, tutkimuksen n\u00e4ytt\u00f6 voisi periaatteessa olla mik\u00e4 tahansa pieni n\u00e4ytt\u00f6, esimerkiksi \u00e4lypuhelin tai \u00e4lykello, jonka ajantasainen sis\u00e4lt\u00f6 on teoriassa helpommin kuljetettavissa mukana kuin paperille tulostettu perinteinen PDF-ohje. Konvertoin ohjeet k\u00e4ytt\u00e4en kahta teoriaa: visuaaliset ohjeet (Gattullo et al. 2019) ja minimalismiheuristiikka (van der Meij ja Carroll, 1998).

T\u00e4ten konversio- ja suunnitteluteorioiden vastapainoksi multimodaalisuuden teoriat (esimerkiksi, Bateman, Wildfeuer ja Hiippala, 2017) auttavat analysoimaan konversioiden ymm\u00e4rrett\u00e4vyyden eroja systemaattisesti.

Koska toinen tutkimani teoria, visuaaliset ohjeet, perustuvat verbien korvaamiseen symboleilla, symbolien ymm\u00e4rrett\u00e4vyys korostuu merkitt\u00e4v\u00e4n\u00e4 erona visuaalisten ohjeiden k\u00e4ytett\u00e4vyydess\u00e4.

Um geeignete Personalentwicklungsma\u00dfnahmen und Qualifizierungsprozesse gestalten zu k\u00f6nnen, ist es notwendig, die Arbeitswelt im Sektor inhaltlich zu erschlie\u00dfen. Dazu wurde im ersten Schritt der Fachkr\u00e4ftemangel auf der shop-floor Ebene innerhalb des produzierenden Sektors mittels des berufswissenschaftlichen Instrumentes der Sektoranalyse analysiert.

In particular with regard to the need of occupational group of engineers and technicians the reports are exceedingly alarming. However, what is the need for the level of skilled work in the production sector (metal and electrical industry) in Germany? Do these sectors already look explicitly for skilled personnel? The project 'Shortage of Skilled Workers' deals with these deficits and aims at developing concepts for the avoidance of a shortage of skilled workers in cooperation with the enterprise. In order to design adequate personnel development measures and qualification processes it is necessary to access the world of work in the sector in terms of contents. In a first step the shortage of skilled workers on the shop-floor level within the production sector was therefore analysed with the occupational scientific instrument of the sector analysis. In the present report the results of the sector analysis will be described for Germany.\" (author's abstract",

One suitable approach to integrating distributed intelligent systems is multi-agent systems technology, where components of functionality run as autonomous agents capable of interaction through messaging. This provides loose coupling between components that can benefit the complex systems envisioned for the smart grid. This paper reviews the key milestones of demonstrated agent systems in the power industry and considers which aspects of agent design must still be addressed for widespread application of agent technology to occur",

        "title": "A Reserve-Based Method for Mitigating the Impact of Renewable Energy",
        "abstract": "The fundamental operating paradigm of today\\u27s power systems is undergoing a significant shift. This is partially motivated by the increased desire for incorporating variable renewable energy resources into generation portfolios. While these generating technologies offer clean energy at zero marginal cost, i.e. no fuel costs, they also offer unique operating challenges for system operators. Perhaps the biggest operating challenge these resources introduce is accommodating their intermittent fuel source availability. For this reason, these generators increase the system-wide variability and uncertainty. As a result, system operators are revisiting traditional operating strategies to more efficiently incorporate these generation resources to maximize the benefit they provide while minimizing the challenges they introduce.\nOne way system operators have accounted for system variability and uncertainty is through the use of operating reserves. Operating reserves can be simplified as excess capacity kept online during real time operations to help accommodate unforeseen fluctuations in demand. With new generation resources, a new class of operating reserves has emerged that is generally known as flexibility, or ramping, reserves. This new reserve class is meant to better position systems to mitigate severe ramping in the net load profile. The best way to define this new requirement is still under investigation. Typical requirement definitions focus on the additional uncertainty introduced by variable generation and there is room for improvement regarding explicit consideration for the variability they introduce. An exogenous reserve modification method is introduced in this report that can improve system reliability with minimal impacts on total system wide production costs.\nAnother potential solution to this problem is to formulate the problem as a stochastic programming problem. The unit commitment and economic dispatch problems are typically formulated as deterministic problems due to fast solution times and the solutions being sufficient for operations. Improvements in technical computing hardware have reignited interest in stochastic modeling. The variability of wind and solar naturally lends itself to stochastic modeling. The use of explicit reserve requirements in stochastic models is an area of interest for power system researchers. This report introduces a new reserve modification implementation based on previous results to be used in a stochastic modeling framework.\nWith technological improvements in distributed generation technologies, microgrids are currently being researched and implemented. Microgrids are small power systems that have the ability to serve their demand with their own generation resources and may have a connection to a larger power system. As battery technologies improve, they are becoming a more viable option in these distributed power systems and research is necessary to determine the most efficient way to utilize them. This report will investigate several unique operating strategies for batteries in small power systems and analyze their benefits. These new operating strategies will help reduce operating costs and improve system reliability",

        "abstract": "Emerging applications in Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems\n(CPS) present novel challenges to Big Data platforms for performing online\nanalytics. Ubiquitous sensors from IoT deployments are able to generate data\nstreams at high velocity, that include information from a variety of domains,\nand accumulate to large volumes on disk. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is\nrecognized as an important real-time computing paradigm for analyzing\ncontinuous data streams. However, existing work on CEP is largely limited to\nrelational query processing, exposing two distinctive gaps for query\nspecification and execution: (1) infusing the relational query model with\nhigher level knowledge semantics, and (2) seamless query evaluation across\ntemporal spaces that span past, present and future events. These allow\naccessible analytics over data streams having properties from different\ndisciplines, and help span the velocity (real-time) and volume (persistent)\ndimensions. In this article, we introduce a Knowledge-infused CEP (X-CEP)\nframework that provides domain-aware knowledge query constructs along with\ntemporal operators that allow end-to-end queries to span across real-time and\npersistent streams. We translate this query model to efficient query execution\nover online and offline data streams, proposing several optimizations to\nmitigate the overheads introduced by evaluating semantic predicates and in\naccessing high-volume historic data streams. The proposed X-CEP query model and\nexecution approaches are implemented in our prototype semantic CEP engine,\nSCEPter. We validate our query model using domain-aware CEP queries from a\nreal-world Smart Power Grid application, and experimentally analyze the\nbenefits of our optimizations for executing these queries, using event streams\nfrom a campus-microgrid IoT deployment.Comment: 34 pages, 16 figures, accepted in Future Generation Computer Systems,\n  October 27, 201",

        "title": "Occupant-Centric Modeling and Control for Low-Carbon and Resilient Communities",
        "abstract": "Global climate change and resulting frequent extreme weather events have highlighted the significance of energy sustainability and resilience. Communities, which refer to a group of buildings located geographically together, are important units for energy generation and consumption. Hence, the research of community energy sustainability and resilience has drawn much attention during the past decades. However, there remain many challenges surrounding community energy modeling and control to achieve the low-carbon and resilient goals.\nFirst, few tools are readily available for community-scale dynamic modeling and control-based studies. To address this gap, a community emulator was developed, which was designed to be hierarchical, scalable, and suitable for various applications. Data-driven stochastic building occupancy prediction was integrated into the emulator using logistic regression methods. Based on this work, we publicly released a library for net-zero energy community modeling using the object-oriented equation-based modeling language Modelica.\nSecond, building load control informed by real-time carbon emission signals is underdeveloped as utility price-driven control has so far been dominant. To better facilitate community energy sustainability through decarbonization, we proposed four rule-based carbon emission responsive building control algorithms to reduce the annual carbon emissions through thermostatically controllable loads. The impact of carbon net-metering, as well as the evolvement of the future energy generation mix, is analyzed on top of both momentary and predictive rules. Based on the simulation results, the average annual household carbon emissions are decreased by 6.0% to 20.5% compared to the baseline. The average annual energy consumption is increased by less than 6.7% due to more clean hours over the year. The annual energy cost change lies between -4.1% and 3.4% on top of the baseline.\nThird, the enhancement of community resilience in an islanded mode through optimal operation strategies is often faced with computational challenges given the large number of controllable loads. To tackle this, we proposed a two-layer model predictive control-based resource allocation and load scheduling framework for community resilience enhancement. Within this framework, the community operator layer optimally allocates the available PV generation to each building, while the building agent layer optimally schedules controllable loads to minimize the unserved load ratio while maintaining thermal comfort. We found that the allocation process is mostly constrained by the building load flexibility. More specifically, buildings with less load flexibility tend to be allocated more PV generation than other buildings. Further, we identified the competitive relationship between the objectives of minimizing unserved load ratio and maximize comfort. Therefore, it is necessary for the building agent to have multi-objective optimization.\nFinally, to account for the uncertainties of occupant behavior and its impact on resilient community load scheduling, we developed a preference-aware scheduler for resilient communities. Stochastic occupant thermostat-changing behavior models were introduced into the deterministic load scheduling framework as a source of uncertainty. KRIs such as the unserved load ratio, the required battery size, and the unmet thermal preference hours were adopted to quantify the impacts. Uncertainties from occupants&rsquo; thermal preferences and their impact on load scheduling are then studied and addressed through chance constraints. Generally, the proposed controller performs better in terms of the unmet thermal preference hours and the battery sizes compared to the deterministic controller.</p",

        "abstract": "The motivation of this work is to present an energy cost reduction concept in a home area power network (HAPN) with intelligent generation and flexible load demands. This study endeavors to address the energy management system (EMS) and layout-design challenges faced by HAPN through a systematic design approach. The growing demand for electricity has become a significant burden on traditional power networks, prompting power engineers to seek ways to improve their efficiency. One such solution is to integrate dispersed generation sources, such as photovoltaic (PV) and storage systems, with an appropriate control mechanism at the distribution level. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in interest in the installation of PV-Battery systems, due to their potential to reduce carbon emissions and lower energy costs. This research proposes an optimal economic power dispatch strategy using Model Predictive Control (MPC) to enhance the overall performance of HAPN. A hybrid AC/DC microgrid concept is proposed to address the control choices made by the appliance scheduling and hybrid switching approaches based on a linear programming optimization framework. The suggested optimization criteria improve consumer satisfaction, minimize grid disconnections, and lower overall energy costs by deploying inexpensive clean energy generation and control. Various examples from actual case study demonstrate the use of the established EMS and design methodology.Die Motivation dieser Arbeit besteht darin, ein Konzept zur Senkung der Energiekosten in einem Heimnetzwerk (HAPN) mit intelligenter Erzeugung und  exiblen Lastanforderungen vorzustellen. Im Rahmen dieser Forschungsarbeit wird ein Entwurf f\u00fcr ein HAPN entwickelt, indem das Energiemanagementsystem (EMS) und der Entwurf des Layouts auf der Grundlage des Systemmodells und der betrieblichen Anforderungen gel\u00f6st werden. Die steigende Nachfrage nach Elektrizit\u00e4t ist f\u00fcr traditionelle Stromnetze kostspielig und infrastrukturintensiv. Daher konzentrieren sich Energietechniker darauf, die Effizienz der derzeitigen Netze zu erh\u00f6hen. Dies kann durch die Integration verteilter Erzeugungsanlagen (z. B. Photovoltaik (PV), Speicher) mit einem geeigneten Kontrollmechanismus f\u00fcr das Energiemanagement auf der Verteilungsseite erreicht werden. Dar\u00fcber hinaus hat das Interesse an der Installation von PV-Batterie-basierten Systemen aufgrund der Reduzierung der CO2-Emissionen und der Senkung der Energiekosten erheblich zugenommen. Es wird eine optimale wirtschaftliche Strategie f\u00fcr den Energieeinsatz unter Verwendung einer modellpr\u00e4diktiven Steuerung (MPC) entwickelt. Es wird zudem ein hybrides AC/DC-Microgrid-Konzept vorgeschlagen, um die Steuerungsentscheidungen, die von den Ans\u00e4tzen der Ger\u00e4teplanung und der hybriden Umschaltung getroffen werden, auf der Grundlage eines linearen Programmierungsoptimierungsrahmens zu ber\u00fccksichtigen. Die vorgeschlagenen Optimierungskriterien verbessern die Zufriedenheit der Verbraucher, minimieren Netzabschaltungen und senken die Gesamtenergiekosten durch den Einsatz von kosteng\u00fcnstiger und sauberer Energieerzeugung. Verschiedene Beispiele aus einer Fallstudie demonstrieren den Einsatz des entwickelten EMS und der Entwurfsmethodik",

        "abstract": "In this work, a synchronverter-based control strategy is proposed to operate the STATCOM as a synchronous compensator. Moreover, to cope with unbalanced conditions that may appear at the grid, a novel voltage imbalance compensation control is developed to work harmoniously with the main synchronverter model. The used base synchronous generator model is derived from a general AC machine in space vector representation. Practical details about the controller design are addressed as well as a small-signal model for stability analysis and parameter tuning. Two scenarios are simulated: large-scale and small-scale system, the latter being used as a validation step for implementation in a small experimental setup. Both simulations and experimental results confirm the suitable performance of the proposed control.Neste trabalho, um controle baseado em synchronverter \u00e9 proposto para operar um STATCOM como compensador s\u00edncrono.

        "abstract": "Master's thesis in Offshore TechnologyThis report describes the computations that have been made to simulate the O&M cost for a generic floating\r\noffshore wind farm. The aim of this paper is to investigate if the floating foundation technology offers new\r\napproaches for the way offshore wind power plants are operated and maintained. The possibility to return the semisubmersible\r\nwind turbine to shore, allows that maintenance activities could be carried out near to shore (for\r\nexample in a dry dock) with fewer restrictions and lower cost. The point of interest therefore is, to what extent it\r\nis technical and economical feasible to perform \u201coffshore\u201d maintenance in comparison with \u201conshore\u201d\r\nmaintenance for which the floating platform needs to be repositioned. This was studied by comparing the cost for\r\neach O&M strategy. Weather restrictions, distance to shore and the technology readiness level influence both\r\nconcepts. In general, it can be concluded that with the current technology level, returning a semi-submersible\r\nfloating wind turbine for scheduled maintenance campaigns on a regular basis is not an economical and technical\r\nfeasible approach. Keeping in mind, that the floating wind turbine technology is still in the prototype and precommercial\r\nphase, this also concludes that there is still large potential for improvement",

        "title": "Maintenance optimisation for wind turbines.",
        "abstract": "Wind is becoming an increasingly important source of energy for countries that ratify to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and mitigate the effects of global warming. Investments in wind farms are affected by inter-related assets and stakeholders requirements. These requirements demand a well-founded Asset Management (AM) frame-work which is currently lacking in the wind industry. Drawing from processes, tools and techniques of AM in other industries, a structured model for AM in the wind industry is developed. The model divulges that maintenance is indispensable to the core business objectives of the wind industry. However, the common maintenance strategies applied to wind turbines are inadequate to support the current commercial drivers of the wind industry. Consequently, a hybrid approach to the selection of a suitable maintenance strategy is developed. The approach is used in a case study to demonstrate its practical application. Suitable Condition-Based Maintenance activities for wind turbines are determined. Maintenance optimisation is a means to determine the most cost-effective maintenance strategy. Field failure and maintenance data of wind turbines are collected and analysed using two quantitative maintenance optimisation techniques; Modelling System Failures (MSF) and Delay-Time Maintenance Model (DTMM). The MSF permits the evaluation of life-data samples and enables the design and simulation of a systems model to determine optimum maintenance activities. Maximum Likelihood Estimation is used to estimate the shape (\u00ce\u00b2) and scale (\u00ce\u00b7) parameters of the Weibull distribution for critical components and subsystems of the wind turbines. Reliability Block Diagrams are designed using the estimated \u00ce\u00b2 and \u00ce\u00b7 to model the failures of the wind turbines and of a selected wind farm. The models are simulated to assess and optimise the reliability, availability and maintainability of the wind turbine and the farm. The DTMM examines equipment failure patterns by taking into account failure consequences, inspection time and cost in order to determine optimum inspection intervals. Defects rate (\u00ce\u00b1) and mean delay-time (1/\u00ce\u00b3) of components and subsystems within the wind turbine are estimated. Optimal inspection intervals for critical subsystems of the wind turbine are then determined",

This paper presents an overview of the maritime logistics planning problem for a predictive maintenance regime and introduces the current state-of-the-art for operational research in the field of operation and maintenance at offshore wind farms. Findings are that a combination of the vessel resource scheduling problem for operation and maintenance at offshore wind farms with predictive analysis and digital twins is a promising future research step. A framework for a decision support tool is presented that will help bridge the gap, both with respect to the academic path, and the gap between academic research and industry.publishedVersio",

        "title": "Modelling analysis of maintenance logistics optimization for a floating wind park: A case study for Utsira Nord",
        "abstract": "The global society is part of a climate challenge that requires the development of will, understanding and technology. The United Nations has given the climate challenge its sustainability goal, saying, \"Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\" [1]. There will not be sufficiently developed energy production today in the context of future electrification of the Norwegian everyday life and industry. Norway needs to invest in more green energy production not to become an import nation of energy, but; an export nation. On June 12th, 2020, the Utsira Nord area was opened by the Government by royal decree for energy production from floating offshore wind [2]. \n\nBy taking a closer look at the well-known concept of Operating expenditures, one can see clear advantages and challenges related to floating offshore wind [3]. It shows how important it is to optimise the maintenance strategy for the industry, and this is the basis for this thesis. There are many logistics solutions, and many factors influencing the choice that is hard to know beforehand. Therefore, it will depend on each wind farm to decide the best alternative to provide maintenance services. Hence, this thesis aims to investigate the following questions:\n\u2022\tHow to utilize modelling and simulation method for selection of optimal maintenance logistics strategy for a wind farm at Utsira Nord\n\u2022\tWhat will be an optimal maintenance logistics strategy for an imaginary Utsira Nord wind farm, seen from cost-benefit perspective and emission perspective\n\nA case study has been carried out based on an imaginary wind farm at Utsira Nord to answer the research questions. Shoreline software is used to create simulations, and analyses potential technical solutions. The research is executed in the following steps: (1) extract stakeholder requirements and acceptance criteria and define the purpose of the simulation model, (2) systems analysis of the wind park, maintenance program and logistic vessels, (3) collect and extract failure and maintenance data from existing offshore wind parks, (4) collect technical and economic data for several logistic maintenance vessels, (5) design and prepare the simulation cases, (6) perform the simulation cases and visualise the results, (7) verification and validation, including sensitivity analysis and (8) evaluate and select the most optimal logistic vessel alternative based on cost/availability and emissions\n\n\nWhen it comes to the most optimal vessel for the case wind park, the result clearly shows that the service operation vessel provides more benefits in terms of overall grading for cost/availability and emissions. It comes out far better than the crew transfer vessel because of the sensitivity associated with the maximum wave height for this vessel. This causes a significantly higher downtime for the wind farm, and the analysis shows that the case can increase its turnover by \u20ac 13,844,000 by using a service operation vessel in favour of a crew transfer vessel concerning lost production.\n\nThe method used to carry out the analysis and simulation can be used as a starting point to provide the most optimal maintenance logistics strategy for each park. It can be common service operation vessel for several parks within the same field, several crew transfer vessels or make use of other logistical possibilities such as helicopters",

The research specifically addresses two primary questions:  \n\u2022How does the Jones Act impact the transport and installation of wind turbine generators in the U.S. offshore wind industry? \n\u2022What is the best overall solution to comply with Jones Act, for transport and installation of wind turbine generators in the U.S.?  \nThe U.S. has significant ambitions to expand its offshore wind capacity, with a federal target to deploy 30 gigawatts by 2030. The Jones Act, a century-old maritime law, presents both challenges and opportunities in this context. It requires that transportation between U.S. ports is performed by U.S. flagged vessels, which has significant impact on the transport and installation of wind turbine generators for offshore wind farm developments in the U.S. This study identifies two main methods for transport and installation of wind turbine generators: \n\u2022U.S. flagged Wind Turbine Installation Vessel  \n\u2022Foreign flagged Wind Turbine Installation Vessel with feeder barges \nThe thesis is based on a qualitative method using semi structured interviews with four key strategic stakeholders from the industry. This research is organized by using the Gioia method and supported by established guidelines about how to do qualitative research and case studies.\nThe thesis concludes that neither of the strategies are clearly better than the other across all aspects. The strategic decisions must consider specific project needs, stakeholder priorities, and the regulatory landscape. However, based on the favorable operational workability, this thesis outlines the U.S. flagged installation vessel as the best solution in the long-term perspective, despite the higher upfront capital investment. On the other hand, the foreign-flagged WTIVs with feeder barges present a lower upfront investment but may lead to increased operational complexities and challenges",

        "abstract": "Deciding when and how to maintain offshore wind turbines is becoming even more complex as the size of wind farms increases, while accessibility is challenging compared to onshore wind farms. Planning future maintenance actions requires the wind farm operator to consider factors such as the current condition of the turbine, the cost of a given maintenance action, revenue generated by the asset, weather factors and vessel availability. Rather than making case-by-case decisions for each turbine, the approach described in this paper allows the wind farm operators to automate the process of short to-medium term maintenance planning through application of a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP). The model proposed here is capable of suggesting the cost-optimal maintenance policy given weather forecast, future vessel costs and availability and the current condition of the turbine. Using the semi-Markov approach, allows the user to implement time varying failure rate. As the model is capable of utilising time-series data, future weather and vessel constraints can be applied depending on the information available to the user at the time, which will be reflected in the optimal policy suggested by the model. The model proposed here facilitates maintenance decision making in wind farms and will lead to cost reduction through more efficient planning. In addition to that, the model can be used to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of using vessels with different properties",

        "abstract": "The 2010 Milton Wolf Seminar brought together practitioners and academics for three days of exciting debate in Vienna, Austria from March 17 to 19 at the Diplomatic Academy Vienna. Co-sponsored by the American Austrian Foundation, the Center for Global Communication Studies at the University of Pennsylvania\u2018s Annenberg School for Communication, and the Diplomatic Academy Vienna, the seminar explored the theme, \u201cNew media, new newsmakers, new public diplomacy: The changing role of journalists, NGOs, and diplomats in a multi-modal media world.\u201d\nThe PremiseDiscussion began with a recognition that: as new media and communication technologies diffuse worldwide, traditional media institutions face a range of challenges, from shortened news cycles to fragmented and shrinking audiences. Advertising revenues have declined as advertisers try to make sense of the new environment and to redirect their spending in efficient and effective ways, putting media under economic pressure. New technologies create demand for ever-more rapid news provision and non-professional, user-generated content competes directly with the products of traditional news media. In response to these pressures, many news operations have engaged in aggressive downsizing, reducing their staff complements and eliminating foreign bureaus in a bid to contain costs and refocus their operations. These institutions are attempting to adapt to new technologies while retaining their traditional role of supplying accurate and factual news, sorting the important from the irrelevant \u2013 the traditional foundations of their businesses.\nPredictably, under these difficult conditions, the quality of news products suffers. Scott Maier, an associate professor at the University of Oregon detailed the growing problem of inaccuracy in mainstream newspapers. Maier argued that, under the twin pressures of shorter news cycles and smaller newsgathering operations, the quality of news coverage is under threat, an argument echoed by several speakers. Maier\u2018s and others\u2018 research suggests that the problem is broad, applying to both the American and European contexts.\nWhat then, does this changing news landscape mean for journalists, NGOs, and public diplomacy practitioners",

        "abstract": "Purpose: This paper examines the claim that the application of human factors (HF) knowledge can improve both human well-being and operations system performance.  \nMethodology:  A systematic review was conducted using a general and two specialist databases to identify empirical studies addressing both human effects and operations system effects in examining manufacturing operations system design aspects.\nFindings: We found 45 empirical studies addressing both the human effects and system effects of operations system (re)design.  Of those studies providing clear directional effects, 95% showed a convergence between human effects and system effects (+,+ or -,-),  5% showed a divergence of human and system effects (+,- or -,+).  System effects included quality, productivity, implementation performance of new technologies, and also more \u2018intangible\u2019 effects in terms of improved communication and co-operation.  Human effects included employee health, attitudes, physical workload, and \u2018quality of working life\u2019. \nResearch limitations/im",

        "abstract": "Switching operations of circuit breakers and disconnect switches generate transient currents propagating along the substation busbars. At the moment of switching, the busbars temporarily acts as antennae radiating transient electromagnetic fields within the substations. The radiated fields may interfere and disrupt normal operations of electronic equipment used within the substation for measurement, control and communication purposes. Hence there is the need to fully characterise the substation electromagnetic environment as early as the design stage of substation planning and operation to ensure safe operations of the electronic equipment. This paper deals with the computation of transient electromagnetic fields due to switching within a high voltage air-insulated substation (AIS) using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) metho",

We first show a general\napproach to cast this dynamic problem as a sequence of decentralized task\nallocation problems. Then we present two solutions both based on modeling the\nallocation task as a Markov Random Field to subsequently assess decisions by\nmeans of the decentralized Max-Sum algorithm. Our first solution assumes\nindependence between requests, whereas our second solution also considers the\nUAVs' workloads. A thorough empirical evaluation shows that our workload-based\nsolution consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in a wide\nrange of scenarios, lowering the average service time up to 16%. In the\nbest-case scenario there is no gap between our decentralized solution and\ncentralized techniques. In the worst-case scenario we manage to reduce by 25%\nthe gap between current decentralized and centralized techniques. Thus, our\nsolution becomes the method of choice for our problem",

        "abstract": "As a research field, artificial intelligence (AI) exists for several years. More recently, technological breakthroughs, coupled with the fast availability of data, have brought AI closer to commercial use. Internet giants such as Google, Amazon, Apple or Facebook invest significantly into AI, thereby underlining its relevance for business models worldwide. For the highly data driven finance industry, AI is of intensive interest within pilot projects, still, few AI applications have been implemented so far. This study analyzes drivers and inhibitors of a successful AI application in the finance industry based on panel data comprising 22 semi-structured interviews with experts in AI in finance. As theoretical lens, we structured our results using the TOE framework. Guidelines for applying AI successfully reveal AI-specific role models and process competencies as crucial, before trained algorithms will have reached a quality level on which AI applications will operate without human intervention and moral concerns",

        "abstract": "We are entering a new era of technological determinism and solutionism in which governments and business actors are seeking data-driven change, assuming that Artificial Intelligence is now inevitable and ubiquitous. But we have not even started asking the right questions, let alone developed an understanding of the consequences. Urgently needed is debate that asks and answers fundamental questions about power. This book brings together critical interrogations of what constitutes AI, its impact and its inequalities in order to offer an analysis of what it means for AI to deliver benefits for everyone. The book is structured in three parts: Part 1, AI: Humans vs. Machines, presents critical perspectives on human-machine dualism. Part 2, Discourses and Myths About AI, excavates metaphors and policies to ask normative questions about what is \u2018desirable\u2019 AI and what conditions make this possible. Part 3, AI Power and Inequalities, discusses how the implementation of AI creates important challenges that urgently need to be addressed. Bringing together scholars from diverse disciplinary backgrounds and regional contexts, this book offers a vital intervention on one of the most hyped concepts of our times",

        "abstract": "Recently, many AI researchers and practitioners have embarked on research\nvisions that involve doing AI for \"Good\". This is part of a general drive\ntowards infusing AI research and practice with ethical thinking. One frequent\ntheme in current ethical guidelines is the requirement that AI be good for all,\nor: contribute to the Common Good. But what is the Common Good, and is it\nenough to want to be good? Via four lead questions, I will illustrate\nchallenges and pitfalls when determining, from an AI point of view, what the\nCommon Good is and how it can be enhanced by AI. The questions are: What is the\nproblem / What is a problem?, Who defines the problem?, What is the role of\nknowledge?, and What are important side effects and dynamics? The illustration\nwill use an example from the domain of \"AI for Social Good\", more specifically\n\"Data Science for Social Good\". Even if the importance of these questions may\nbe known at an abstract level, they do not get asked sufficiently in practice,\nas shown by an exploratory study of 99 contributions to recent conferences in\nthe field. Turning these challenges and pitfalls into a positive\nrecommendation, as a conclusion I will draw on another characteristic of\ncomputer-science thinking and practice to make these impediments visible and\nattenuate them: \"attacks\" as a method for improving design. This results in the\nproposal of ethics pen-testing as a method for helping AI designs to better\ncontribute to the Common Good.Comment: to appear in Paladyn.

        "title": "The Promise and Peril: Unpacking the Impact of AI and Automation on Marginalized Communities",
        "abstract": "The 2023 Policy Papers analyze the impact of AI and automation on marginalized communities in three crucial areas: 1) In  Regulating Facial Recognition Technology to Reduce Bias  Khortlan Becton, JD, MTS, explores the urgent need to regulate AI to eradicate existing and potential policies and practices that dispro-portionately discriminate against African Americans and minorities. Becton proposes the creation of a new federal agency to regulate AI. 2) In  Automation and Artificial Intelligence in the Field of Social Work: Understanding Technology in Practice  Susan Elswick, EdD, LCSW, a faculty member in the University of Memphis School of Social Work, seeks a path to us-ing AI and Automation to provide social work counseling to those in need. Elswick not only explores how effective cli-ent counseling is dependent upon access and ability to use technology by clients but also argues that social workers require formal training from institutions of higher learning on how to use AI and automation to benefit their clients. 3) In  The Impact of Automation on Our Workforce  Meka Egwuekwe, MS, founder and executive director of Code Crew, approaches AI and automation from the per-spective of a practitioner who teaches others to write computer code. Recognizing that the world is experiencing a revolution in how work is performed, Egwuekwe proposes recommendations that reskill or upskill the workforce, increased support for startups and small businesses, and a societal framework that will embrace universal basic income as a resource to aid those displaced by AI and Automation",

        "abstract": "This paper considers sensemaking as it relates to everyday software engineering (SE) work practices and draws on a multi-year ethnographic study of SE projects at a large, global technology company building digital services infused with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) capabilities. Our findings highlight the breadth of sensemaking practices in AI/ML projects, noting developers' efforts to make sense of AI/ML environments (e.g., algorithms/methods and libraries), of AI/ML model ecosystems (e.g., pre-trained models and \"upstream\"models), and of business-AI relations (e.g., how the AI/ML service relates to the domain context and business problem at hand). This paper builds on recent scholarship drawing attention to the integral role of sensemaking in everyday SE practices by empirically investigating how and in what ways AI/ML projects present software teams with emergent sensemaking requirements and opportunities",

        "title": "Full-field and anomaly initialization using a low-order climate model: a comparison and proposals for advanced formulations",
        "abstract": "Initialization techniques for seasonal-to-decadal climate predictions fall into two main categories; namely full-field initialization (FFI) and anomaly initialization (AI). In the FFI case the initial model state is replaced by the best possible available estimate of the real state. By doing so the initial error is efficiently reduced but, due to the unavoidable presence of model deficiencies, once the model is let free to run a prediction, its trajectory drifts away from the observations no matter how small the initial error is. This problem is partly overcome with AI where the aim is to forecast future anomalies by assimilating observed anomalies on an estimate of the model climate.\n\n\n\nThe large variety of experimental setups, models and observational networks adopted worldwide make it difficult to draw firm conclusions on the respective advantages and drawbacks of FFI and AI, or to identify distinctive lines for improvement. The lack of a unified mathematical framework adds an additional difficulty toward the design of adequate initialization strategies that fit the desired forecast horizon, observational network and model at hand.\n\n\n\nHere we compare FFI and AI using a low-order climate model of nine ordinary differential equations and use the notation and concepts of data assimilation theory to highlight their error scaling properties. This analysis suggests better performances using FFI when a good observational network is available and reveals the direct relation of its skill with the observational accuracy. The skill of AI appears, however, mostly related to the model quality and clear increases of skill can only be expected in coincidence with model upgrades.\n\n\n\nWe have compared FFI and AI in experiments in which either the full system or the atmosphere and ocean were independently initialized. In the former case FFI shows better and longer-lasting improvements, with skillful predictions until month 30. In the initialization of single compartments, the best performance is obtained when the stabler component of the model (the ocean) is initialized, but with FFI it is possible to have some predictive skill even when the most unstable compartment (the extratropical atmosphere) is observed.\n\n\n\nTwo advanced formulations, least-square initialization (LSI) and exploring parameter uncertainty (EPU), are introduced. Using LSI the initialization makes use of model statistics to propagate information from observation locations to the entire model domain. Numerical results show that LSI improves the performance of FFI in all the situations when only a portion of the system's state is observed. EPU is an online drift correction method in which the drift caused by the parametric error is estimated using a short-time evolution law and is then removed during the forecast run. Its implementation in conjunction with FFI allows us to improve the prediction skill within the first forecast year.\n\n\n\nFinally, the application of these results in the context of realistic climate models is discussed",

        "title": "An Agent Based Model to Assess Crew Temporal Variability During U.S. Navy Shipboard Operations",
        "abstract": "Understanding the factors that affect human performance variability as well as their temporal impacts is an essential element in fully integrating and designing complex, adaptive environments. This understanding is particularly necessary for high stakes, time-critical routines such as those performed during nuclear reactor, air traffic control, and military operations. Over the last three decades significant efforts have emerged to demonstrate and apply a host of techniques to include Discrete Event Simulation, Bayesian Belief Networks, Neural Networks, and a multitude of existing software applications to provide relevant assessments of human task performance and temporal variability. The objective of this research was to design and develop a novel Agent Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) methodology to generate a timeline of work and assess impacts of crew temporal variability during U.S. Navy Small Boat Defense operations in littoral waters. The developed ABMS methodology included human performance models for six crew members (agents) as well as a threat craft, and incorporated varying levels of crew capability and task support. AnyLogic ABMS software was used to simultaneously provide detailed measures of individual sailor performance and of system-level emergent behavior. This methodology and these models were adapted and built to assure extensibility across a broad range of U.S. Navy shipboard operations. Application of the developed ABMS methodology effectively demonstrated a way to visualize and quantify impacts/uncertainties of human temporal variability on both workload and crew effectiveness during U.S. Navy shipboard operations",

        "abstract": "Knowledge is nowadays considered as a significant source of performance improvement, but may be difficult to identify, structure, analyse and reuse properly. A possible source of knowledge is in the data and information stored in various modules of industrial information systems, like CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management Systems) for maintenance. In that context, the main objective of this paper is to propose a framework allowing to manage and generate knowledge from information on past experiences, for improving the decisions related to the maintenance activity. In that purpose, we suggest an original Experience Feedback process dedicated to maintenance, allowing to capitalize on past interventions by i) formalizing the domain knowledge and experiences using a visual knowledge representation formalism with logical foundation (Conceptual Graphs); ii) extracting new knowledge thanks to association rules mining algorithms, using an innovative interactive approach; iii) interpreting and evaluating this new knowledge thanks to the reasoning operations of Conceptual Graphs. The suggested method is illustrated on a case study based on real data dealing with the maintenance of overhead cranes",

        "title": "Autonomous driving: a bird's eye view",
        "abstract": "[Abstract:] The introduction of autonomous vehicles (AV) will represent a milestone in the evolution of transportation and personal mobility. AVs are expected to significantly reduce accidents and congestion, while being economically and environmentally beneficial. However, many challenges must be overcome before reaching this ideal scenario. This study, which results from on-site visits to top research centres and a comprehensive literature review, provides an overall state-of-the-practice on the subject and identifies critical issues to succeed. For example, although most of the required technology is already available, ensuring the robustness of AVs under all boundary conditions is still a challenge. Additionally, the implementation of AVs must contribute to the environmental sustainability by promoting the usage of alternative energies and sustainable mobility patterns. Electric vehicles and sharing systems are suitable options, although both require some refinement to incentivise a broader range of customers. Other aspects could be more difficult to resolve and might even postpone the generalisation of automated driving. For instance, there is a need for cooperation and management strategies geared towards traffic efficiency. Also, for transportation and land-use planning to avoid negative territorial and economic impacts. Above all, safe and ethical behaviour rules must be agreed upon before AVs hit the road.Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Competitividad; TRA2016-79019-R/COO",

        "title": "GIS-based sustainability assessment of decentralized rural electrification in the Amazon region : case study Ecuador",
        "abstract": "Decentralized rural electrification (DRE) is necessary for electricity supplies in remote and disadvantaged areas in the Amazon region and improvement of the living conditions of the people there. However, the sustainability of DRE is often challenged by an unfavorable policy environment, limited institutional and organizational capacities, restricted financial resources, users' cultural attitudes and values as well as technology and environmental constraints. This study investigates how geographic information system (GIS) and system thinking can be linked for assessing and simulating the sustainability of DRE to enable stakeholders to explore policy scenarios to ensure a long-term electricity supply while improving the peoples' wellbeing and protecting the environment. Research objectives were accomplished by applying an interdisciplinary, participatory and multi-method approach in the Ecuadorian Amazon as a case study.  The aspects that favor or hinder sustainable operation of DRE in the Ecuadorian Amazon were identified through semi-structured interviews with decision makers and a survey in households using solar home systems (SHS). DRE is influenced by an intertwined network of technological, economic, social, institutional and environmental aspects. This complexity was disclosed through a participatory system analysis identifying DRE as a system of interconnected variables that form mostly reinforcing feedback structures without self-regulation. Thus, the provision of electricity in the Ecuadorian Amazon is perceived as an unstable system, not self-sufficient, and politically, technically and financially dependent on external inputs. Therefore, DRE needs to be carefully monitored to provide a basis for proactive and participatory management of a sustainable electricity system.  Linking GIS with fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCA) is demonstrated as being capable of capturing the complexity of DRE and assessing and simulating its sustainability in a participatory, systemic and spatial explicit manner. In a workshop with researchers, decision makers and the staff responsible for the solar program \u2018Yatsa Ii Etsari\u2019 in Morona Santiago, Ecuador, the viewpoints of the participants on sustainable DRE were integrated into a fuzzy cognitive map (system model) represented by a set of interconnected sustainability variables that allowed the simulation of the developing behavior of the DRE system and predicted future sustainability. Using data from the workshop and a household survey with users of SHS, MCA and GIS allowed the computation and mapping of sustainability for a spatial assessment of DRE at a regional scale and at different levels of aggregation, i.e. indicators, variables and sustainability indexes. The integration of GIS, FCM and MCA thus allowed scenario development and analysis in order to study long-term sustainability trends that might result from different interventions in the DRE system. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can be used to facilitate stakeholder discussions, as it immediately provides plausible outcomes and feedbacks that stakeholders can interpret and, if appropriate, they can revise or reset their ideas for policy interventions. The approach assesses DRE from perspectives other than the conventional, e.g. economic or technological, perspective and has the potential to serve as a learning tool for participatory decision making allowing insights that otherwise would not be possible.GIS-basierte Bewertung der Nachhaltigkeit dezentraler l\u00e4ndlicher Elektrifizierung im Amazonasbecken: Fallstudie Ecuador Dezentrale l\u00e4ndliche Elektrifizierung (DLE) spielt in den abgelegenen und unterentwickelten Gebieten Amazoniens eine wichtige Rolle, um die Stromversorgung zu gew\u00e4hrleisten und die Lebensqualit\u00e4t der Bev\u00f6lkerung zu verbessern. Jedoch wird die Nachhaltigkeit von DLE durch widrige politische Rahmenbedingungen, niedriger institutioneller Organisationsgrad, begrenzte finanzielle Ressourcen, kulturelle Eigenheiten und Wertesysteme der Nutzer sowie technologische und umweltbedingte Einschr\u00e4nkungen in Frage gestellt. Die vorliegende Studie untersucht, inwiefern geographische Informationssysteme (GIS) und Systemdenken in die Bewertung und Simulation der Nachhaltigkeit von DLE einflie\u00dfen k\u00f6nnen, um Stakeholders die M\u00f6glichkeit zu geben, politische Szenarien durchzuspielen und zu er\u00f6rtern, mit dem Ziel, die Stromversorgung langfristig zu sichern, die Lebensqualit\u00e4t der Bev\u00f6lkerung zu verbessern und die Umwelt zu sch\u00fctzen. Dabei kam ein interdisziplin\u00e4rer, partizipativer und multimethodischer Ansatz am Beispiel des ecuadorianischen Amazonasgebietes zur Anwendung. Die Faktoren, die eine nachhaltige Betreibung von DLE beg\u00fcnstigen, wurden durch Interviews mit Entscheidungstr\u00e4gern und Befragungen von Haushalten, die Solar Home Systems (SHS) nutzen, ermittelt. Die dezentrale l\u00e4ndliche Elektrifizierung wird von einem Netzwerk aus technologischen, \u00f6konomischen, sozialen, institutionellen und umweltbezogenen Faktoren beeinflusst. Diese Komplexit\u00e4t wurde in einer partizipativen Systemanalyse erfasst, die DLE als ein System von miteinander verbundenen Variablen darstellt, das vorrangig durch verst\u00e4rkende R\u00fcckkopplungseffekte ohne Selbstregulierung charakterisiert ist. Die Stromversorgung im ecuadorianischen Amazonasgebiet stellt ein instabiles System dar, das nicht autark ist und politisch, technisch und finanziell von externen Inputs abh\u00e4ngt. Daher muss DLE sorgf\u00e4ltig \u00fcberwacht werden, wodurch die Basis f\u00fcr ein proaktives und partizipatives Management geschaffen wird. Durch die Verkn\u00fcpfung von GIS mit Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) und Multi Criteria decision Analysis (MCA) konnte die Komplexizit\u00e4t von DLE aufgezeigt und deren Nachhaltigkeit partizipativ, systemisch und r\u00e4umlich explizit untersucht und simuliert werden. In einem Workshop in Morona Santiago, Ecuador, mit Wissenschaftlern, Entscheidungstr\u00e4gern und den Verantwortlichen des Solarenergieprogramms \u201eYatsa li Esari\u201c wurden die unterschiedlichen Einsch\u00e4tzungen von nachhaltigen DLE-Systemen als Nachhaltigkeitsvariablen in eine Fuzzy Cognitive Map\u201c (Systemmodel) integriert. Dadurch konnte das Entwicklungsverhalten von DLE-Systemen simuliert und deren Nachhaltigkeit prognostiziert werden. Die Verwendung von Daten aus dem Workshop und der Haushaltsbefragung mit Nutzern von SHS erm\u00f6glicht mit Hilfe von MCA und GIS die Simulierung und Kartierung der Nachhaltigkeit von DLE auf regionaler Ebene sowie auf verschiedenen Aggregationsebenen wie z.B. Indikatoren, Variablen und Nachhaltigkeitsindizes. Basierend auf der Integration von GIS, FCM und MCA konnten Szenarien erstellt und analysiert werden, die erlauben, die Nachhaltigkeit von DLE-Systemen unter verschiedenen Interventionen zu bewerten. Die Ergebnisse der Simulation zeigen, dass der beschriebene Ansatz Stakeholderdiskussionen insofern unterst\u00fctzt als unmittelbar m\u00f6gliche Auswirkungen und R\u00fcckkopplungen aufgezeigt werden, die dann von den Stakeholders interpretiert werden und, wenn n\u00f6tig, die Revision von geplanten politischen Interventionen erm\u00f6glichen. Der Ansatz beleuchtet DLE von einer Perspektive, die \u00fcber die konventionellen \u00f6konomischen und technologischen Betrachtungen hinaus geht. Er kann als Lernansatz f\u00fcr partizipative Entscheidungsprozesse genutzt werden und erm\u00f6glicht damit Erkenntnisse, die andernfalls nicht h\u00e4tten gewonnen werden k\u00f6nne",

        "title": "Can Patient Safety Incident Reports Be Used to Compare Hospital Safety? Results from a Quantitative Analysis of the English National Reporting and Learning System Data.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) collects reports about patient safety incidents in England. Government regulators use NRLS data to assess the safety of hospitals. This study aims to examine whether annual hospital incident reporting rates can be used as a surrogate indicator of individual hospital safety. Secondly assesses which hospital characteristics are correlated with high incident reporting rates and whether a high reporting hospital is safer than those lower reporting hospitals. Finally, it assesses which health-care professionals report more incidents of patient harm, which report more near miss incidents and what hospital factors encourage reporting. These findings may suggest methods for increasing the utility of reporting systems. METHODS: This study used a mix methods approach for assessing NRLS data. The data were investigated using Pareto analysis and regression models to establish which patients are most vulnerable to reported harm. Hospital factors were correlated with institutional reporting rates over one year to examine what factors influenced reporting. Staff survey findings regarding hospital safety culture were correlated with reported rates of incidents causing harm; no harm and death to understand what barriers influence error disclosure. FINDINGS: 5,879,954 incident reports were collected from acute hospitals over the decade. 70.3% of incidents produced no harm to the patient and 0.9% were judged by the reporter to have caused severe harm or death. Obstetrics and Gynaecology reported the most no harm events [OR 1.61(95%CI: 1.12 to 2.27), p<0.01] and pharmacy was the hospital location where most near-misses were captured [OR 3.03(95%CI: 2.04 to 4.55), p<0.01]. Clinicians were significantly more likely to report death than other staff [OR 3.04(95%CI: 2.43 to 3.80) p<0.01]. A higher ratio of clinicians to beds correlated with reduced rate of harm reported [RR = -1.78(95%Cl: -3.33 to -0.23), p = 0.03]. Litigation claims per bed were significantly negatively associated with incident reports. Patient satisfaction and mortality outcomes were not significantly associated with reporting rates. Staff survey responses revealed that keeping reports confidential, keeping staff informed about incidents and giving feedback on safety initiatives increased reporting rates [r = 0.26 (p<0.01), r = 0.17 (p = 0.04), r = 0.23 (p = 0.01), r = 0.20 (p = 0.02)]. CONCLUSION: The NRLS is the largest patient safety reporting system in the world. This study did not demonstrate many hospital characteristics to significantly influence overall reporting rate. There were no association between size of hospital, number of staff, mortality outcomes or patient satisfaction outcomes and incident reporting rate. The study did show that hospitals where staff reported more incidents had reduced litigation claims and when clinician staffing is increased fewer incidents reporting patient harm are reported, whilst near misses remain the same. Certain specialties report more near misses than others, and doctors report more harm incidents than near misses. Staff survey results showed that open environments and reduced fear of punitive response increases incident reporting. We suggest that reporting rates should not be used to assess hospital safety. Different healthcare professionals focus on different types of safety incidents and focusing on these areas whilst creating a responsive, confidential learning environment will increase staff engagement with error disclosure",

        "abstract": "__Abstract__\n\n\n\nThe publication of the breakthrough report \u201cTo Err is Human\u201d by the Institute of Medicine was the\n\nlaunch of patient safety initiatives all over the world. In the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Erasmus\n\nMC-Sophia Children\u2019s Hospital this resulted in the institution of a multimodal patient safety management\n\nsystem under the name Safety First in 2005. This system now includes nine major elements,\n\nrepresenting monitoring and intervention activities. In this thesis we report on the results and the\n\nimplementation of the patient safety management system called Safety First.\n\n\n\n__Outline of this thesis:__\n\nIn part I the concept of patient safety and the Safety First project are introduced. The rationale for\n\nselecting the elements of the patient safety management system is explained. As preventable mortality\n\nand morbidity are the public focus as outcome parameters for quality and safety of care, we\n\nhave studied very long stay patients in our ICU (chapter 2). The goal of this study was to determine\n\ncharacteristics and mortality in these patients as well as modes of death. Chapter 3 presents an evaluation\n\nof potentially preventable deaths in our ICU. An important question was whether five years\n\nof patient safety efforts had resulted in fewer potentially preventable deaths.\n\nPart II reflects on the difficulties in monitoring adverse events. In chapter 4 we present numbers and\n\ntypes of adverse events identified with real time physicians\u2019 registration during a 3-month period in\n\ngeneral pediatric practice. The next chapter is a study into adverse events in the surgical pediatric\n\nICU in a 2-year period. We combined the physicians\u2019 registration with the Trigger Tool methodology\n\nas developed by the Institute for Healthcare, Boston, USA. The goals were to determine the rate and\n\nnature of the adverse events and to compare the two methods.\n\nIn part III a number of elements of Safety First are described, as well as other studies into patient\n\nsafety issues relevant to bedside ICU care. Chapter 6 brings the results of critical incident analysis\n\nwith a focus on the factors contributing to the incident and the resultant recommendations. The\n\nnext study evaluated the availability and reliability of drug formularies used in our ICU, which are\n\ncrucial in safe drug prescription. In chapter 8 we discuss the safety of routine MRI scans in preterm\n\ninfants at 30 weeks gestational age, as reflected by safety incidents and adverse events. In the next\n\nchapter, safety focused Mortality and Morbidity conference reports were scrutinized for numbers\n\nand types of recommendations stemming from these meetings. Chapter 10 is a study about nursing\n\nprotocol violations established with the Critical Nursing Situation Index.\n\nPart IV describes a study of safety culture in the ICU, as it emerged from a safety attitude questionnaire\n\nadministered to all staff. We aimed to compare findings to benchmark data and explore any\n\ndeficiencies.\n\nIn the general discussion in part V the results of the studies are commented on and future directions\n\nare given, including guidelines for optimal implementation of a patient safety management system\n\nand future benchmarking",

        "abstract": "Incident reporting as a key mechanism for organisational learning and the establishment of a stronger safety culture are pillars of the current patient safety movement.  Studies have suggested that incident reporting in healthcare does not achieve its full potential due to serious barriers to reporting and that sometimes staff may feel alienated by the process.  The aim of the work reported in this paper was to prototype a novel approach to organisational learning that allows an organisation to assess and to monitor the status of processes that often give rise to latent failure conditions in the work environment, and to assess whether and through which mechanisms participation in this approach affects local safety culture.  The approach was prototyped in a hospital dispensary using Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles, and the effect on safety culture was described qualitatively through semi-structured interviews.  The results suggest that the approach has had a positive effect on the safety culture within the dispensary, and that staff perceive the approach to be useful and usable",

        "abstract": "The Report was commissioned by the European Federation of Nurses Associations (EFN) in November 2007 in order to support its policy statements on Patient Safety (June 2004). In that statement the EFN declares its belief that European Union health services should operate within a culture of safety that is based on working towards an open culture and the immediate reporting of mistakes; exchanging best practice and research; and lobbying for the systematic collection of information and dissemination of research findings. This Report adressess specifically the culture of highly reliable organisations using the work of James Reason (2000). Medication errors and hospital-acquired infections are examined in line with the Reprt\u00b4s parameters and a range of European studies are used as evidence. An extensive reference list is provided that allows EFN to explore work in greater detail as required",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To examine the characteristics of incidents reported after introduction of a voluntary, non-punitive incident reporting system for neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in the Netherlands; and to investigate which types of reported incident pose the highest risk to patients in the NICU. DESIGN: Prospective multicentre survey. METHODS: Voluntary, non-punitive incident reporting was introduced in eight level III NICUs and one paediatric surgical ICU. An incident was defined as any unintended event which (could have) reduced the safety margin for the patient. Multidisciplinary, unit-based patient safety committees systematically collected and analysed incident reports, and assigned risk scores to each reported incident. Data were centrally collected for specialty-based analysis. This paper describes the characteristics of incidents reported during the first year. Bivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify high-risk incident categories. RESULTS: There were 5225 incident reports on 3859 admissions, of which 4846 were eligible for analysis. Incidents with medication were most frequently reported (27%), followed by laboratory (10%) and enteral nutrition (8%). Severe harm was described in seven incident reports, and moderate harm in 63 incident reports. Incidents involving mechanical ventilation and blood products were most likely to be assigned high-risk scores, followed by those involving parenteral nutrition, intravascular lines and medication dosing errors. CONCLUSIONS: Incidents occur much more frequently in Dutch NICUs than has been previously observed, and their impact on patient morbidity is considerable. Reported incidents concerning mechanical ventilation, blood products, intravascular lines, parenteral nutrition and medication dosing errors pose the highest risk to patients in the NIC",

        "abstract": "Recent laboratory based studies have demonstrated adverse sub-lethal effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on honey bees and bumble bees, and these studies have been influential in leading to a European Union moratorium on the use of three neonicotinoids, clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam on \u201cbee attractive\u201d crops. Yet so far, these same effects have not been observed in field studies. Here we review the three key dosage factors (concentration, duration and choice) relevant to field conditions, and conclude that these have probably been over estimated in many laboratory based studies",
