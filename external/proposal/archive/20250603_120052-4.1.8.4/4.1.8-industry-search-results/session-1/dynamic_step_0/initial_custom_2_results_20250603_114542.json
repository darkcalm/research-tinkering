      "abstract": "Climate change is a pressing global issue caused by increasing greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels for energy generation. The deployment of renewable generation is essential to mitigate climate change as it offers a sustainable and clean alternative energy. Following the success of bottom fixed wind, developers are looking to deeper waters to expand current development. This thesis delves into the complexities and challenges associated with the operation and maintenance of floating offshore wind farms. The research explores the unique hurdles presented by harnessing wind energy in deeper waters, such as increased distance to shore and uncharted areas. Floating wind sites also introduce specific operational challenges due to the\nmotion of the turbine which has a significant impact on the way in which offshore sites are both operated and maintained. This work consists of three distinct parts: identifying challenges, quantifying their impact, and proposing potential mitigating strategies. Through analysis and modelling of operational expenditure, the study identifies key challenges faced during the maintenance of floating wind farms, with a focus on technology-specific issues arising from turbine motion. Based on a review of current technology, future markets of deployment, and current operational challenges: location, scale, design convergence and turbine motion are identified as the key areas which are set to have a significant impact on the operation of future floating offshore sites. After identifying the challenges, their impact on the operational phase of the project is quantified. Through the use of offshore wind key performance indicators, the accessibility and total operational expenditure are determined for floating wind against an equivalent bottom fixed wind site. This then has a potentially significant impact on lost revenue which increases total cost. The increase in lost revenue is a result of reduced access due to additional restrictions placed on accessible conditions during specific turbine motion.\nAdditionally, the thesis quantifies the operational impact of these challenges and explores potential maintenance strategies to reduce OPEX, including the concept of opportunistic maintenance.

      "title": "Maintenance optimisation for wind turbines.",
      "abstract": "Wind is becoming an increasingly important source of energy for countries that ratify to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and mitigate the effects of global warming. Investments in wind farms are affected by inter-related assets and stakeholders requirements. These requirements demand a well-founded Asset Management (AM) frame-work which is currently lacking in the wind industry. Drawing from processes, tools and techniques of AM in other industries, a structured model for AM in the wind industry is developed. The model divulges that maintenance is indispensable to the core business objectives of the wind industry. However, the common maintenance strategies applied to wind turbines are inadequate to support the current commercial drivers of the wind industry. Consequently, a hybrid approach to the selection of a suitable maintenance strategy is developed. The approach is used in a case study to demonstrate its practical application. Suitable Condition-Based Maintenance activities for wind turbines are determined. Maintenance optimisation is a means to determine the most cost-effective maintenance strategy. Field failure and maintenance data of wind turbines are collected and analysed using two quantitative maintenance optimisation techniques; Modelling System Failures (MSF) and Delay-Time Maintenance Model (DTMM). The MSF permits the evaluation of life-data samples and enables the design and simulation of a systems model to determine optimum maintenance activities. Maximum Likelihood Estimation is used to estimate the shape (\u00ce\u00b2) and scale (\u00ce\u00b7) parameters of the Weibull distribution for critical components and subsystems of the wind turbines. Reliability Block Diagrams are designed using the estimated \u00ce\u00b2 and \u00ce\u00b7 to model the failures of the wind turbines and of a selected wind farm. The models are simulated to assess and optimise the reliability, availability and maintainability of the wind turbine and the farm. The DTMM examines equipment failure patterns by taking into account failure consequences, inspection time and cost in order to determine optimum inspection intervals. Defects rate (\u00ce\u00b1) and mean delay-time (1/\u00ce\u00b3) of components and subsystems within the wind turbine are estimated. Optimal inspection intervals for critical subsystems of the wind turbine are then determined",

      "abstract": "For offshore wind farms, a move from a preventive and corrective maintenance regime to a predictive maintenance regime requires new methods for modelling approaches for maritime logistics planning. This paper presents an overview of the maritime logistics planning problem for a predictive maintenance regime and introduces the current state-of-the-art for operational research in the field of operation and maintenance at offshore wind farms. Findings are that a combination of the vessel resource scheduling problem for operation and maintenance at offshore wind farms with predictive analysis and digital twins is a promising future research step. A framework for a decision support tool is presented that will help bridge the gap, both with respect to the academic path, and the gap between academic research and industry.publishedVersio",

      "title": "Modelling analysis of maintenance logistics optimization for a floating wind park: A case study for Utsira Nord",
      "abstract": "The global society is part of a climate challenge that requires the development of will, understanding and technology. The United Nations has given the climate challenge its sustainability goal, saying, \"Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\" [1]. There will not be sufficiently developed energy production today in the context of future electrification of the Norwegian everyday life and industry. Norway needs to invest in more green energy production not to become an import nation of energy, but; an export nation. On June 12th, 2020, the Utsira Nord area was opened by the Government by royal decree for energy production from floating offshore wind [2]. \n\nBy taking a closer look at the well-known concept of Operating expenditures, one can see clear advantages and challenges related to floating offshore wind [3]. It shows how important it is to optimise the maintenance strategy for the industry, and this is the basis for this thesis. There are many logistics solutions, and many factors influencing the choice that is hard to know beforehand. Therefore, it will depend on each wind farm to decide the best alternative to provide maintenance services. Hence, this thesis aims to investigate the following questions:\n\u2022\tHow to utilize modelling and simulation method for selection of optimal maintenance logistics strategy for a wind farm at Utsira Nord\n\u2022\tWhat will be an optimal maintenance logistics strategy for an imaginary Utsira Nord wind farm, seen from cost-benefit perspective and emission perspective\n\nA case study has been carried out based on an imaginary wind farm at Utsira Nord to answer the research questions. Shoreline software is used to create simulations, and analyses potential technical solutions. The research is executed in the following steps: (1) extract stakeholder requirements and acceptance criteria and define the purpose of the simulation model, (2) systems analysis of the wind park, maintenance program and logistic vessels, (3) collect and extract failure and maintenance data from existing offshore wind parks, (4) collect technical and economic data for several logistic maintenance vessels, (5) design and prepare the simulation cases, (6) perform the simulation cases and visualise the results, (7) verification and validation, including sensitivity analysis and (8) evaluate and select the most optimal logistic vessel alternative based on cost/availability and emissions\n\n\nWhen it comes to the most optimal vessel for the case wind park, the result clearly shows that the service operation vessel provides more benefits in terms of overall grading for cost/availability and emissions. It comes out far better than the crew transfer vessel because of the sensitivity associated with the maximum wave height for this vessel. This causes a significantly higher downtime for the wind farm, and the analysis shows that the case can increase its turnover by \u20ac 13,844,000 by using a service operation vessel in favour of a crew transfer vessel concerning lost production.\n\nThe method used to carry out the analysis and simulation can be used as a starting point to provide the most optimal maintenance logistics strategy for each park. It can be common service operation vessel for several parks within the same field, several crew transfer vessels or make use of other logistical possibilities such as helicopters",

      "abstract": "This thesis explores the regulatory and strategic impacts of the Jones Act on the transport and installation of wind turbine generators in the U.S. offshore wind industry. The research specifically addresses two primary questions:  \n\u2022How does the Jones Act impact the transport and installation of wind turbine generators in the U.S. offshore wind industry? \n\u2022What is the best overall solution to comply with Jones Act, for transport and installation of wind turbine generators in the U.S.?  \nThe U.S. has significant ambitions to expand its offshore wind capacity, with a federal target to deploy 30 gigawatts by 2030. The Jones Act, a century-old maritime law, presents both challenges and opportunities in this context. It requires that transportation between U.S. ports is performed by U.S. flagged vessels, which has significant impact on the transport and installation of wind turbine generators for offshore wind farm developments in the U.S. This study identifies two main methods for transport and installation of wind turbine generators: \n\u2022U.S. flagged Wind Turbine Installation Vessel  \n\u2022Foreign flagged Wind Turbine Installation Vessel with feeder barges \nThe thesis is based on a qualitative method using semi structured interviews with four key strategic stakeholders from the industry. This research is organized by using the Gioia method and supported by established guidelines about how to do qualitative research and case studies.\nThe thesis concludes that neither of the strategies are clearly better than the other across all aspects. The strategic decisions must consider specific project needs, stakeholder priorities, and the regulatory landscape. However, based on the favorable operational workability, this thesis outlines the U.S. flagged installation vessel as the best solution in the long-term perspective, despite the higher upfront capital investment. On the other hand, the foreign-flagged WTIVs with feeder barges present a lower upfront investment but may lead to increased operational complexities and challenges",

      "title": "Time series semi-Markov decision process with variable costs for maintenance planning",
      "abstract": "Deciding when and how to maintain offshore wind turbines is becoming even more complex as the size of wind farms increases, while accessibility is challenging compared to onshore wind farms. Planning future maintenance actions requires the wind farm operator to consider factors such as the current condition of the turbine, the cost of a given maintenance action, revenue generated by the asset, weather factors and vessel availability. Rather than making case-by-case decisions for each turbine, the approach described in this paper allows the wind farm operators to automate the process of short to-medium term maintenance planning through application of a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP). The model proposed here is capable of suggesting the cost-optimal maintenance policy given weather forecast, future vessel costs and availability and the current condition of the turbine. Using the semi-Markov approach, allows the user to implement time varying failure rate. As the model is capable of utilising time-series data, future weather and vessel constraints can be applied depending on the information available to the user at the time, which will be reflected in the optimal policy suggested by the model. The model proposed here facilitates maintenance decision making in wind farms and will lead to cost reduction through more efficient planning. In addition to that, the model can be used to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of using vessels with different properties",

      "title": "Maintenance optimisation for wind turbines.",
      "abstract": "Wind is becoming an increasingly important source of energy for countries that ratify to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and mitigate the effects of global warming. Investments in wind farms are affected by inter-related assets and stakeholders requirements. These requirements demand a well-founded Asset Management (AM) frame-work which is currently lacking in the wind industry. Drawing from processes, tools and techniques of AM in other industries, a structured model for AM in the wind industry is developed. The model divulges that maintenance is indispensable to the core business objectives of the wind industry. However, the common maintenance strategies applied to wind turbines are inadequate to support the current commercial drivers of the wind industry. Consequently, a hybrid approach to the selection of a suitable maintenance strategy is developed. The approach is used in a case study to demonstrate its practical application. Suitable Condition-Based Maintenance activities for wind turbines are determined. Maintenance optimisation is a means to determine the most cost-effective maintenance strategy. Field failure and maintenance data of wind turbines are collected and analysed using two quantitative maintenance optimisation techniques; Modelling System Failures (MSF) and Delay-Time Maintenance Model (DTMM). The MSF permits the evaluation of life-data samples and enables the design and simulation of a systems model to determine optimum maintenance activities. Maximum Likelihood Estimation is used to estimate the shape (\u00ce\u00b2) and scale (\u00ce\u00b7) parameters of the Weibull distribution for critical components and subsystems of the wind turbines. Reliability Block Diagrams are designed using the estimated \u00ce\u00b2 and \u00ce\u00b7 to model the failures of the wind turbines and of a selected wind farm. The models are simulated to assess and optimise the reliability, availability and maintainability of the wind turbine and the farm. The DTMM examines equipment failure patterns by taking into account failure consequences, inspection time and cost in order to determine optimum inspection intervals. Defects rate (\u00ce\u00b1) and mean delay-time (1/\u00ce\u00b3) of components and subsystems within the wind turbine are estimated. Optimal inspection intervals for critical subsystems of the wind turbine are then determined",

      "title": "Modelling analysis of maintenance logistics optimization for a floating wind park: A case study for Utsira Nord",
      "abstract": "The global society is part of a climate challenge that requires the development of will, understanding and technology. The United Nations has given the climate challenge its sustainability goal, saying, \"Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\" [1]. There will not be sufficiently developed energy production today in the context of future electrification of the Norwegian everyday life and industry. Norway needs to invest in more green energy production not to become an import nation of energy, but; an export nation. On June 12th, 2020, the Utsira Nord area was opened by the Government by royal decree for energy production from floating offshore wind [2]. \n\nBy taking a closer look at the well-known concept of Operating expenditures, one can see clear advantages and challenges related to floating offshore wind [3]. It shows how important it is to optimise the maintenance strategy for the industry, and this is the basis for this thesis. There are many logistics solutions, and many factors influencing the choice that is hard to know beforehand. Therefore, it will depend on each wind farm to decide the best alternative to provide maintenance services. Hence, this thesis aims to investigate the following questions:\n\u2022\tHow to utilize modelling and simulation method for selection of optimal maintenance logistics strategy for a wind farm at Utsira Nord\n\u2022\tWhat will be an optimal maintenance logistics strategy for an imaginary Utsira Nord wind farm, seen from cost-benefit perspective and emission perspective\n\nA case study has been carried out based on an imaginary wind farm at Utsira Nord to answer the research questions. Shoreline software is used to create simulations, and analyses potential technical solutions. The research is executed in the following steps: (1) extract stakeholder requirements and acceptance criteria and define the purpose of the simulation model, (2) systems analysis of the wind park, maintenance program and logistic vessels, (3) collect and extract failure and maintenance data from existing offshore wind parks, (4) collect technical and economic data for several logistic maintenance vessels, (5) design and prepare the simulation cases, (6) perform the simulation cases and visualise the results, (7) verification and validation, including sensitivity analysis and (8) evaluate and select the most optimal logistic vessel alternative based on cost/availability and emissions\n\n\nWhen it comes to the most optimal vessel for the case wind park, the result clearly shows that the service operation vessel provides more benefits in terms of overall grading for cost/availability and emissions. It comes out far better than the crew transfer vessel because of the sensitivity associated with the maximum wave height for this vessel. This causes a significantly higher downtime for the wind farm, and the analysis shows that the case can increase its turnover by \u20ac 13,844,000 by using a service operation vessel in favour of a crew transfer vessel concerning lost production.\n\nThe method used to carry out the analysis and simulation can be used as a starting point to provide the most optimal maintenance logistics strategy for each park. It can be common service operation vessel for several parks within the same field, several crew transfer vessels or make use of other logistical possibilities such as helicopters",

      "title": "Time series semi-Markov decision process with variable costs for maintenance planning",
      "abstract": "Deciding when and how to maintain offshore wind turbines is becoming even more complex as the size of wind farms increases, while accessibility is challenging compared to onshore wind farms. Planning future maintenance actions requires the wind farm operator to consider factors such as the current condition of the turbine, the cost of a given maintenance action, revenue generated by the asset, weather factors and vessel availability. Rather than making case-by-case decisions for each turbine, the approach described in this paper allows the wind farm operators to automate the process of short to-medium term maintenance planning through application of a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP). The model proposed here is capable of suggesting the cost-optimal maintenance policy given weather forecast, future vessel costs and availability and the current condition of the turbine. Using the semi-Markov approach, allows the user to implement time varying failure rate. As the model is capable of utilising time-series data, future weather and vessel constraints can be applied depending on the information available to the user at the time, which will be reflected in the optimal policy suggested by the model. The model proposed here facilitates maintenance decision making in wind farms and will lead to cost reduction through more efficient planning. In addition to that, the model can be used to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of using vessels with different properties",

      "abstract": "Climate change is a pressing global issue caused by increasing greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels for energy generation. The deployment of renewable generation is essential to mitigate climate change as it offers a sustainable and clean alternative energy. Following the success of bottom fixed wind, developers are looking to deeper waters to expand current development. This thesis delves into the complexities and challenges associated with the operation and maintenance of floating offshore wind farms. The research explores the unique hurdles presented by harnessing wind energy in deeper waters, such as increased distance to shore and uncharted areas. Floating wind sites also introduce specific operational challenges due to the\nmotion of the turbine which has a significant impact on the way in which offshore sites are both operated and maintained. This work consists of three distinct parts: identifying challenges, quantifying their impact, and proposing potential mitigating strategies. Through analysis and modelling of operational expenditure, the study identifies key challenges faced during the maintenance of floating wind farms, with a focus on technology-specific issues arising from turbine motion. Based on a review of current technology, future markets of deployment, and current operational challenges: location, scale, design convergence and turbine motion are identified as the key areas which are set to have a significant impact on the operation of future floating offshore sites. After identifying the challenges, their impact on the operational phase of the project is quantified. Through the use of offshore wind key performance indicators, the accessibility and total operational expenditure are determined for floating wind against an equivalent bottom fixed wind site. This then has a potentially significant impact on lost revenue which increases total cost. The increase in lost revenue is a result of reduced access due to additional restrictions placed on accessible conditions during specific turbine motion.\nAdditionally, the thesis quantifies the operational impact of these challenges and explores potential maintenance strategies to reduce OPEX, including the concept of opportunistic maintenance. The study introduces the OM+ framework, which identifies market-based opportunities for maintenance, aiming to enhance cost-effectiveness and efficiency. The thesis concludes with a comprehensive summary of the research findings and recommendations for future work, contributing to a sustainable and reliable renewable energy solution for the global energy landscape.Climate change is a pressing global issue caused by increasing greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels for energy generation.

The aim of this paper is to investigate if the floating foundation technology offers new\r\napproaches for the way offshore wind power plants are operated and maintained. The possibility to return the semisubmersible\r\nwind turbine to shore, allows that maintenance activities could be carried out near to shore (for\r\nexample in a dry dock) with fewer restrictions and lower cost. The point of interest therefore is, to what extent it\r\nis technical and economical feasible to perform \u201coffshore\u201d maintenance in comparison with \u201conshore\u201d\r\nmaintenance for which the floating platform needs to be repositioned. This was studied by comparing the cost for\r\neach O&M strategy. Weather restrictions, distance to shore and the technology readiness level influence both\r\nconcepts. In general, it can be concluded that with the current technology level, returning a semi-submersible\r\nfloating wind turbine for scheduled maintenance campaigns on a regular basis is not an economical and technical\r\nfeasible approach. Keeping in mind, that the floating wind turbine technology is still in the prototype and precommercial\r\nphase, this also concludes that there is still large potential for improvement",

Hence, this thesis aims to investigate the following questions:\n\u2022\tHow to utilize modelling and simulation method for selection of optimal maintenance logistics strategy for a wind farm at Utsira Nord\n\u2022\tWhat will be an optimal maintenance logistics strategy for an imaginary Utsira Nord wind farm, seen from cost-benefit perspective and emission perspective\n\nA case study has been carried out based on an imaginary wind farm at Utsira Nord to answer the research questions. Shoreline software is used to create simulations, and analyses potential technical solutions. The research is executed in the following steps: (1) extract stakeholder requirements and acceptance criteria and define the purpose of the simulation model, (2) systems analysis of the wind park, maintenance program and logistic vessels, (3) collect and extract failure and maintenance data from existing offshore wind parks, (4) collect technical and economic data for several logistic maintenance vessels, (5) design and prepare the simulation cases, (6) perform the simulation cases and visualise the results, (7) verification and validation, including sensitivity analysis and (8) evaluate and select the most optimal logistic vessel alternative based on cost/availability and emissions\n\n\nWhen it comes to the most optimal vessel for the case wind park, the result clearly shows that the service operation vessel provides more benefits in terms of overall grading for cost/availability and emissions. It comes out far better than the crew transfer vessel because of the sensitivity associated with the maximum wave height for this vessel. This causes a significantly higher downtime for the wind farm, and the analysis shows that the case can increase its turnover by \u20ac 13,844,000 by using a service operation vessel in favour of a crew transfer vessel concerning lost production.\n\nThe method used to carry out the analysis and simulation can be used as a starting point to provide the most optimal maintenance logistics strategy for each park. It can be common service operation vessel for several parks within the same field, several crew transfer vessels or make use of other logistical possibilities such as helicopters",

      "title": "Time series semi-Markov decision process with variable costs for maintenance planning",
      "abstract": "Deciding when and how to maintain offshore wind turbines is becoming even more complex as the size of wind farms increases, while accessibility is challenging compared to onshore wind farms. Planning future maintenance actions requires the wind farm operator to consider factors such as the current condition of the turbine, the cost of a given maintenance action, revenue generated by the asset, weather factors and vessel availability. Rather than making case-by-case decisions for each turbine, the approach described in this paper allows the wind farm operators to automate the process of short to-medium term maintenance planning through application of a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP). The model proposed here is capable of suggesting the cost-optimal maintenance policy given weather forecast, future vessel costs and availability and the current condition of the turbine. Using the semi-Markov approach, allows the user to implement time varying failure rate. As the model is capable of utilising time-series data, future weather and vessel constraints can be applied depending on the information available to the user at the time, which will be reflected in the optimal policy suggested by the model. The model proposed here facilitates maintenance decision making in wind farms and will lead to cost reduction through more efficient planning. In addition to that, the model can be used to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of using vessels with different properties",

      "abstract": "Climate change is a pressing global issue caused by increasing greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels for energy generation. The deployment of renewable generation is essential to mitigate climate change as it offers a sustainable and clean alternative energy. Following the success of bottom fixed wind, developers are looking to deeper waters to expand current development. This thesis delves into the complexities and challenges associated with the operation and maintenance of floating offshore wind farms. The research explores the unique hurdles presented by harnessing wind energy in deeper waters, such as increased distance to shore and uncharted areas. Floating wind sites also introduce specific operational challenges due to the\nmotion of the turbine which has a significant impact on the way in which offshore sites are both operated and maintained. This work consists of three distinct parts: identifying challenges, quantifying their impact, and proposing potential mitigating strategies. Through analysis and modelling of operational expenditure, the study identifies key challenges faced during the maintenance of floating wind farms, with a focus on technology-specific issues arising from turbine motion. Based on a review of current technology, future markets of deployment, and current operational challenges: location, scale, design convergence and turbine motion are identified as the key areas which are set to have a significant impact on the operation of future floating offshore sites. After identifying the challenges, their impact on the operational phase of the project is quantified. Through the use of offshore wind key performance indicators, the accessibility and total operational expenditure are determined for floating wind against an equivalent bottom fixed wind site. This then has a potentially significant impact on lost revenue which increases total cost. The increase in lost revenue is a result of reduced access due to additional restrictions placed on accessible conditions during specific turbine motion.\nAdditionally, the thesis quantifies the operational impact of these challenges and explores potential maintenance strategies to reduce OPEX, including the concept of opportunistic maintenance. The study introduces the OM+ framework, which identifies market-based opportunities for maintenance, aiming to enhance cost-effectiveness and efficiency.

The aim of this paper is to investigate if the floating foundation technology offers new\r\napproaches for the way offshore wind power plants are operated and maintained. The possibility to return the semisubmersible\r\nwind turbine to shore, allows that maintenance activities could be carried out near to shore (for\r\nexample in a dry dock) with fewer restrictions and lower cost. The point of interest therefore is, to what extent it\r\nis technical and economical feasible to perform \u201coffshore\u201d maintenance in comparison with \u201conshore\u201d\r\nmaintenance for which the floating platform needs to be repositioned. This was studied by comparing the cost for\r\neach O&M strategy. Weather restrictions, distance to shore and the technology readiness level influence both\r\nconcepts. In general, it can be concluded that with the current technology level, returning a semi-submersible\r\nfloating wind turbine for scheduled maintenance campaigns on a regular basis is not an economical and technical\r\nfeasible approach. Keeping in mind, that the floating wind turbine technology is still in the prototype and precommercial\r\nphase, this also concludes that there is still large potential for improvement",

      "title": "Maintenance optimisation for wind turbines.",
      "abstract": "Wind is becoming an increasingly important source of energy for countries that ratify to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and mitigate the effects of global warming. Investments in wind farms are affected by inter-related assets and stakeholders requirements. These requirements demand a well-founded Asset Management (AM) frame-work which is currently lacking in the wind industry. Drawing from processes, tools and techniques of AM in other industries, a structured model for AM in the wind industry is developed. The model divulges that maintenance is indispensable to the core business objectives of the wind industry. However, the common maintenance strategies applied to wind turbines are inadequate to support the current commercial drivers of the wind industry. Consequently, a hybrid approach to the selection of a suitable maintenance strategy is developed. The approach is used in a case study to demonstrate its practical application. Suitable Condition-Based Maintenance activities for wind turbines are determined. Maintenance optimisation is a means to determine the most cost-effective maintenance strategy. Field failure and maintenance data of wind turbines are collected and analysed using two quantitative maintenance optimisation techniques; Modelling System Failures (MSF) and Delay-Time Maintenance Model (DTMM). The MSF permits the evaluation of life-data samples and enables the design and simulation of a systems model to determine optimum maintenance activities. Maximum Likelihood Estimation is used to estimate the shape (\u00ce\u00b2) and scale (\u00ce\u00b7) parameters of the Weibull distribution for critical components and subsystems of the wind turbines. Reliability Block Diagrams are designed using the estimated \u00ce\u00b2 and \u00ce\u00b7 to model the failures of the wind turbines and of a selected wind farm. The models are simulated to assess and optimise the reliability, availability and maintainability of the wind turbine and the farm. The DTMM examines equipment failure patterns by taking into account failure consequences, inspection time and cost in order to determine optimum inspection intervals. Defects rate (\u00ce\u00b1) and mean delay-time (1/\u00ce\u00b3) of components and subsystems within the wind turbine are estimated. Optimal inspection intervals for critical subsystems of the wind turbine are then determined",

The United Nations has given the climate challenge its sustainability goal, saying, \"Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\" [1].

Norway needs to invest in more green energy production not to become an import nation of energy, but; an export nation.

The Jones Act, a century-old maritime law, presents both challenges and opportunities in this context. It requires that transportation between U.S. ports is performed by U.S. flagged vessels, which has significant impact on the transport and installation of wind turbine generators for offshore wind farm developments in the U.S. This study identifies two main methods for transport and installation of wind turbine generators:  \n\nU.S. flagged Wind Turbine Installation Vessel   \n\nForeign flagged Wind Turbine Installation Vessel with feeder barges  \n\nThe thesis is based on a qualitative method using semi structured interviews with four key strategic stakeholders from the industry. This research is organized by using the Gioia method and supported by established guidelines about how to do qualitative research and case studies. \n\nThe thesis concludes that neither of the strategies are clearly better than the other across all aspects. The strategic decisions must consider specific project needs, stakeholder priorities, and the regulatory landscape. However, based on the favorable operational workability, this thesis outlines the U.S. flagged installation vessel as the best solution in the long-term perspective, despite the higher upfront capital investment. On the other hand, the foreign-flagged WTIVs with feeder barges present a lower upfront investment but may lead to increased operational complexities and challenges",

      "abstract": "Deciding when and how to maintain offshore wind turbines is becoming even more complex as the size of wind farms increases, while accessibility is challenging compared to onshore wind farms. Planning future maintenance actions requires the wind farm operator to consider factors such as the current condition of the turbine, the cost of a given maintenance action, revenue generated by the asset, weather factors and vessel availability. Rather than making case-by-case decisions for each turbine, the approach described in this paper allows the wind farm operators to automate the process of short to-medium term maintenance planning through application of a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP). The model proposed here is capable of suggesting the cost-optimal maintenance policy given weather forecast, future vessel costs and availability and the current condition of the turbine. Using the semi-Markov approach, allows the user to implement time varying failure rate. As the model is capable of utilising time-series data, future weather and vessel constraints can be applied depending on the information available to the user at the time, which will be reflected in the optimal policy suggested by the model. The model proposed here facilitates maintenance decision making in wind farms and will lead to cost reduction through more efficient planning. In addition to that, the model can be used to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of using vessels with different properties",

The aim of this paper is to investigate if the floating foundation technology offers new\r\napproaches for the way offshore wind power plants are operated and maintained. The possibility to return the semisubmersible\r\nwind turbine to shore, allows that maintenance activities could be carried out near to shore (for\r\nexample in a dry dock) with fewer restrictions and lower cost. The point of interest therefore is, to what extent it\r\nis technical and economical feasible to perform \u201coffshore\u201d maintenance in comparison with \u201conshore\u201d\r\nmaintenance for which the floating platform needs to be repositioned. This was studied by comparing the cost for\r\neach O&M strategy. Weather restrictions, distance to shore and the technology readiness level influence both\r\nconcepts. In general, it can be concluded that with the current technology level, returning a semi-submersible\r\nfloating wind turbine for scheduled maintenance campaigns on a regular basis is not an economical and technical\r\nfeasible approach. Keeping in mind, that the floating wind turbine technology is still in the prototype and precommercial\r\nphase, this also concludes that there is still large potential for improvement",

      "title": "Maintenance optimisation for wind turbines.",
      "abstract": "Wind is becoming an increasingly important source of energy for countries that ratify to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and mitigate the effects of global warming. Investments in wind farms are affected by inter-related assets and stakeholders requirements. These requirements demand a well-founded Asset Management (AM) frame-work which is currently lacking in the wind industry. Drawing from processes, tools and techniques of AM in other industries, a structured model for AM in the wind industry is developed. The model divulges that maintenance is indispensable to the core business objectives of the wind industry. However, the common maintenance strategies applied to wind turbines are inadequate to support the current commercial drivers of the wind industry. Consequently, a hybrid approach to the selection of a suitable maintenance strategy is developed. The approach is used in a case study to demonstrate its practical application. Suitable Condition-Based Maintenance activities for wind turbines are determined. Maintenance optimisation is a means to determine the most cost-effective maintenance strategy. Field failure and maintenance data of wind turbines are collected and analysed using two quantitative maintenance optimisation techniques; Modelling System Failures (MSF) and Delay-Time Maintenance Model (DTMM). The MSF permits the evaluation of life-data samples and enables the design and simulation of a systems model to determine optimum maintenance activities. Maximum Likelihood Estimation is used to estimate the shape (\u00ce\u00b2) and scale (\u00ce\u00b7) parameters of the Weibull distribution for critical components and subsystems of the wind turbines. Reliability Block Diagrams are designed using the estimated \u00ce\u00b2 and \u00ce\u00b7 to model the failures of the wind turbines and of a selected wind farm. The models are simulated to assess and optimise the reliability, availability and maintainability of the wind turbine and the farm. The DTMM examines equipment failure patterns by taking into account failure consequences, inspection time and cost in order to determine optimum inspection intervals. Defects rate (\u00ce\u00b1) and mean delay-time (1/\u00ce\u00b3) of components and subsystems within the wind turbine are estimated. Optimal inspection intervals for critical subsystems of the wind turbine are then determined",

This paper presents an overview of the maritime logistics planning problem for a predictive maintenance regime and introduces the current state-of-the-art for operational research in the field of operation and maintenance at offshore wind farms. Findings are that a combination of the vessel resource scheduling problem for operation and maintenance at offshore wind farms with predictive analysis and digital twins is a promising future research step.

      "title": "Modelling analysis of maintenance logistics optimization for a floating wind park: A case study for Utsira Nord",
      "abstract": "The global society is part of a climate challenge that requires the development of will, understanding and technology. The United Nations has given the climate challenge its sustainability goal, saying, \"Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\" [1]. There will not be sufficiently developed energy production today in the context of future electrification of the Norwegian everyday life and industry. Norway needs to invest in more green energy production not to become an import nation of energy, but; an export nation. On June 12th, 2020, the Utsira Nord area was opened by the Government by royal decree for energy production from floating offshore wind [2]. \n\nBy taking a closer look at the well-known concept of Operating expenditures, one can see clear advantages and challenges related to floating offshore wind [3]. It shows how important it is to optimise the maintenance strategy for the industry, and this is the basis for this thesis. There are many logistics solutions, and many factors influencing the choice that is hard to know beforehand. Therefore, it will depend on each wind farm to decide the best alternative to provide maintenance services. Hence, this thesis aims to investigate the following questions:\n\u2022\tHow to utilize modelling and simulation method for selection of optimal maintenance logistics strategy for a wind farm at Utsira Nord\n\u2022\tWhat will be an optimal maintenance logistics strategy for an imaginary Utsira Nord wind farm, seen from cost-benefit perspective and emission perspective\n\nA case study has been carried out based on an imaginary wind farm at Utsira Nord to answer the research questions. Shoreline software is used to create simulations, and analyses potential technical solutions. The research is executed in the following steps: (1) extract stakeholder requirements and acceptance criteria and define the purpose of the simulation model, (2) systems analysis of the wind park, maintenance program and logistic vessels, (3) collect and extract failure and maintenance data from existing offshore wind parks, (4) collect technical and economic data for several logistic maintenance vessels, (5) design and prepare the simulation cases, (6) perform the simulation cases and visualise the results, (7) verification and validation, including sensitivity analysis and (8) evaluate and select the most optimal logistic vessel alternative based on cost/availability and emissions\n\n\nWhen it comes to the most optimal vessel for the case wind park, the result clearly shows that the service operation vessel provides more benefits in terms of overall grading for cost/availability and emissions. It comes out far better than the crew transfer vessel because of the sensitivity associated with the maximum wave height for this vessel. This causes a significantly higher downtime for the wind farm, and the analysis shows that the case can increase its turnover by \u20ac 13,844,000 by using a service operation vessel in favour of a crew transfer vessel concerning lost production.\n\nThe method used to carry out the analysis and simulation can be used as a starting point to provide the most optimal maintenance logistics strategy for each park. It can be common service operation vessel for several parks within the same field, several crew transfer vessels or make use of other logistical possibilities such as helicopters",

The deployment of renewable generation is essential to mitigate climate change as it offers a sustainable and clean alternative energy. Following the success of bottom fixed wind, developers are looking to deeper waters to expand current development. This thesis delves into the complexities and challenges associated with the operation and maintenance of floating offshore wind farms. The research explores the unique hurdles presented by harnessing wind energy in deeper waters, such as increased distance to shore and uncharted areas. Floating wind sites also introduce specific operational challenges due to the\nmotion of the turbine which has a significant impact on the way in which offshore sites are both operated and maintained. This work consists of three distinct parts: identifying challenges, quantifying their impact, and proposing potential mitigating strategies. Through analysis and modelling of operational expenditure, the study identifies key challenges faced during the maintenance of floating wind farms, with a focus on technology-specific issues arising from turbine motion. Based on a review of current technology, future markets of deployment, and current operational challenges: location, scale, design convergence and turbine motion are identified as the key areas which are set to have a significant impact on the operation of future floating offshore sites.

      "title": "Maintenance optimisation for wind turbines.",
      "abstract": "Wind is becoming an increasingly important source of energy for countries that ratify to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and mitigate the effects of global warming. Investments in wind farms are affected by inter-related assets and stakeholders requirements. These requirements demand a well-founded Asset Management (AM) frame-work which is currently lacking in the wind industry. Drawing from processes, tools and techniques of AM in other industries, a structured model for AM in the wind industry is developed. The model divulges that maintenance is indispensable to the core business objectives of the wind industry. However, the common maintenance strategies applied to wind turbines are inadequate to support the current commercial drivers of the wind industry. Consequently, a hybrid approach to the selection of a suitable maintenance strategy is developed. The approach is used in a case study to demonstrate its practical application. Suitable Condition-Based Maintenance activities for wind turbines are determined. Maintenance optimisation is a means to determine the most cost-effective maintenance strategy. Field failure and maintenance data of wind turbines are collected and analysed using two quantitative maintenance optimisation techniques; Modelling System Failures (MSF) and Delay-Time Maintenance Model (DTMM). The MSF permits the evaluation of life-data samples and enables the design and simulation of a systems model to determine optimum maintenance activities. Maximum Likelihood Estimation is used to estimate the shape (\u00ce\u00b2) and scale (\u00ce\u00b7) parameters of the Weibull distribution for critical components and subsystems of the wind turbines. Reliability Block Diagrams are designed using the estimated \u00ce\u00b2 and \u00ce\u00b7 to model the failures of the wind turbines and of a selected wind farm. The models are simulated to assess and optimise the reliability, availability and maintainability of the wind turbine and the farm. The DTMM examines equipment failure patterns by taking into account failure consequences, inspection time and cost in order to determine optimum inspection intervals. Defects rate (\u00ce\u00b1) and mean delay-time (1/\u00ce\u00b3) of components and subsystems within the wind turbine are estimated. Optimal inspection intervals for critical subsystems of the wind turbine are then determined",

      "title": "Modelling analysis of maintenance logistics optimization for a floating wind park: A case study for Utsira Nord",
      "abstract": "The global society is part of a climate challenge that requires the development of will, understanding and technology. The United Nations has given the climate challenge its sustainability goal, saying, \"Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\" [1]. There will not be sufficiently developed energy production today in the context of future electrification of the Norwegian everyday life and industry. Norway needs to invest in more green energy production not to become an import nation of energy, but; an export nation. On June 12th, 2020, the Utsira Nord area was opened by the Government by royal decree for energy production from floating offshore wind [2]. \n\nBy taking a closer look at the well-known concept of Operating expenditures, one can see clear advantages and challenges related to floating offshore wind [3]. It shows how important it is to optimise the maintenance strategy for the industry, and this is the basis for this thesis. There are many logistics solutions, and many factors influencing the choice that is hard to know beforehand. Therefore, it will depend on each wind farm to decide the best alternative to provide maintenance services. Hence, this thesis aims to investigate the following questions:\n\u2022\tHow to utilize modelling and simulation method for selection of optimal maintenance logistics strategy for a wind farm at Utsira Nord\n\u2022\tWhat will be an optimal maintenance logistics strategy for an imaginary Utsira Nord wind farm, seen from cost-benefit perspective and emission perspective\n\nA case study has been carried out based on an imaginary wind farm at Utsira Nord to answer the research questions. Shoreline software is used to create simulations, and analyses potential technical solutions. The research is executed in the following steps: (1) extract stakeholder requirements and acceptance criteria and define the purpose of the simulation model, (2) systems analysis of the wind park, maintenance program and logistic vessels, (3) collect and extract failure and maintenance data from existing offshore wind parks, (4) collect technical and economic data for several logistic maintenance vessels, (5) design and prepare the simulation cases, (6) perform the simulation cases and visualise the results, (7) verification and validation, including sensitivity analysis and (8) evaluate and select the most optimal logistic vessel alternative based on cost/availability and emissions\n\n\nWhen it comes to the most optimal vessel for the case wind park, the result clearly shows that the service operation vessel provides more benefits in terms of overall grading for cost/availability and emissions. It comes out far better than the crew transfer vessel because of the sensitivity associated with the maximum wave height for this vessel. This causes a significantly higher downtime for the wind farm, and the analysis shows that the case can increase its turnover by \u20ac 13,844,000 by using a service operation vessel in favour of a crew transfer vessel concerning lost production.\n\nThe method used to carry out the analysis and simulation can be used as a starting point to provide the most optimal maintenance logistics strategy for each park. It can be common service operation vessel for several parks within the same field, several crew transfer vessels or make use of other logistical possibilities such as helicopters",

      "abstract": "This thesis explores the regulatory and strategic impacts of the Jones Act on the transport and installation of wind turbine generators in the U.S. offshore wind industry. The research specifically addresses two primary questions:  \n\u2022How does the Jones Act impact the transport and installation of wind turbine generators in the U.S. offshore wind industry? \n\u2022What is the best overall solution to comply with Jones Act, for transport and installation of wind turbine generators in the U.S.?  \nThe U.S. has significant ambitions to expand its offshore wind capacity, with a federal target to deploy 30 gigawatts by 2030. The Jones Act, a century-old maritime law, presents both challenges and opportunities in this context. It requires that transportation between U.S. ports is performed by U.S. flagged vessels, which has significant impact on the transport and installation of wind turbine generators for offshore wind farm developments in the U.S. This study identifies two main methods for transport and installation of wind turbine generators: \n\u2022U.S. flagged Wind Turbine Installation Vessel  \n\u2022Foreign flagged Wind Turbine Installation Vessel with feeder barges \nThe thesis is based on a qualitative method using semi structured interviews with four key strategic stakeholders from the industry. This research is organized by using the Gioia method and supported by established guidelines about how to do qualitative research and case studies.\nThe thesis concludes that neither of the strategies are clearly better than the other across all aspects. The strategic decisions must consider specific project needs, stakeholder priorities, and the regulatory landscape. However, based on the favorable operational workability, this thesis outlines the U.S. flagged installation vessel as the best solution in the long-term perspective, despite the higher upfront capital investment. On the other hand, the foreign-flagged WTIVs with feeder barges present a lower upfront investment but may lead to increased operational complexities and challenges",

      "title": "Time series semi-Markov decision process with variable costs for maintenance planning",
      "abstract": "Deciding when and how to maintain offshore wind turbines is becoming even more complex as the size of wind farms increases, while accessibility is challenging compared to onshore wind farms. Planning future maintenance actions requires the wind farm operator to consider factors such as the current condition of the turbine, the cost of a given maintenance action, revenue generated by the asset, weather factors and vessel availability. Rather than making case-by-case decisions for each turbine, the approach described in this paper allows the wind farm operators to automate the process of short to-medium term maintenance planning through application of a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP). The model proposed here is capable of suggesting the cost-optimal maintenance policy given weather forecast, future vessel costs and availability and the current condition of the turbine. Using the semi-Markov approach, allows the user to implement time varying failure rate. As the model is capable of utilising time-series data, future weather and vessel constraints can be applied depending on the information available to the user at the time, which will be reflected in the optimal policy suggested by the model. The model proposed here facilitates maintenance decision making in wind farms and will lead to cost reduction through more efficient planning. In addition to that, the model can be used to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of using vessels with different properties",

The MSF permits the evaluation of life-data samples and enables the design and simulation of a systems model to determine optimum maintenance activities. Maximum Likelihood Estimation is used to estimate the shape (\u00ce\u00b2) and scale (\u00ce\u00b7) parameters of the Weibull distribution for critical components and subsystems of the wind turbines. Reliability Block Diagrams are designed using the estimated \u00ce\u00b2 and \u00ce\u00b7 to model the failures of the wind turbines and of a selected wind farm. The models are simulated to assess and optimise the reliability, availability and maintainability of the wind turbine and the farm. The DTMM examines equipment failure patterns by taking into account failure consequences, inspection time and cost in order to determine optimum inspection intervals. Defects rate (\u00ce\u00b1) and mean delay-time (1/\u00ce\u00b3) of components and subsystems within the wind turbine are estimated. Optimal inspection intervals for critical subsystems of the wind turbine are then determined",

      "title": "Modelling analysis of maintenance logistics optimization for a floating wind park: A case study for Utsira Nord",
      "abstract": "The global society is part of a climate challenge that requires the development of will, understanding and technology. The United Nations has given the climate challenge its sustainability goal, saying, \"Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\" [1]. There will not be sufficiently developed energy production today in the context of future electrification of the Norwegian everyday life and industry. Norway needs to invest in more green energy production not to become an import nation of energy, but; an export nation. On June 12th, 2020, the Utsira Nord area was opened by the Government by royal decree for energy production from floating offshore wind [2]. \n\nBy taking a closer look at the well-known concept of Operating expenditures, one can see clear advantages and challenges related to floating offshore wind [3]. It shows how important it is to optimise the maintenance strategy for the industry, and this is the basis for this thesis. There are many logistics solutions, and many factors influencing the choice that is hard to know beforehand. Therefore, it will depend on each wind farm to decide the best alternative to provide maintenance services. Hence, this thesis aims to investigate the following questions:\n\u2022\tHow to utilize modelling and simulation method for selection of optimal maintenance logistics strategy for a wind farm at Utsira Nord\n\u2022\tWhat will be an optimal maintenance logistics strategy for an imaginary Utsira Nord wind farm, seen from cost-benefit perspective and emission perspective\n\nA case study has been carried out based on an imaginary wind farm at Utsira Nord to answer the research questions. Shoreline software is used to create simulations, and analyses potential technical solutions. The research is executed in the following steps: (1) extract stakeholder requirements and acceptance criteria and define the purpose of the simulation model, (2) systems analysis of the wind park, maintenance program and logistic vessels, (3) collect and extract failure and maintenance data from existing offshore wind parks, (4) collect technical and economic data for several logistic maintenance vessels, (5) design and prepare the simulation cases, (6) perform the simulation cases and visualise the results, (7) verification and validation, including sensitivity analysis and (8) evaluate and select the most optimal logistic vessel alternative based on cost/availability and emissions\n\n\nWhen it comes to the most optimal vessel for the case wind park, the result clearly shows that the service operation vessel provides more benefits in terms of overall grading for cost/availability and emissions. It comes out far better than the crew transfer vessel because of the sensitivity associated with the maximum wave height for this vessel. This causes a significantly higher downtime for the wind farm, and the analysis shows that the case can increase its turnover by \u20ac 13,844,000 by using a service operation vessel in favour of a crew transfer vessel concerning lost production.\n\nThe method used to carry out the analysis and simulation can be used as a starting point to provide the most optimal maintenance logistics strategy for each park. It can be common service operation vessel for several parks within the same field, several crew transfer vessels or make use of other logistical possibilities such as helicopters",

      "title": "Time series semi-Markov decision process with variable costs for maintenance planning",
      "abstract": "Deciding when and how to maintain offshore wind turbines is becoming even more complex as the size of wind farms increases, while accessibility is challenging compared to onshore wind farms. Planning future maintenance actions requires the wind farm operator to consider factors such as the current condition of the turbine, the cost of a given maintenance action, revenue generated by the asset, weather factors and vessel availability. Rather than making case-by-case decisions for each turbine, the approach described in this paper allows the wind farm operators to automate the process of short to-medium term maintenance planning through application of a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP). The model proposed here is capable of suggesting the cost-optimal maintenance policy given weather forecast, future vessel costs and availability and the current condition of the turbine. Using the semi-Markov approach, allows the user to implement time varying failure rate. As the model is capable of utilising time-series data, future weather and vessel constraints can be applied depending on the information available to the user at the time, which will be reflected in the optimal policy suggested by the model. The model proposed here facilitates maintenance decision making in wind farms and will lead to cost reduction through more efficient planning. In addition to that, the model can be used to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of using vessels with different properties",

      "abstract": "Climate change is a pressing global issue caused by increasing greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels for energy generation. The deployment of renewable generation is essential to mitigate climate change as it offers a sustainable and clean alternative energy. Following the success of bottom fixed wind, developers are looking to deeper waters to expand current development. This thesis delves into the complexities and challenges associated with the operation and maintenance of floating offshore wind farms. The research explores the unique hurdles presented by harnessing wind energy in deeper waters, such as increased distance to shore and uncharted areas. Floating wind sites also introduce specific operational challenges due to the\nmotion of the turbine which has a significant impact on the way in which offshore sites are both operated and maintained. This work consists of three distinct parts: identifying challenges, quantifying their impact, and proposing potential mitigating strategies. Through analysis and modelling of operational expenditure, the study identifies key challenges faced during the maintenance of floating wind farms, with a focus on technology-specific issues arising from turbine motion. Based on a review of current technology, future markets of deployment, and current operational challenges: location, scale, design convergence and turbine motion are identified as the key areas which are set to have a significant impact on the operation of future floating offshore sites. After identifying the challenges, their impact on the operational phase of the project is quantified. Through the use of offshore wind key performance indicators, the accessibility and total operational expenditure are determined for floating wind against an equivalent bottom fixed wind site. This then has a potentially significant impact on lost revenue which increases total cost. The increase in lost revenue is a result of reduced access due to additional restrictions placed on accessible conditions during specific turbine motion.\nAdditionally, the thesis quantifies the operational impact of these challenges and explores potential maintenance strategies to reduce OPEX, including the concept of opportunistic maintenance. The study introduces the OM+ framework, which identifies market-based opportunities for maintenance, aiming to enhance cost-effectiveness and efficiency.

The aim of this paper is to investigate if the floating foundation technology offers new\r\napproaches for the way offshore wind power plants are operated and maintained. The possibility to return the semisubmersible\r\nwind turbine to shore, allows that maintenance activities could be carried out near to shore (for\r\nexample in a dry dock) with fewer restrictions and lower cost.

      "abstract": "Wind is becoming an increasingly important source of energy for countries that ratify to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and mitigate the effects of global warming. Investments in wind farms are affected by inter-related assets and stakeholders requirements. These requirements demand a well-founded Asset Management (AM) frame-work which is currently lacking in the wind industry. Drawing from processes, tools and techniques of AM in other industries, a structured model for AM in the wind industry is developed. The model divulges that maintenance is indispensable to the core business objectives of the wind industry. However, the common maintenance strategies applied to wind turbines are inadequate to support the current commercial drivers of the wind industry. Consequently, a hybrid approach to the selection of a suitable maintenance strategy is developed. The approach is used in a case study to demonstrate its practical application. Suitable Condition-Based Maintenance activities for wind turbines are determined. Maintenance optimisation is a means to determine the most cost-effective maintenance strategy. Field failure and maintenance data of wind turbines are collected and analysed using two quantitative maintenance optimisation techniques; Modelling System Failures (MSF) and Delay-Time Maintenance Model (DTMM).

      "title": "Time series semi-Markov decision process with variable costs for maintenance planning",
      "abstract": "Deciding when and how to maintain offshore wind turbines is becoming even more complex as the size of wind farms increases, while accessibility is challenging compared to onshore wind farms. Planning future maintenance actions requires the wind farm operator to consider factors such as the current condition of the turbine, the cost of a given maintenance action, revenue generated by the asset, weather factors and vessel availability. Rather than making case-by-case decisions for each turbine, the approach described in this paper allows the wind farm operators to automate the process of short to-medium term maintenance planning through application of a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP). The model proposed here is capable of suggesting the cost-optimal maintenance policy given weather forecast, future vessel costs and availability and the current condition of the turbine. Using the semi-Markov approach, allows the user to implement time varying failure rate. As the model is capable of utilising time-series data, future weather and vessel constraints can be applied depending on the information available to the user at the time, which will be reflected in the optimal policy suggested by the model. The model proposed here facilitates maintenance decision making in wind farms and will lead to cost reduction through more efficient planning. In addition to that, the model can be used to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of using vessels with different properties",

      "abstract": "Climate change is a pressing global issue caused by increasing greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels for energy generation. The deployment of renewable generation is essential to mitigate climate change as it offers a sustainable and clean alternative energy. Following the success of bottom fixed wind, developers are looking to deeper waters to expand current development. This thesis delves into the complexities and challenges associated with the operation and maintenance of floating offshore wind farms. The research explores the unique hurdles presented by harnessing wind energy in deeper waters, such as increased distance to shore and uncharted areas. Floating wind sites also introduce specific operational challenges due to the\nmotion of the turbine which has a significant impact on the way in which offshore sites are both operated and maintained. This work consists of three distinct parts: identifying challenges, quantifying their impact, and proposing potential mitigating strategies. Through analysis and modelling of operational expenditure, the study identifies key challenges faced during the maintenance of floating wind farms, with a focus on technology-specific issues arising from turbine motion. Based on a review of current technology, future markets of deployment, and current operational challenges: location, scale, design convergence and turbine motion are identified as the key areas which are set to have a significant impact on the operation of future floating offshore sites. After identifying the challenges, their impact on the operational phase of the project is quantified. Through the use of offshore wind key performance indicators, the accessibility and total operational expenditure are determined for floating wind against an equivalent bottom fixed wind site. This then has a potentially significant impact on lost revenue which increases total cost. The increase in lost revenue is a result of reduced access due to additional restrictions placed on accessible conditions during specific turbine motion.\nAdditionally, the thesis quantifies the operational impact of these challenges and explores potential maintenance strategies to reduce OPEX, including the concept of opportunistic maintenance.

The aim of this paper is to investigate if the floating foundation technology offers new\r\napproaches for the way offshore wind power plants are operated and maintained. The possibility to return the semisubmersible\r\nwind turbine to shore, allows that maintenance activities could be carried out near to shore (for\r\nexample in a dry dock) with fewer restrictions and lower cost. The point of interest therefore is, to what extent it\r\nis technical and economical feasible to perform \u201coffshore\u201d maintenance in comparison with \u201conshore\u201d\r\nmaintenance for which the floating platform needs to be repositioned. This was studied by comparing the cost for\r\neach O&M strategy. Weather restrictions, distance to shore and the technology readiness level influence both\r\nconcepts. In general, it can be concluded that with the current technology level, returning a semi-submersible\r\nfloating wind turbine for scheduled maintenance campaigns on a regular basis is not an economical and technical\r\nfeasible approach. Keeping in mind, that the floating wind turbine technology is still in the prototype and precommercial\r\nphase, this also concludes that there is still large potential for improvement",

      "title": "Maintenance optimisation for wind turbines.",
      "abstract": "Wind is becoming an increasingly important source of energy for countries that ratify to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and mitigate the effects of global warming. Investments in wind farms are affected by inter-related assets and stakeholders requirements. These requirements demand a well-founded Asset Management (AM) frame-work which is currently lacking in the wind industry. Drawing from processes, tools and techniques of AM in other industries, a structured model for AM in the wind industry is developed. The model divulges that maintenance is indispensable to the core business objectives of the wind industry. However, the common maintenance strategies applied to wind turbines are inadequate to support the current commercial drivers of the wind industry. Consequently, a hybrid approach to the selection of a suitable maintenance strategy is developed. The approach is used in a case study to demonstrate its practical application. Suitable Condition-Based Maintenance activities for wind turbines are determined. Maintenance optimisation is a means to determine the most cost-effective maintenance strategy. Field failure and maintenance data of wind turbines are collected and analysed using two quantitative maintenance optimisation techniques; Modelling System Failures (MSF) and Delay-Time Maintenance Model (DTMM). The MSF permits the evaluation of life-data samples and enables the design and simulation of a systems model to determine optimum maintenance activities. Maximum Likelihood Estimation is used to estimate the shape (\u00ce\u00b2) and scale (\u00ce\u00b7) parameters of the Weibull distribution for critical components and subsystems of the wind turbines. Reliability Block Diagrams are designed using the estimated \u00ce\u00b2 and \u00ce\u00b7 to model the failures of the wind turbines and of a selected wind farm. The models are simulated to assess and optimise the reliability, availability and maintainability of the wind turbine and the farm. The DTMM examines equipment failure patterns by taking into account failure consequences, inspection time and cost in order to determine optimum inspection intervals. Defects rate (\u00ce\u00b1) and mean delay-time (1/\u00ce\u00b3) of components and subsystems within the wind turbine are estimated. Optimal inspection intervals for critical subsystems of the wind turbine are then determined",

Findings are that a combination of the vessel resource scheduling problem for operation and maintenance at offshore wind farms with predictive analysis and digital twins is a promising future research step.

      "abstract": "The global society is part of a climate challenge that requires the development of will, understanding and technology. The United Nations has given the climate challenge its sustainability goal, saying, \"Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\" [1]. There will not be sufficiently developed energy production today in the context of future electrification of the Norwegian everyday life and industry. Norway needs to invest in more green energy production not to become an import nation of energy, but; an export nation. On June 12th, 2020, the Utsira Nord area was opened by the Government by royal decree for energy production from floating offshore wind [2]. \n\nBy taking a closer look at the well-known concept of Operating expenditures, one can see clear advantages and challenges related to floating offshore wind [3]. It shows how important it is to optimise the maintenance strategy for the industry, and this is the basis for this thesis. There are many logistics solutions, and many factors influencing the choice that is hard to know beforehand. Therefore, it will depend on each wind farm to decide the best alternative to provide maintenance services. Hence, this thesis aims to investigate the following questions:\n\u2022\tHow to utilize modelling and simulation method for selection of optimal maintenance logistics strategy for a wind farm at Utsira Nord\n\u2022\tWhat will be an optimal maintenance logistics strategy for an imaginary Utsira Nord wind farm, seen from cost-benefit perspective and emission perspective\n\nA case study has been carried out based on an imaginary wind farm at Utsira Nord to answer the research questions. Shoreline software is used to create simulations, and analyses potential technical solutions. The research is executed in the following steps: (1) extract stakeholder requirements and acceptance criteria and define the purpose of the simulation model, (2) systems analysis of the wind park, maintenance program and logistic vessels, (3) collect and extract failure and maintenance data from existing offshore wind parks, (4) collect technical and economic data for several logistic maintenance vessels, (5) design and prepare the simulation cases, (6) perform the simulation cases and visualise the results, (7) verification and validation, including sensitivity analysis and (8) evaluate and select the most optimal logistic vessel alternative based on cost/availability and emissions\n\n\nWhen it comes to the most optimal vessel for the case wind park, the result clearly shows that the service operation vessel provides more benefits in terms of overall grading for cost/availability and emissions.

This research is organized by using the Gioia method and supported by established guidelines about how to do qualitative research and case studies. \n\nThe thesis concludes that neither of the strategies are clearly better than the other across all aspects. The strategic decisions must consider specific project needs, stakeholder priorities, and the regulatory landscape. However, based on the favorable operational workability, this thesis outlines the U.S. flagged installation vessel as the best solution in the long-term perspective, despite the higher upfront capital investment. On the other hand, the foreign-flagged WTIVs with feeder barges present a lower upfront investment but may lead to increased operational complexities and challenges",

      "abstract": "Deciding when and how to maintain offshore wind turbines is becoming even more complex as the size of wind farms increases, while accessibility is challenging compared to onshore wind farms. Planning future maintenance actions requires the wind farm operator to consider factors such as the current condition of the turbine, the cost of a given maintenance action, revenue generated by the asset, weather factors and vessel availability. Rather than making case-by-case decisions for each turbine, the approach described in this paper allows the wind farm operators to automate the process of short to-medium term maintenance planning through application of a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP). The model proposed here is capable of suggesting the cost-optimal maintenance policy given weather forecast, future vessel costs and availability and the current condition of the turbine. Using the semi-Markov approach, allows the user to implement time varying failure rate. As the model is capable of utilising time-series data, future weather and vessel constraints can be applied depending on the information available to the user at the time, which will be reflected in the optimal policy suggested by the model. The model proposed here facilitates maintenance decision making in wind farms and will lead to cost reduction through more efficient planning. In addition to that, the model can be used to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of using vessels with different properties",

The aim of this paper is to investigate if the floating foundation technology offers new\r\napproaches for the way offshore wind power plants are operated and maintained. The possibility to return the semisubmersible\r\nwind turbine to shore, allows that maintenance activities could be carried out near to shore (for\r\nexample in a dry dock) with fewer restrictions and lower cost. The point of interest therefore is, to what extent it\r\nis technical and economical feasible to perform \u201coffshore\u201d maintenance in comparison with \u201conshore\u201d\r\nmaintenance for which the floating platform needs to be repositioned. This was studied by comparing the cost for\r\neach O&M strategy. Weather restrictions, distance to shore and the technology readiness level influence both\r\nconcepts. In general, it can be concluded that with the current technology level, returning a semi-submersible\r\nfloating wind turbine for scheduled maintenance campaigns on a regular basis is not an economical and technical\r\nfeasible approach. Keeping in mind, that the floating wind turbine technology is still in the prototype and precommercial\r\nphase, this also concludes that there is still large potential for improvement",

      "title": "Maintenance optimisation for wind turbines.",
      "abstract": "Wind is becoming an increasingly important source of energy for countries that ratify to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and mitigate the effects of global warming. Investments in wind farms are affected by inter-related assets and stakeholders requirements. These requirements demand a well-founded Asset Management (AM) frame-work which is currently lacking in the wind industry. Drawing from processes, tools and techniques of AM in other industries, a structured model for AM in the wind industry is developed. The model divulges that maintenance is indispensable to the core business objectives of the wind industry. However, the common maintenance strategies applied to wind turbines are inadequate to support the current commercial drivers of the wind industry. Consequently, a hybrid approach to the selection of a suitable maintenance strategy is developed. The approach is used in a case study to demonstrate its practical application. Suitable Condition-Based Maintenance activities for wind turbines are determined. Maintenance optimisation is a means to determine the most cost-effective maintenance strategy. Field failure and maintenance data of wind turbines are collected and analysed using two quantitative maintenance optimisation techniques; Modelling System Failures (MSF) and Delay-Time Maintenance Model (DTMM). The MSF permits the evaluation of life-data samples and enables the design and simulation of a systems model to determine optimum maintenance activities. Maximum Likelihood Estimation is used to estimate the shape (\u00ce\u00b2) and scale (\u00ce\u00b7) parameters of the Weibull distribution for critical components and subsystems of the wind turbines. Reliability Block Diagrams are designed using the estimated \u00ce\u00b2 and \u00ce\u00b7 to model the failures of the wind turbines and of a selected wind farm. The models are simulated to assess and optimise the reliability, availability and maintainability of the wind turbine and the farm. The DTMM examines equipment failure patterns by taking into account failure consequences, inspection time and cost in order to determine optimum inspection intervals. Defects rate (\u00ce\u00b1) and mean delay-time (1/\u00ce\u00b3) of components and subsystems within the wind turbine are estimated. Optimal inspection intervals for critical subsystems of the wind turbine are then determined",

This paper presents an overview of the maritime logistics planning problem for a predictive maintenance regime and introduces the current state-of-the-art for operational research in the field of operation and maintenance at offshore wind farms. Findings are that a combination of the vessel resource scheduling problem for operation and maintenance at offshore wind farms with predictive analysis and digital twins is a promising future research step.

      "title": "Modelling analysis of maintenance logistics optimization for a floating wind park: A case study for Utsira Nord",
      "abstract": "The global society is part of a climate challenge that requires the development of will, understanding and technology. The United Nations has given the climate challenge its sustainability goal, saying, \"Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\" [1]. There will not be sufficiently developed energy production today in the context of future electrification of the Norwegian everyday life and industry. Norway needs to invest in more green energy production not to become an import nation of energy, but; an export nation. On June 12th, 2020, the Utsira Nord area was opened by the Government by royal decree for energy production from floating offshore wind [2]. \n\nBy taking a closer look at the well-known concept of Operating expenditures, one can see clear advantages and challenges related to floating offshore wind [3]. It shows how important it is to optimise the maintenance strategy for the industry, and this is the basis for this thesis. There are many logistics solutions, and many factors influencing the choice that is hard to know beforehand. Therefore, it will depend on each wind farm to decide the best alternative to provide maintenance services. Hence, this thesis aims to investigate the following questions:\n\u2022\tHow to utilize modelling and simulation method for selection of optimal maintenance logistics strategy for a wind farm at Utsira Nord\n\u2022\tWhat will be an optimal maintenance logistics strategy for an imaginary Utsira Nord wind farm, seen from cost-benefit perspective and emission perspective\n\nA case study has been carried out based on an imaginary wind farm at Utsira Nord to answer the research questions. Shoreline software is used to create simulations, and analyses potential technical solutions. The research is executed in the following steps: (1) extract stakeholder requirements and acceptance criteria and define the purpose of the simulation model, (2) systems analysis of the wind park, maintenance program and logistic vessels, (3) collect and extract failure and maintenance data from existing offshore wind parks, (4) collect technical and economic data for several logistic maintenance vessels, (5) design and prepare the simulation cases, (6) perform the simulation cases and visualise the results, (7) verification and validation, including sensitivity analysis and (8) evaluate and select the most optimal logistic vessel alternative based on cost/availability and emissions\n\n\nWhen it comes to the most optimal vessel for the case wind park, the result clearly shows that the service operation vessel provides more benefits in terms of overall grading for cost/availability and emissions. It comes out far better than the crew transfer vessel because of the sensitivity associated with the maximum wave height for this vessel. This causes a significantly higher downtime for the wind farm, and the analysis shows that the case can increase its turnover by \u20ac 13,844,000 by using a service operation vessel in favour of a crew transfer vessel concerning lost production.\n\nThe method used to carry out the analysis and simulation can be used as a starting point to provide the most optimal maintenance logistics strategy for each park. It can be common service operation vessel for several parks within the same field, several crew transfer vessels or make use of other logistical possibilities such as helicopters",

The deployment of renewable generation is essential to mitigate climate change as it offers a sustainable and clean alternative energy. Following the success of bottom fixed wind, developers are looking to deeper waters to expand current development. This thesis delves into the complexities and challenges associated with the operation and maintenance of floating offshore wind farms. The research explores the unique hurdles presented by harnessing wind energy in deeper waters, such as increased distance to shore and uncharted areas. Floating wind sites also introduce specific operational challenges due to the\nmotion of the turbine which has a significant impact on the way in which offshore sites are both operated and maintained. This work consists of three distinct parts: identifying challenges, quantifying their impact, and proposing potential mitigating strategies. Through analysis and modelling of operational expenditure, the study identifies key challenges faced during the maintenance of floating wind farms, with a focus on technology-specific issues arising from turbine motion. Based on a review of current technology, future markets of deployment, and current operational challenges: location, scale, design convergence and turbine motion are identified as the key areas which are set to have a significant impact on the operation of future floating offshore sites. After identifying the challenges, their impact on the operational phase of the project is quantified. Through the use of offshore wind key performance indicators, the accessibility and total operational expenditure are determined for floating wind against an equivalent bottom fixed wind site. This then has a potentially significant impact on lost revenue which increases total cost. The increase in lost revenue is a result of reduced access due to additional restrictions placed on accessible conditions during specific turbine motion.\nAdditionally, the thesis quantifies the operational impact of these challenges and explores potential maintenance strategies to reduce OPEX, including the concept of opportunistic maintenance. The study introduces the OM+ framework, which identifies market-based opportunities for maintenance, aiming to enhance cost-effectiveness and efficiency. The thesis concludes with a comprehensive summary of the research findings and recommendations for future work, contributing to a sustainable and reliable renewable energy solution for the global energy landscape",

      "title": "Maintenance optimisation for wind turbines.",
      "abstract": "Wind is becoming an increasingly important source of energy for countries that ratify to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and mitigate the effects of global warming. Investments in wind farms are affected by inter-related assets and stakeholders requirements. These requirements demand a well-founded Asset Management (AM) frame-work which is currently lacking in the wind industry. Drawing from processes, tools and techniques of AM in other industries, a structured model for AM in the wind industry is developed. The model divulges that maintenance is indispensable to the core business objectives of the wind industry. However, the common maintenance strategies applied to wind turbines are inadequate to support the current commercial drivers of the wind industry. Consequently, a hybrid approach to the selection of a suitable maintenance strategy is developed. The approach is used in a case study to demonstrate its practical application. Suitable Condition-Based Maintenance activities for wind turbines are determined. Maintenance optimisation is a means to determine the most cost-effective maintenance strategy. Field failure and maintenance data of wind turbines are collected and analysed using two quantitative maintenance optimisation techniques; Modelling System Failures (MSF) and Delay-Time Maintenance Model (DTMM). The MSF permits the evaluation of life-data samples and enables the design and simulation of a systems model to determine optimum maintenance activities. Maximum Likelihood Estimation is used to estimate the shape (\u00ce\u00b2) and scale (\u00ce\u00b7) parameters of the Weibull distribution for critical components and subsystems of the wind turbines. Reliability Block Diagrams are designed using the estimated \u00ce\u00b2 and \u00ce\u00b7 to model the failures of the wind turbines and of a selected wind farm. The models are simulated to assess and optimise the reliability, availability and maintainability of the wind turbine and the farm. The DTMM examines equipment failure patterns by taking into account failure consequences, inspection time and cost in order to determine optimum inspection intervals. Defects rate (\u00ce\u00b1) and mean delay-time (1/\u00ce\u00b3) of components and subsystems within the wind turbine are estimated. Optimal inspection intervals for critical subsystems of the wind turbine are then determined",

      "title": "Modelling analysis of maintenance logistics optimization for a floating wind park: A case study for Utsira Nord",
      "abstract": "The global society is part of a climate challenge that requires the development of will, understanding and technology. The United Nations has given the climate challenge its sustainability goal, saying, \"Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\" [1]. There will not be sufficiently developed energy production today in the context of future electrification of the Norwegian everyday life and industry. Norway needs to invest in more green energy production not to become an import nation of energy, but; an export nation. On June 12th, 2020, the Utsira Nord area was opened by the Government by royal decree for energy production from floating offshore wind [2]. \n\nBy taking a closer look at the well-known concept of Operating expenditures, one can see clear advantages and challenges related to floating offshore wind [3]. It shows how important it is to optimise the maintenance strategy for the industry, and this is the basis for this thesis. There are many logistics solutions, and many factors influencing the choice that is hard to know beforehand. Therefore, it will depend on each wind farm to decide the best alternative to provide maintenance services. Hence, this thesis aims to investigate the following questions:\n\u2022\tHow to utilize modelling and simulation method for selection of optimal maintenance logistics strategy for a wind farm at Utsira Nord\n\u2022\tWhat will be an optimal maintenance logistics strategy for an imaginary Utsira Nord wind farm, seen from cost-benefit perspective and emission perspective\n\nA case study has been carried out based on an imaginary wind farm at Utsira Nord to answer the research questions. Shoreline software is used to create simulations, and analyses potential technical solutions. The research is executed in the following steps: (1) extract stakeholder requirements and acceptance criteria and define the purpose of the simulation model, (2) systems analysis of the wind park, maintenance program and logistic vessels, (3) collect and extract failure and maintenance data from existing offshore wind parks, (4) collect technical and economic data for several logistic maintenance vessels, (5) design and prepare the simulation cases, (6) perform the simulation cases and visualise the results, (7) verification and validation, including sensitivity analysis and (8) evaluate and select the most optimal logistic vessel alternative based on cost/availability and emissions\n\n\nWhen it comes to the most optimal vessel for the case wind park, the result clearly shows that the service operation vessel provides more benefits in terms of overall grading for cost/availability and emissions. It comes out far better than the crew transfer vessel because of the sensitivity associated with the maximum wave height for this vessel. This causes a significantly higher downtime for the wind farm, and the analysis shows that the case can increase its turnover by \u20ac 13,844,000 by using a service operation vessel in favour of a crew transfer vessel concerning lost production.\n\nThe method used to carry out the analysis and simulation can be used as a starting point to provide the most optimal maintenance logistics strategy for each park. It can be common service operation vessel for several parks within the same field, several crew transfer vessels or make use of other logistical possibilities such as helicopters",

      "abstract": "This thesis explores the regulatory and strategic impacts of the Jones Act on the transport and installation of wind turbine generators in the U.S. offshore wind industry. The research specifically addresses two primary questions:  \n\u2022How does the Jones Act impact the transport and installation of wind turbine generators in the U.S. offshore wind industry? \n\u2022What is the best overall solution to comply with Jones Act, for transport and installation of wind turbine generators in the U.S.?  \nThe U.S. has significant ambitions to expand its offshore wind capacity, with a federal target to deploy 30 gigawatts by 2030. The Jones Act, a century-old maritime law, presents both challenges and opportunities in this context. It requires that transportation between U.S. ports is performed by U.S. flagged vessels, which has significant impact on the transport and installation of wind turbine generators for offshore wind farm developments in the U.S. This study identifies two main methods for transport and installation of wind turbine generators: \n\u2022U.S. flagged Wind Turbine Installation Vessel  \n\u2022Foreign flagged Wind Turbine Installation Vessel with feeder barges \nThe thesis is based on a qualitative method using semi structured interviews with four key strategic stakeholders from the industry. This research is organized by using the Gioia method and supported by established guidelines about how to do qualitative research and case studies.\nThe thesis concludes that neither of the strategies are clearly better than the other across all aspects. The strategic decisions must consider specific project needs, stakeholder priorities, and the regulatory landscape. However, based on the favorable operational workability, this thesis outlines the U.S. flagged installation vessel as the best solution in the long-term perspective, despite the higher upfront capital investment. On the other hand, the foreign-flagged WTIVs with feeder barges present a lower upfront investment but may lead to increased operational complexities and challenges",

      "title": "Time series semi-Markov decision process with variable costs for maintenance planning",
      "abstract": "Deciding when and how to maintain offshore wind turbines is becoming even more complex as the size of wind farms increases, while accessibility is challenging compared to onshore wind farms. Planning future maintenance actions requires the wind farm operator to consider factors such as the current condition of the turbine, the cost of a given maintenance action, revenue generated by the asset, weather factors and vessel availability. Rather than making case-by-case decisions for each turbine, the approach described in this paper allows the wind farm operators to automate the process of short to-medium term maintenance planning through application of a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP). The model proposed here is capable of suggesting the cost-optimal maintenance policy given weather forecast, future vessel costs and availability and the current condition of the turbine. Using the semi-Markov approach, allows the user to implement time varying failure rate. As the model is capable of utilising time-series data, future weather and vessel constraints can be applied depending on the information available to the user at the time, which will be reflected in the optimal policy suggested by the model. The model proposed here facilitates maintenance decision making in wind farms and will lead to cost reduction through more efficient planning. In addition to that, the model can be used to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of using vessels with different properties",

The models are simulated to assess and optimise the reliability, availability and maintainability of the wind turbine and the farm. The DTMM examines equipment failure patterns by taking into account failure consequences, inspection time and cost in order to determine optimum inspection intervals. Defects rate (\u00ce\u00b1) and mean delay-time (1/\u00ce\u00b3) of components and subsystems within the wind turbine are estimated. Optimal inspection intervals for critical subsystems of the wind turbine are then determined",

      "abstract": "The global society is part of a climate challenge that requires the development of will, understanding and technology. The United Nations has given the climate challenge its sustainability goal, saying, \"Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\" [1]. There will not be sufficiently developed energy production today in the context of future electrification of the Norwegian everyday life and industry. Norway needs to invest in more green energy production not to become an import nation of energy, but; an export nation. On June 12th, 2020, the Utsira Nord area was opened by the Government by royal decree for energy production from floating offshore wind [2]. \n\nBy taking a closer look at the well-known concept of Operating expenditures, one can see clear advantages and challenges related to floating offshore wind [3]. It shows how important it is to optimise the maintenance strategy for the industry, and this is the basis for this thesis. There are many logistics solutions, and many factors influencing the choice that is hard to know beforehand. Therefore, it will depend on each wind farm to decide the best alternative to provide maintenance services. Hence, this thesis aims to investigate the following questions:\n\u2022\tHow to utilize modelling and simulation method for selection of optimal maintenance logistics strategy for a wind farm at Utsira Nord\n\u2022\tWhat will be an optimal maintenance logistics strategy for an imaginary Utsira Nord wind farm, seen from cost-benefit perspective and emission perspective\n\nA case study has been carried out based on an imaginary wind farm at Utsira Nord to answer the research questions. Shoreline software is used to create simulations, and analyses potential technical solutions. The research is executed in the following steps: (1) extract stakeholder requirements and acceptance criteria and define the purpose of the simulation model, (2) systems analysis of the wind park, maintenance program and logistic vessels, (3) collect and extract failure and maintenance data from existing offshore wind parks, (4) collect technical and economic data for several logistic maintenance vessels, (5) design and prepare the simulation cases, (6) perform the simulation cases and visualise the results, (7) verification and validation, including sensitivity analysis and (8) evaluate and select the most optimal logistic vessel alternative based on cost/availability and emissions\n\n\nWhen it comes to the most optimal vessel for the case wind park, the result clearly shows that the service operation vessel provides more benefits in terms of overall grading for cost/availability and emissions. It comes out far better than the crew transfer vessel because of the sensitivity associated with the maximum wave height for this vessel. This causes a significantly higher downtime for the wind farm, and the analysis shows that the case can increase its turnover by \u20ac 13,844,000 by using a service operation vessel in favour of a crew transfer vessel concerning lost production.\n\nThe method used to carry out the analysis and simulation can be used as a starting point to provide the most optimal maintenance logistics strategy for each park. It can be common service operation vessel for several parks within the same field, several crew transfer vessels or make use of other logistical possibilities such as helicopters",

      "title": "Time series semi-Markov decision process with variable costs for maintenance planning",
      "abstract": "Deciding when and how to maintain offshore wind turbines is becoming even more complex as the size of wind farms increases, while accessibility is challenging compared to onshore wind farms. Planning future maintenance actions requires the wind farm operator to consider factors such as the current condition of the turbine, the cost of a given maintenance action, revenue generated by the asset, weather factors and vessel availability. Rather than making case-by-case decisions for each turbine, the approach described in this paper allows the wind farm operators to automate the process of short to-medium term maintenance planning through application of a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP). The model proposed here is capable of suggesting the cost-optimal maintenance policy given weather forecast, future vessel costs and availability and the current condition of the turbine. Using the semi-Markov approach, allows the user to implement time varying failure rate. As the model is capable of utilising time-series data, future weather and vessel constraints can be applied depending on the information available to the user at the time, which will be reflected in the optimal policy suggested by the model. The model proposed here facilitates maintenance decision making in wind farms and will lead to cost reduction through more efficient planning. In addition to that, the model can be used to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of using vessels with different properties",

      "abstract": "Climate change is a pressing global issue caused by increasing greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels for energy generation. The deployment of renewable generation is essential to mitigate climate change as it offers a sustainable and clean alternative energy. Following the success of bottom fixed wind, developers are looking to deeper waters to expand current development. This thesis delves into the complexities and challenges associated with the operation and maintenance of floating offshore wind farms. The research explores the unique hurdles presented by harnessing wind energy in deeper waters, such as increased distance to shore and uncharted areas. Floating wind sites also introduce specific operational challenges due to the\nmotion of the turbine which has a significant impact on the way in which offshore sites are both operated and maintained. This work consists of three distinct parts: identifying challenges, quantifying their impact, and proposing potential mitigating strategies. Through analysis and modelling of operational expenditure, the study identifies key challenges faced during the maintenance of floating wind farms, with a focus on technology-specific issues arising from turbine motion. Based on a review of current technology, future markets of deployment, and current operational challenges: location, scale, design convergence and turbine motion are identified as the key areas which are set to have a significant impact on the operation of future floating offshore sites. After identifying the challenges, their impact on the operational phase of the project is quantified. Through the use of offshore wind key performance indicators, the accessibility and total operational expenditure are determined for floating wind against an equivalent bottom fixed wind site. This then has a potentially significant impact on lost revenue which increases total cost. The increase in lost revenue is a result of reduced access due to additional restrictions placed on accessible conditions during specific turbine motion.\nAdditionally, the thesis quantifies the operational impact of these challenges and explores potential maintenance strategies to reduce OPEX, including the concept of opportunistic maintenance. The study introduces the OM+ framework, which identifies market-based opportunities for maintenance, aiming to enhance cost-effectiveness and efficiency. The thesis concludes with a comprehensive summary of the research findings and recommendations for future work, contributing to a sustainable and reliable renewable energy solution for the global energy landscape.Climate change is a pressing global issue caused by increasing greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels for energy generation.

The aim of this paper is to investigate if the floating foundation technology offers new\r\napproaches for the way offshore wind power plants are operated and maintained. The possibility to return the semisubmersible\r\nwind turbine to shore, allows that maintenance activities could be carried out near to shore (for\r\nexample in a dry dock) with fewer restrictions and lower cost.

In general, it can be concluded that with the current technology level, returning a semi-submersible\r\nfloating wind turbine for scheduled maintenance campaigns on a regular basis is not an economical and technical\r\nfeasible approach.

      "title": "Maintenance optimisation for wind turbines.",
      "abstract": "Wind is becoming an increasingly important source of energy for countries that ratify to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and mitigate the effects of global warming. Investments in wind farms are affected by inter-related assets and stakeholders requirements. These requirements demand a well-founded Asset Management (AM) frame-work which is currently lacking in the wind industry. Drawing from processes, tools and techniques of AM in other industries, a structured model for AM in the wind industry is developed. The model divulges that maintenance is indispensable to the core business objectives of the wind industry. However, the common maintenance strategies applied to wind turbines are inadequate to support the current commercial drivers of the wind industry. Consequently, a hybrid approach to the selection of a suitable maintenance strategy is developed. The approach is used in a case study to demonstrate its practical application. Suitable Condition-Based Maintenance activities for wind turbines are determined. Maintenance optimisation is a means to determine the most cost-effective maintenance strategy. Field failure and maintenance data of wind turbines are collected and analysed using two quantitative maintenance optimisation techniques; Modelling System Failures (MSF) and Delay-Time Maintenance Model (DTMM). The MSF permits the evaluation of life-data samples and enables the design and simulation of a systems model to determine optimum maintenance activities. Maximum Likelihood Estimation is used to estimate the shape (\u00ce\u00b2) and scale (\u00ce\u00b7) parameters of the Weibull distribution for critical components and subsystems of the wind turbines. Reliability Block Diagrams are designed using the estimated \u00ce\u00b2 and \u00ce\u00b7 to model the failures of the wind turbines and of a selected wind farm. The models are simulated to assess and optimise the reliability, availability and maintainability of the wind turbine and the farm. The DTMM examines equipment failure patterns by taking into account failure consequences, inspection time and cost in order to determine optimum inspection intervals. Defects rate (\u00ce\u00b1) and mean delay-time (1/\u00ce\u00b3) of components and subsystems within the wind turbine are estimated.

      "title": "The Jones Act and U.S. Offshore Wind Turbine Installation Strategies\n\nA qualitative analysis of the strategic implications of the Jones Act on the transport and installation of wind turbine generators in the U.S. offshore wind industry",
      "abstract": "This thesis explores the regulatory and strategic impacts of the Jones Act on the transport and installation of wind turbine generators in the U.S. offshore wind industry. The research specifically addresses two primary questions:  \n\u2022How does the Jones Act impact the transport and installation of wind turbine generators in the U.S. offshore wind industry? \n\u2022What is the best overall solution to comply with Jones Act, for transport and installation of wind turbine generators in the U.S.?  \nThe U.S. has significant ambitions to expand its offshore wind capacity, with a federal target to deploy 30 gigawatts by 2030. The Jones Act, a century-old maritime law, presents both challenges and opportunities in this context. It requires that transportation between U.S. ports is performed by U.S. flagged vessels, which has significant impact on the transport and installation of wind turbine generators for offshore wind farm developments in the U.S. This study identifies two main methods for transport and installation of wind turbine generators: \n\u2022U.S. flagged Wind Turbine Installation Vessel  \n\u2022Foreign flagged Wind Turbine Installation Vessel with feeder barges \nThe thesis is based on a qualitative method using semi structured interviews with four key strategic stakeholders from the industry. This research is organized by using the Gioia method and supported by established guidelines about how to do qualitative research and case studies.\nThe thesis concludes that neither of the strategies are clearly better than the other across all aspects. The strategic decisions must consider specific project needs, stakeholder priorities, and the regulatory landscape. However, based on the favorable operational workability, this thesis outlines the U.S. flagged installation vessel as the best solution in the long-term perspective, despite the higher upfront capital investment. On the other hand, the foreign-flagged WTIVs with feeder barges present a lower upfront investment but may lead to increased operational complexities and challenges",

      "title": "Time series semi-Markov decision process with variable costs for maintenance planning",
      "abstract": "Deciding when and how to maintain offshore wind turbines is becoming even more complex as the size of wind farms increases, while accessibility is challenging compared to onshore wind farms. Planning future maintenance actions requires the wind farm operator to consider factors such as the current condition of the turbine, the cost of a given maintenance action, revenue generated by the asset, weather factors and vessel availability. Rather than making case-by-case decisions for each turbine, the approach described in this paper allows the wind farm operators to automate the process of short to-medium term maintenance planning through application of a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP). The model proposed here is capable of suggesting the cost-optimal maintenance policy given weather forecast, future vessel costs and availability and the current condition of the turbine. Using the semi-Markov approach, allows the user to implement time varying failure rate. As the model is capable of utilising time-series data, future weather and vessel constraints can be applied depending on the information available to the user at the time, which will be reflected in the optimal policy suggested by the model. The model proposed here facilitates maintenance decision making in wind farms and will lead to cost reduction through more efficient planning. In addition to that, the model can be used to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of using vessels with different properties",
