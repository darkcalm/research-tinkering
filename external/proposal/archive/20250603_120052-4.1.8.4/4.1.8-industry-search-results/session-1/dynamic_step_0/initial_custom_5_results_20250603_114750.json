      "title": "AI for the Common Good?! Pitfalls, challenges, and Ethics Pen-Testing",
      "abstract": "Recently, many AI researchers and practitioners have embarked on research\nvisions that involve doing AI for \"Good\". This is part of a general drive\ntowards infusing AI research and practice with ethical thinking. One frequent\ntheme in current ethical guidelines is the requirement that AI be good for all,\nor: contribute to the Common Good. But what is the Common Good, and is it\nenough to want to be good? Via four lead questions, I will illustrate\nchallenges and pitfalls when determining, from an AI point of view, what the\nCommon Good is and how it can be enhanced by AI. The questions are: What is the\nproblem / What is a problem?, Who defines the problem?, What is the role of\nknowledge?, and What are important side effects and dynamics? The illustration\nwill use an example from the domain of \"AI for Social Good\", more specifically\n\"Data Science for Social Good\". Even if the importance of these questions may\nbe known at an abstract level, they do not get asked sufficiently in practice,\nas shown by an exploratory study of 99 contributions to recent conferences in\nthe field. Turning these challenges and pitfalls into a positive\nrecommendation, as a conclusion I will draw on another characteristic of\ncomputer-science thinking and practice to make these impediments visible and\nattenuate them: \"attacks\" as a method for improving design. This results in the\nproposal of ethics pen-testing as a method for helping AI designs to better\ncontribute to the Common Good.Comment: to appear in Paladyn.

      "abstract": "The 2023 Policy Papers analyze the impact of AI and automation on marginalized communities in three crucial areas: 1) In  Regulating Facial Recognition Technology to Reduce Bias  Khortlan Becton, JD, MTS, explores the urgent need to regulate AI to eradicate existing and potential policies and practices that dispro-portionately discriminate against African Americans and minorities. Becton proposes the creation of a new federal agency to regulate AI. 2) In  Automation and Artificial Intelligence in the Field of Social Work: Understanding Technology in Practice  Susan Elswick, EdD, LCSW, a faculty member in the University of Memphis School of Social Work, seeks a path to us-ing AI and Automation to provide social work counseling to those in need. Elswick not only explores how effective cli-ent counseling is dependent upon access and ability to use technology by clients but also argues that social workers require formal training from institutions of higher learning on how to use AI and automation to benefit their clients. 3) In  The Impact of Automation on Our Workforce  Meka Egwuekwe, MS, founder and executive director of Code Crew, approaches AI and automation from the per-spective of a practitioner who teaches others to write computer code. Recognizing that the world is experiencing a revolution in how work is performed, Egwuekwe proposes recommendations that reskill or upskill the workforce, increased support for startups and small businesses, and a societal framework that will embrace universal basic income as a resource to aid those displaced by AI and Automation",

Our findings highlight the breadth of sensemaking practices in AI/ML projects, noting developers' efforts to make sense of AI/ML environments (e.g., algorithms/methods and libraries), of AI/ML model ecosystems (e.g., pre-trained models and \"upstream\"models), and of business-AI relations (e.g., how the AI/ML service relates to the domain context and business problem at hand). This paper builds on recent scholarship drawing attention to the integral role of sensemaking in everyday SE practices by empirically investigating how and in what ways AI/ML projects present software teams with emergent sensemaking requirements and opportunities",

      "title": "Full-field and anomaly initialization using a low-order climate model: a comparison and proposals for advanced formulations",
      "abstract": "Initialization techniques for seasonal-to-decadal climate predictions fall into two main categories; namely full-field initialization (FFI) and anomaly initialization (AI). In the FFI case the initial model state is replaced by the best possible available estimate of the real state. By doing so the initial error is efficiently reduced but, due to the unavoidable presence of model deficiencies, once the model is let free to run a prediction, its trajectory drifts away from the observations no matter how small the initial error is. This problem is partly overcome with AI where the aim is to forecast future anomalies by assimilating observed anomalies on an estimate of the model climate.\n\n\n\nThe large variety of experimental setups, models and observational networks adopted worldwide make it difficult to draw firm conclusions on the respective advantages and drawbacks of FFI and AI, or to identify distinctive lines for improvement. The lack of a unified mathematical framework adds an additional difficulty toward the design of adequate initialization strategies that fit the desired forecast horizon, observational network and model at hand.\n\n\n\nHere we compare FFI and AI using a low-order climate model of nine ordinary differential equations and use the notation and concepts of data assimilation theory to highlight their error scaling properties. This analysis suggests better performances using FFI when a good observational network is available and reveals the direct relation of its skill with the observational accuracy. The skill of AI appears, however, mostly related to the model quality and clear increases of skill can only be expected in coincidence with model upgrades.\n\n\n\nWe have compared FFI and AI in experiments in which either the full system or the atmosphere and ocean were independently initialized. In the former case FFI shows better and longer-lasting improvements, with skillful predictions until month 30. In the initialization of single compartments, the best performance is obtained when the stabler component of the model (the ocean) is initialized, but with FFI it is possible to have some predictive skill even when the most unstable compartment (the extratropical atmosphere) is observed.\n\n\n\nTwo advanced formulations, least-square initialization (LSI) and exploring parameter uncertainty (EPU), are introduced. Using LSI the initialization makes use of model statistics to propagate information from observation locations to the entire model domain. Numerical results show that LSI improves the performance of FFI in all the situations when only a portion of the system's state is observed. EPU is an online drift correction method in which the drift caused by the parametric error is estimated using a short-time evolution law and is then removed during the forecast run. Its implementation in conjunction with FFI allows us to improve the prediction skill within the first forecast year.\n\n\n\nFinally, the application of these results in the context of realistic climate models is discussed",

      "abstract": "Recently, many AI researchers and practitioners have embarked on research\nvisions that involve doing AI for \"Good\". This is part of a general drive\ntowards infusing AI research and practice with ethical thinking. One frequent\ntheme in current ethical guidelines is the requirement that AI be good for all,\nor: contribute to the Common Good. But what is the Common Good, and is it\nenough to want to be good? Via four lead questions, I will illustrate\nchallenges and pitfalls when determining, from an AI point of view, what the\nCommon Good is and how it can be enhanced by AI. The questions are: What is the\nproblem / What is a problem?, Who defines the problem?, What is the role of\nknowledge?, and What are important side effects and dynamics? The illustration\nwill use an example from the domain of \"AI for Social Good\", more specifically\n\"Data Science for Social Good\". Even if the importance of these questions may\nbe known at an abstract level, they do not get asked sufficiently in practice,\nas shown by an exploratory study of 99 contributions to recent conferences in\nthe field. Turning these challenges and pitfalls into a positive\nrecommendation, as a conclusion I will draw on another characteristic of\ncomputer-science thinking and practice to make these impediments visible and\nattenuate them: \"attacks\" as a method for improving design. This results in the\nproposal of ethics pen-testing as a method for helping AI designs to better\ncontribute to the Common Good.Comment: to appear in Paladyn.

      "abstract": "The 2023 Policy Papers analyze the impact of AI and automation on marginalized communities in three crucial areas: 1) In  Regulating Facial Recognition Technology to Reduce Bias  Khortlan Becton, JD, MTS, explores the urgent need to regulate AI to eradicate existing and potential policies and practices that dispro-portionately discriminate against African Americans and minorities. Becton proposes the creation of a new federal agency to regulate AI. 2) In  Automation and Artificial Intelligence in the Field of Social Work: Understanding Technology in Practice  Susan Elswick, EdD, LCSW, a faculty member in the University of Memphis School of Social Work, seeks a path to us-ing AI and Automation to provide social work counseling to those in need. Elswick not only explores how effective cli-ent counseling is dependent upon access and ability to use technology by clients but also argues that social workers require formal training from institutions of higher learning on how to use AI and automation to benefit their clients. 3) In  The Impact of Automation on Our Workforce  Meka Egwuekwe, MS, founder and executive director of Code Crew, approaches AI and automation from the per-spective of a practitioner who teaches others to write computer code. Recognizing that the world is experiencing a revolution in how work is performed, Egwuekwe proposes recommendations that reskill or upskill the workforce, increased support for startups and small businesses, and a societal framework that will embrace universal basic income as a resource to aid those displaced by AI and Automation",

Our findings highlight the breadth of sensemaking practices in AI/ML projects, noting developers' efforts to make sense of AI/ML environments (e.g., algorithms/methods and libraries), of AI/ML model ecosystems (e.g., pre-trained models and \"upstream\"models), and of business-AI relations (e.g., how the AI/ML service relates to the domain context and business problem at hand). This paper builds on recent scholarship drawing attention to the integral role of sensemaking in everyday SE practices by empirically investigating how and in what ways AI/ML projects present software teams with emergent sensemaking requirements and opportunities",

      "title": "Full-field and anomaly initialization using a low-order climate model: a comparison and proposals for advanced formulations",
      "abstract": "Initialization techniques for seasonal-to-decadal climate predictions fall into two main categories; namely full-field initialization (FFI) and anomaly initialization (AI). In the FFI case the initial model state is replaced by the best possible available estimate of the real state. By doing so the initial error is efficiently reduced but, due to the unavoidable presence of model deficiencies, once the model is let free to run a prediction, its trajectory drifts away from the observations no matter how small the initial error is. This problem is partly overcome with AI where the aim is to forecast future anomalies by assimilating observed anomalies on an estimate of the model climate.\n\n\n\nThe large variety of experimental setups, models and observational networks adopted worldwide make it difficult to draw firm conclusions on the respective advantages and drawbacks of FFI and AI, or to identify distinctive lines for improvement. The lack of a unified mathematical framework adds an additional difficulty toward the design of adequate initialization strategies that fit the desired forecast horizon, observational network and model at hand.\n\n\n\nHere we compare FFI and AI using a low-order climate model of nine ordinary differential equations and use the notation and concepts of data assimilation theory to highlight their error scaling properties. This analysis suggests better performances using FFI when a good observational network is available and reveals the direct relation of its skill with the observational accuracy. The skill of AI appears, however, mostly related to the model quality and clear increases of skill can only be expected in coincidence with model upgrades.\n\n\n\nWe have compared FFI and AI in experiments in which either the full system or the atmosphere and ocean were independently initialized. In the former case FFI shows better and longer-lasting improvements, with skillful predictions until month 30. In the initialization of single compartments, the best performance is obtained when the stabler component of the model (the ocean) is initialized, but with FFI it is possible to have some predictive skill even when the most unstable compartment (the extratropical atmosphere) is observed.\n\n\n\nTwo advanced formulations, least-square initialization (LSI) and exploring parameter uncertainty (EPU), are introduced. Using LSI the initialization makes use of model statistics to propagate information from observation locations to the entire model domain. Numerical results show that LSI improves the performance of FFI in all the situations when only a portion of the system's state is observed. EPU is an online drift correction method in which the drift caused by the parametric error is estimated using a short-time evolution law and is then removed during the forecast run. Its implementation in conjunction with FFI allows us to improve the prediction skill within the first forecast year.\n\n\n\nFinally, the application of these results in the context of realistic climate models is discussed",

More recently, technological breakthroughs, coupled with the fast availability of data, have brought AI closer to commercial use. Internet giants such as Google, Amazon, Apple or Facebook invest significantly into AI, thereby underlining its relevance for business models worldwide. For the highly data driven finance industry, AI is of intensive interest within pilot projects, still, few AI applications have been implemented so far. This study analyzes drivers and inhibitors of a successful AI application in the finance industry based on panel data comprising 22 semi-structured interviews with experts in AI in finance. As theoretical lens, we structured our results using the TOE framework. Guidelines for applying AI successfully reveal AI-specific role models and process competencies as crucial, before trained algorithms will have reached a quality level on which AI applications will operate without human intervention and moral concerns",

      "title": "AI for the Common Good?! Pitfalls, challenges, and Ethics Pen-Testing",
      "abstract": "Recently, many AI researchers and practitioners have embarked on research\nvisions that involve doing AI for \"Good\". This is part of a general drive\ntowards infusing AI research and practice with ethical thinking. One frequent\ntheme in current ethical guidelines is the requirement that AI be good for all,\nor: contribute to the Common Good. But what is the Common Good, and is it\nenough to want to be good? Via four lead questions, I will illustrate\nchallenges and pitfalls when determining, from an AI point of view, what the\nCommon Good is and how it can be enhanced by AI. The questions are: What is the\nproblem / What is a problem?, Who defines the problem?, What is the role of\nknowledge?, and What are important side effects and dynamics? The illustration\nwill use an example from the domain of \"AI for Social Good\", more specifically\n\"Data Science for Social Good\". Even if the importance of these questions may\nbe known at an abstract level, they do not get asked sufficiently in practice,\nas shown by an exploratory study of 99 contributions to recent conferences in\nthe field. Turning these challenges and pitfalls into a positive\nrecommendation, as a conclusion I will draw on another characteristic of\ncomputer-science thinking and practice to make these impediments visible and\nattenuate them: \"attacks\" as a method for improving design. This results in the\nproposal of ethics pen-testing as a method for helping AI designs to better\ncontribute to the Common Good.Comment: to appear in Paladyn.

      "abstract": "The 2023 Policy Papers analyze the impact of AI and automation on marginalized communities in three crucial areas: 1) In  Regulating Facial Recognition Technology to Reduce Bias  Khortlan Becton, JD, MTS, explores the urgent need to regulate AI to eradicate existing and potential policies and practices that dispro-portionately discriminate against African Americans and minorities. Becton proposes the creation of a new federal agency to regulate AI. 2) In  Automation and Artificial Intelligence in the Field of Social Work: Understanding Technology in Practice  Susan Elswick, EdD, LCSW, a faculty member in the University of Memphis School of Social Work, seeks a path to us-ing AI and Automation to provide social work counseling to those in need. Elswick not only explores how effective cli-ent counseling is dependent upon access and ability to use technology by clients but also argues that social workers require formal training from institutions of higher learning on how to use AI and automation to benefit their clients. 3) In  The Impact of Automation on Our Workforce  Meka Egwuekwe, MS, founder and executive director of Code Crew, approaches AI and automation from the per-spective of a practitioner who teaches others to write computer code. Recognizing that the world is experiencing a revolution in how work is performed, Egwuekwe proposes recommendations that reskill or upskill the workforce, increased support for startups and small businesses, and a societal framework that will embrace universal basic income as a resource to aid those displaced by AI and Automation",

Our findings highlight the breadth of sensemaking practices in AI/ML projects, noting developers' efforts to make sense of AI/ML environments (e.g., algorithms/methods and libraries), of AI/ML model ecosystems (e.g., pre-trained models and \"upstream\"models), and of business-AI relations (e.g., how the AI/ML service relates to the domain context and business problem at hand). This paper builds on recent scholarship drawing attention to the integral role of sensemaking in everyday SE practices by empirically investigating how and in what ways AI/ML projects present software teams with emergent sensemaking requirements and opportunities",

      "title": "Full-field and anomaly initialization using a low-order climate model: a comparison and proposals for advanced formulations",
      "abstract": "Initialization techniques for seasonal-to-decadal climate predictions fall into two main categories; namely full-field initialization (FFI) and anomaly initialization (AI). In the FFI case the initial model state is replaced by the best possible available estimate of the real state. By doing so the initial error is efficiently reduced but, due to the unavoidable presence of model deficiencies, once the model is let free to run a prediction, its trajectory drifts away from the observations no matter how small the initial error is. This problem is partly overcome with AI where the aim is to forecast future anomalies by assimilating observed anomalies on an estimate of the model climate.\n\n\n\nThe large variety of experimental setups, models and observational networks adopted worldwide make it difficult to draw firm conclusions on the respective advantages and drawbacks of FFI and AI, or to identify distinctive lines for improvement. The lack of a unified mathematical framework adds an additional difficulty toward the design of adequate initialization strategies that fit the desired forecast horizon, observational network and model at hand.\n\n\n\nHere we compare FFI and AI using a low-order climate model of nine ordinary differential equations and use the notation and concepts of data assimilation theory to highlight their error scaling properties. This analysis suggests better performances using FFI when a good observational network is available and reveals the direct relation of its skill with the observational accuracy. The skill of AI appears, however, mostly related to the model quality and clear increases of skill can only be expected in coincidence with model upgrades.\n\n\n\nWe have compared FFI and AI in experiments in which either the full system or the atmosphere and ocean were independently initialized. In the former case FFI shows better and longer-lasting improvements, with skillful predictions until month 30. In the initialization of single compartments, the best performance is obtained when the stabler component of the model (the ocean) is initialized, but with FFI it is possible to have some predictive skill even when the most unstable compartment (the extratropical atmosphere) is observed.\n\n\n\nTwo advanced formulations, least-square initialization (LSI) and exploring parameter uncertainty (EPU), are introduced. Using LSI the initialization makes use of model statistics to propagate information from observation locations to the entire model domain. Numerical results show that LSI improves the performance of FFI in all the situations when only a portion of the system's state is observed. EPU is an online drift correction method in which the drift caused by the parametric error is estimated using a short-time evolution law and is then removed during the forecast run. Its implementation in conjunction with FFI allows us to improve the prediction skill within the first forecast year.\n\n\n\nFinally, the application of these results in the context of realistic climate models is discussed",

      "abstract": "As a research field, artificial intelligence (AI) exists for several years. More recently, technological breakthroughs, coupled with the fast availability of data, have brought AI closer to commercial use. Internet giants such as Google, Amazon, Apple or Facebook invest significantly into AI, thereby underlining its relevance for business models worldwide. For the highly data driven finance industry, AI is of intensive interest within pilot projects, still, few AI applications have been implemented so far. This study analyzes drivers and inhibitors of a successful AI application in the finance industry based on panel data comprising 22 semi-structured interviews with experts in AI in finance. As theoretical lens, we structured our results using the TOE framework. Guidelines for applying AI successfully reveal AI-specific role models and process competencies as crucial, before trained algorithms will have reached a quality level on which AI applications will operate without human intervention and moral concerns",

      "title": "AI for the Common Good?! Pitfalls, challenges, and Ethics Pen-Testing",
      "abstract": "Recently, many AI researchers and practitioners have embarked on research\nvisions that involve doing AI for \"Good\". This is part of a general drive\ntowards infusing AI research and practice with ethical thinking. One frequent\ntheme in current ethical guidelines is the requirement that AI be good for all,\nor: contribute to the Common Good. But what is the Common Good, and is it\nenough to want to be good? Via four lead questions, I will illustrate\nchallenges and pitfalls when determining, from an AI point of view, what the\nCommon Good is and how it can be enhanced by AI. The questions are: What is the\nproblem / What is a problem?, Who defines the problem?, What is the role of\nknowledge?, and What are important side effects and dynamics? The illustration\nwill use an example from the domain of \"AI for Social Good\", more specifically\n\"Data Science for Social Good\". Even if the importance of these questions may\nbe known at an abstract level, they do not get asked sufficiently in practice,\nas shown by an exploratory study of 99 contributions to recent conferences in\nthe field. Turning these challenges and pitfalls into a positive\nrecommendation, as a conclusion I will draw on another characteristic of\ncomputer-science thinking and practice to make these impediments visible and\nattenuate them: \"attacks\" as a method for improving design. This results in the\nproposal of ethics pen-testing as a method for helping AI designs to better\ncontribute to the Common Good.Comment: to appear in Paladyn.

      "abstract": "The 2023 Policy Papers analyze the impact of AI and automation on marginalized communities in three crucial areas: 1) In  Regulating Facial Recognition Technology to Reduce Bias  Khortlan Becton, JD, MTS, explores the urgent need to regulate AI to eradicate existing and potential policies and practices that dispro-portionately discriminate against African Americans and minorities. Becton proposes the creation of a new federal agency to regulate AI. 2) In  Automation and Artificial Intelligence in the Field of Social Work: Understanding Technology in Practice  Susan Elswick, EdD, LCSW, a faculty member in the University of Memphis School of Social Work, seeks a path to us-ing AI and Automation to provide social work counseling to those in need. Elswick not only explores how effective cli-ent counseling is dependent upon access and ability to use technology by clients but also argues that social workers require formal training from institutions of higher learning on how to use AI and automation to benefit their clients. 3) In  The Impact of Automation on Our Workforce  Meka Egwuekwe, MS, founder and executive director of Code Crew, approaches AI and automation from the per-spective of a practitioner who teaches others to write computer code. Recognizing that the world is experiencing a revolution in how work is performed, Egwuekwe proposes recommendations that reskill or upskill the workforce, increased support for startups and small businesses, and a societal framework that will embrace universal basic income as a resource to aid those displaced by AI and Automation",

Our findings highlight the breadth of sensemaking practices in AI/ML projects, noting developers' efforts to make sense of AI/ML environments (e.g., algorithms/methods and libraries), of AI/ML model ecosystems (e.g., pre-trained models and \"upstream\"models), and of business-AI relations (e.g., how the AI/ML service relates to the domain context and business problem at hand). This paper builds on recent scholarship drawing attention to the integral role of sensemaking in everyday SE practices by empirically investigating how and in what ways AI/ML projects present software teams with emergent sensemaking requirements and opportunities",

      "title": "Full-field and anomaly initialization using a low-order climate model: a comparison and proposals for advanced formulations",
      "abstract": "Initialization techniques for seasonal-to-decadal climate predictions fall into two main categories; namely full-field initialization (FFI) and anomaly initialization (AI). In the FFI case the initial model state is replaced by the best possible available estimate of the real state. By doing so the initial error is efficiently reduced but, due to the unavoidable presence of model deficiencies, once the model is let free to run a prediction, its trajectory drifts away from the observations no matter how small the initial error is. This problem is partly overcome with AI where the aim is to forecast future anomalies by assimilating observed anomalies on an estimate of the model climate.\n\n\n\nThe large variety of experimental setups, models and observational networks adopted worldwide make it difficult to draw firm conclusions on the respective advantages and drawbacks of FFI and AI, or to identify distinctive lines for improvement. The lack of a unified mathematical framework adds an additional difficulty toward the design of adequate initialization strategies that fit the desired forecast horizon, observational network and model at hand.\n\n\n\nHere we compare FFI and AI using a low-order climate model of nine ordinary differential equations and use the notation and concepts of data assimilation theory to highlight their error scaling properties. This analysis suggests better performances using FFI when a good observational network is available and reveals the direct relation of its skill with the observational accuracy. The skill of AI appears, however, mostly related to the model quality and clear increases of skill can only be expected in coincidence with model upgrades.\n\n\n\nWe have compared FFI and AI in experiments in which either the full system or the atmosphere and ocean were independently initialized. In the former case FFI shows better and longer-lasting improvements, with skillful predictions until month 30. In the initialization of single compartments, the best performance is obtained when the stabler component of the model (the ocean) is initialized, but with FFI it is possible to have some predictive skill even when the most unstable compartment (the extratropical atmosphere) is observed.\n\n\n\nTwo advanced formulations, least-square initialization (LSI) and exploring parameter uncertainty (EPU), are introduced. Using LSI the initialization makes use of model statistics to propagate information from observation locations to the entire model domain. Numerical results show that LSI improves the performance of FFI in all the situations when only a portion of the system's state is observed. EPU is an online drift correction method in which the drift caused by the parametric error is estimated using a short-time evolution law and is then removed during the forecast run. Its implementation in conjunction with FFI allows us to improve the prediction skill within the first forecast year.\n\n\n\nFinally, the application of these results in the context of realistic climate models is discussed",

More recently, technological breakthroughs, coupled with the fast availability of data, have brought AI closer to commercial use. Internet giants such as Google, Amazon, Apple or Facebook invest significantly into AI, thereby underlining its relevance for business models worldwide. For the highly data driven finance industry, AI is of intensive interest within pilot projects, still, few AI applications have been implemented so far. This study analyzes drivers and inhibitors of a successful AI application in the finance industry based on panel data comprising 22 semi-structured interviews with experts in AI in finance. As theoretical lens, we structured our results using the TOE framework. Guidelines for applying AI successfully reveal AI-specific role models and process competencies as crucial, before trained algorithms will have reached a quality level on which AI applications will operate without human intervention and moral concerns",

      "title": "AI for the Common Good?! Pitfalls, challenges, and Ethics Pen-Testing",
      "abstract": "Recently, many AI researchers and practitioners have embarked on research\nvisions that involve doing AI for \"Good\". This is part of a general drive\ntowards infusing AI research and practice with ethical thinking. One frequent\ntheme in current ethical guidelines is the requirement that AI be good for all,\nor: contribute to the Common Good. But what is the Common Good, and is it\nenough to want to be good? Via four lead questions, I will illustrate\nchallenges and pitfalls when determining, from an AI point of view, what the\nCommon Good is and how it can be enhanced by AI. The questions are: What is the\nproblem / What is a problem?, Who defines the problem?, What is the role of\nknowledge?, and What are important side effects and dynamics? The illustration\nwill use an example from the domain of \"AI for Social Good\", more specifically\n\"Data Science for Social Good\". Even if the importance of these questions may\nbe known at an abstract level, they do not get asked sufficiently in practice,\nas shown by an exploratory study of 99 contributions to recent conferences in\nthe field. Turning these challenges and pitfalls into a positive\nrecommendation, as a conclusion I will draw on another characteristic of\ncomputer-science thinking and practice to make these impediments visible and\nattenuate them: \"attacks\" as a method for improving design. This results in the\nproposal of ethics pen-testing as a method for helping AI designs to better\ncontribute to the Common Good.Comment: to appear in Paladyn.

      "abstract": "The 2023 Policy Papers analyze the impact of AI and automation on marginalized communities in three crucial areas: 1) In  Regulating Facial Recognition Technology to Reduce Bias  Khortlan Becton, JD, MTS, explores the urgent need to regulate AI to eradicate existing and potential policies and practices that dispro-portionately discriminate against African Americans and minorities. Becton proposes the creation of a new federal agency to regulate AI. 2) In  Automation and Artificial Intelligence in the Field of Social Work: Understanding Technology in Practice  Susan Elswick, EdD, LCSW, a faculty member in the University of Memphis School of Social Work, seeks a path to us-ing AI and Automation to provide social work counseling to those in need. Elswick not only explores how effective cli-ent counseling is dependent upon access and ability to use technology by clients but also argues that social workers require formal training from institutions of higher learning on how to use AI and automation to benefit their clients. 3) In  The Impact of Automation on Our Workforce  Meka Egwuekwe, MS, founder and executive director of Code Crew, approaches AI and automation from the per-spective of a practitioner who teaches others to write computer code. Recognizing that the world is experiencing a revolution in how work is performed, Egwuekwe proposes recommendations that reskill or upskill the workforce, increased support for startups and small businesses, and a societal framework that will embrace universal basic income as a resource to aid those displaced by AI and Automation",

Our findings highlight the breadth of sensemaking practices in AI/ML projects, noting developers' efforts to make sense of AI/ML environments (e.g., algorithms/methods and libraries), of AI/ML model ecosystems (e.g., pre-trained models and \"upstream\"models), and of business-AI relations (e.g., how the AI/ML service relates to the domain context and business problem at hand). This paper builds on recent scholarship drawing attention to the integral role of sensemaking in everyday SE practices by empirically investigating how and in what ways AI/ML projects present software teams with emergent sensemaking requirements and opportunities",

      "title": "Full-field and anomaly initialization using a low-order climate model: a comparison and proposals for advanced formulations",
      "abstract": "Initialization techniques for seasonal-to-decadal climate predictions fall into two main categories; namely full-field initialization (FFI) and anomaly initialization (AI). In the FFI case the initial model state is replaced by the best possible available estimate of the real state. By doing so the initial error is efficiently reduced but, due to the unavoidable presence of model deficiencies, once the model is let free to run a prediction, its trajectory drifts away from the observations no matter how small the initial error is. This problem is partly overcome with AI where the aim is to forecast future anomalies by assimilating observed anomalies on an estimate of the model climate.\n\n\n\nThe large variety of experimental setups, models and observational networks adopted worldwide make it difficult to draw firm conclusions on the respective advantages and drawbacks of FFI and AI, or to identify distinctive lines for improvement. The lack of a unified mathematical framework adds an additional difficulty toward the design of adequate initialization strategies that fit the desired forecast horizon, observational network and model at hand.\n\n\n\nHere we compare FFI and AI using a low-order climate model of nine ordinary differential equations and use the notation and concepts of data assimilation theory to highlight their error scaling properties. This analysis suggests better performances using FFI when a good observational network is available and reveals the direct relation of its skill with the observational accuracy. The skill of AI appears, however, mostly related to the model quality and clear increases of skill can only be expected in coincidence with model upgrades.\n\n\n\nWe have compared FFI and AI in experiments in which either the full system or the atmosphere and ocean were independently initialized. In the former case FFI shows better and longer-lasting improvements, with skillful predictions until month 30. In the initialization of single compartments, the best performance is obtained when the stabler component of the model (the ocean) is initialized, but with FFI it is possible to have some predictive skill even when the most unstable compartment (the extratropical atmosphere) is observed.\n\n\n\nTwo advanced formulations, least-square initialization (LSI) and exploring parameter uncertainty (EPU), are introduced. Using LSI the initialization makes use of model statistics to propagate information from observation locations to the entire model domain. Numerical results show that LSI improves the performance of FFI in all the situations when only a portion of the system's state is observed. EPU is an online drift correction method in which the drift caused by the parametric error is estimated using a short-time evolution law and is then removed during the forecast run. Its implementation in conjunction with FFI allows us to improve the prediction skill within the first forecast year.\n\n\n\nFinally, the application of these results in the context of realistic climate models is discussed",

More recently, technological breakthroughs, coupled with the fast availability of data, have brought AI closer to commercial use. Internet giants such as Google, Amazon, Apple or Facebook invest significantly into AI, thereby underlining its relevance for business models worldwide. For the highly data driven finance industry, AI is of intensive interest within pilot projects, still, few AI applications have been implemented so far. This study analyzes drivers and inhibitors of a successful AI application in the finance industry based on panel data comprising 22 semi-structured interviews with experts in AI in finance. As theoretical lens, we structured our results using the TOE framework. Guidelines for applying AI successfully reveal AI-specific role models and process competencies as crucial, before trained algorithms will have reached a quality level on which AI applications will operate without human intervention and moral concerns",

      "title": "AI for the Common Good?! Pitfalls, challenges, and Ethics Pen-Testing",
      "abstract": "Recently, many AI researchers and practitioners have embarked on research\nvisions that involve doing AI for \"Good\". This is part of a general drive\ntowards infusing AI research and practice with ethical thinking. One frequent\ntheme in current ethical guidelines is the requirement that AI be good for all,\nor: contribute to the Common Good. But what is the Common Good, and is it\nenough to want to be good? Via four lead questions, I will illustrate\nchallenges and pitfalls when determining, from an AI point of view, what the\nCommon Good is and how it can be enhanced by AI. The questions are: What is the\nproblem / What is a problem?, Who defines the problem?, What is the role of\nknowledge?, and What are important side effects and dynamics? The illustration\nwill use an example from the domain of \"AI for Social Good\", more specifically\n\"Data Science for Social Good\". Even if the importance of these questions may\nbe known at an abstract level, they do not get asked sufficiently in practice,\nas shown by an exploratory study of 99 contributions to recent conferences in\nthe field. Turning these challenges and pitfalls into a positive\nrecommendation, as a conclusion I will draw on another characteristic of\ncomputer-science thinking and practice to make these impediments visible and\nattenuate them: \"attacks\" as a method for improving design. This results in the\nproposal of ethics pen-testing as a method for helping AI designs to better\ncontribute to the Common Good.Comment: to appear in Paladyn.

      "abstract": "The 2023 Policy Papers analyze the impact of AI and automation on marginalized communities in three crucial areas: 1) In  Regulating Facial Recognition Technology to Reduce Bias  Khortlan Becton, JD, MTS, explores the urgent need to regulate AI to eradicate existing and potential policies and practices that dispro-portionately discriminate against African Americans and minorities. Becton proposes the creation of a new federal agency to regulate AI. 2) In  Automation and Artificial Intelligence in the Field of Social Work: Understanding Technology in Practice  Susan Elswick, EdD, LCSW, a faculty member in the University of Memphis School of Social Work, seeks a path to us-ing AI and Automation to provide social work counseling to those in need. Elswick not only explores how effective cli-ent counseling is dependent upon access and ability to use technology by clients but also argues that social workers require formal training from institutions of higher learning on how to use AI and automation to benefit their clients. 3) In  The Impact of Automation on Our Workforce  Meka Egwuekwe, MS, founder and executive director of Code Crew, approaches AI and automation from the per-spective of a practitioner who teaches others to write computer code. Recognizing that the world is experiencing a revolution in how work is performed, Egwuekwe proposes recommendations that reskill or upskill the workforce, increased support for startups and small businesses, and a societal framework that will embrace universal basic income as a resource to aid those displaced by AI and Automation",

Our findings highlight the breadth of sensemaking practices in AI/ML projects, noting developers' efforts to make sense of AI/ML environments (e.g., algorithms/methods and libraries), of AI/ML model ecosystems (e.g., pre-trained models and \"upstream\"models), and of business-AI relations (e.g., how the AI/ML service relates to the domain context and business problem at hand). This paper builds on recent scholarship drawing attention to the integral role of sensemaking in everyday SE practices by empirically investigating how and in what ways AI/ML projects present software teams with emergent sensemaking requirements and opportunities",

      "title": "Full-field and anomaly initialization using a low-order climate model: a comparison and proposals for advanced formulations",
      "abstract": "Initialization techniques for seasonal-to-decadal climate predictions fall into two main categories; namely full-field initialization (FFI) and anomaly initialization (AI). In the FFI case the initial model state is replaced by the best possible available estimate of the real state. By doing so the initial error is efficiently reduced but, due to the unavoidable presence of model deficiencies, once the model is let free to run a prediction, its trajectory drifts away from the observations no matter how small the initial error is. This problem is partly overcome with AI where the aim is to forecast future anomalies by assimilating observed anomalies on an estimate of the model climate.\n\n\n\nThe large variety of experimental setups, models and observational networks adopted worldwide make it difficult to draw firm conclusions on the respective advantages and drawbacks of FFI and AI, or to identify distinctive lines for improvement. The lack of a unified mathematical framework adds an additional difficulty toward the design of adequate initialization strategies that fit the desired forecast horizon, observational network and model at hand.\n\n\n\nHere we compare FFI and AI using a low-order climate model of nine ordinary differential equations and use the notation and concepts of data assimilation theory to highlight their error scaling properties. This analysis suggests better performances using FFI when a good observational network is available and reveals the direct relation of its skill with the observational accuracy. The skill of AI appears, however, mostly related to the model quality and clear increases of skill can only be expected in coincidence with model upgrades.\n\n\n\nWe have compared FFI and AI in experiments in which either the full system or the atmosphere and ocean were independently initialized. In the former case FFI shows better and longer-lasting improvements, with skillful predictions until month 30. In the initialization of single compartments, the best performance is obtained when the stabler component of the model (the ocean) is initialized, but with FFI it is possible to have some predictive skill even when the most unstable compartment (the extratropical atmosphere) is observed.\n\n\n\nTwo advanced formulations, least-square initialization (LSI) and exploring parameter uncertainty (EPU), are introduced. Using LSI the initialization makes use of model statistics to propagate information from observation locations to the entire model domain. Numerical results show that LSI improves the performance of FFI in all the situations when only a portion of the system's state is observed. EPU is an online drift correction method in which the drift caused by the parametric error is estimated using a short-time evolution law and is then removed during the forecast run. Its implementation in conjunction with FFI allows us to improve the prediction skill within the first forecast year.\n\n\n\nFinally, the application of these results in the context of realistic climate models is discussed",

More recently, technological breakthroughs, coupled with the fast availability of data, have brought AI closer to commercial use. Internet giants such as Google, Amazon, Apple or Facebook invest significantly into AI, thereby underlining its relevance for business models worldwide. For the highly data driven finance industry, AI is of intensive interest within pilot projects, still, few AI applications have been implemented so far. This study analyzes drivers and inhibitors of a successful AI application in the finance industry based on panel data comprising 22 semi-structured interviews with experts in AI in finance. As theoretical lens, we structured our results using the TOE framework. Guidelines for applying AI successfully reveal AI-specific role models and process competencies as crucial, before trained algorithms will have reached a quality level on which AI applications will operate without human intervention and moral concerns",

      "title": "AI for the Common Good?! Pitfalls, challenges, and Ethics Pen-Testing",
      "abstract": "Recently, many AI researchers and practitioners have embarked on research\nvisions that involve doing AI for \"Good\". This is part of a general drive\ntowards infusing AI research and practice with ethical thinking. One frequent\ntheme in current ethical guidelines is the requirement that AI be good for all,\nor: contribute to the Common Good. But what is the Common Good, and is it\nenough to want to be good? Via four lead questions, I will illustrate\nchallenges and pitfalls when determining, from an AI point of view, what the\nCommon Good is and how it can be enhanced by AI. The questions are: What is the\nproblem / What is a problem?, Who defines the problem?, What is the role of\nknowledge?, and What are important side effects and dynamics? The illustration\nwill use an example from the domain of \"AI for Social Good\", more specifically\n\"Data Science for Social Good\". Even if the importance of these questions may\nbe known at an abstract level, they do not get asked sufficiently in practice,\nas shown by an exploratory study of 99 contributions to recent conferences in\nthe field. Turning these challenges and pitfalls into a positive\nrecommendation, as a conclusion I will draw on another characteristic of\ncomputer-science thinking and practice to make these impediments visible and\nattenuate them: \"attacks\" as a method for improving design. This results in the\nproposal of ethics pen-testing as a method for helping AI designs to better\ncontribute to the Common Good.Comment: to appear in Paladyn.

      "abstract": "The 2023 Policy Papers analyze the impact of AI and automation on marginalized communities in three crucial areas: 1) In  Regulating Facial Recognition Technology to Reduce Bias  Khortlan Becton, JD, MTS, explores the urgent need to regulate AI to eradicate existing and potential policies and practices that dispro-portionately discriminate against African Americans and minorities. Becton proposes the creation of a new federal agency to regulate AI. 2) In  Automation and Artificial Intelligence in the Field of Social Work: Understanding Technology in Practice  Susan Elswick, EdD, LCSW, a faculty member in the University of Memphis School of Social Work, seeks a path to us-ing AI and Automation to provide social work counseling to those in need. Elswick not only explores how effective cli-ent counseling is dependent upon access and ability to use technology by clients but also argues that social workers require formal training from institutions of higher learning on how to use AI and automation to benefit their clients. 3) In  The Impact of Automation on Our Workforce  Meka Egwuekwe, MS, founder and executive director of Code Crew, approaches AI and automation from the per-spective of a practitioner who teaches others to write computer code. Recognizing that the world is experiencing a revolution in how work is performed, Egwuekwe proposes recommendations that reskill or upskill the workforce, increased support for startups and small businesses, and a societal framework that will embrace universal basic income as a resource to aid those displaced by AI and Automation",

Our findings highlight the breadth of sensemaking practices in AI/ML projects, noting developers' efforts to make sense of AI/ML environments (e.g., algorithms/methods and libraries), of AI/ML model ecosystems (e.g., pre-trained models and \"upstream\"models), and of business-AI relations (e.g., how the AI/ML service relates to the domain context and business problem at hand). This paper builds on recent scholarship drawing attention to the integral role of sensemaking in everyday SE practices by empirically investigating how and in what ways AI/ML projects present software teams with emergent sensemaking requirements and opportunities",

      "title": "Full-field and anomaly initialization using a low-order climate model: a comparison and proposals for advanced formulations",
      "abstract": "Initialization techniques for seasonal-to-decadal climate predictions fall into two main categories; namely full-field initialization (FFI) and anomaly initialization (AI). In the FFI case the initial model state is replaced by the best possible available estimate of the real state. By doing so the initial error is efficiently reduced but, due to the unavoidable presence of model deficiencies, once the model is let free to run a prediction, its trajectory drifts away from the observations no matter how small the initial error is. This problem is partly overcome with AI where the aim is to forecast future anomalies by assimilating observed anomalies on an estimate of the model climate.\n\n\n\nThe large variety of experimental setups, models and observational networks adopted worldwide make it difficult to draw firm conclusions on the respective advantages and drawbacks of FFI and AI, or to identify distinctive lines for improvement. The lack of a unified mathematical framework adds an additional difficulty toward the design of adequate initialization strategies that fit the desired forecast horizon, observational network and model at hand.\n\n\n\nHere we compare FFI and AI using a low-order climate model of nine ordinary differential equations and use the notation and concepts of data assimilation theory to highlight their error scaling properties. This analysis suggests better performances using FFI when a good observational network is available and reveals the direct relation of its skill with the observational accuracy. The skill of AI appears, however, mostly related to the model quality and clear increases of skill can only be expected in coincidence with model upgrades.\n\n\n\nWe have compared FFI and AI in experiments in which either the full system or the atmosphere and ocean were independently initialized. In the former case FFI shows better and longer-lasting improvements, with skillful predictions until month 30. In the initialization of single compartments, the best performance is obtained when the stabler component of the model (the ocean) is initialized, but with FFI it is possible to have some predictive skill even when the most unstable compartment (the extratropical atmosphere) is observed.\n\n\n\nTwo advanced formulations, least-square initialization (LSI) and exploring parameter uncertainty (EPU), are introduced. Using LSI the initialization makes use of model statistics to propagate information from observation locations to the entire model domain. Numerical results show that LSI improves the performance of FFI in all the situations when only a portion of the system's state is observed. EPU is an online drift correction method in which the drift caused by the parametric error is estimated using a short-time evolution law and is then removed during the forecast run. Its implementation in conjunction with FFI allows us to improve the prediction skill within the first forecast year.\n\n\n\nFinally, the application of these results in the context of realistic climate models is discussed",

More recently, technological breakthroughs, coupled with the fast availability of data, have brought AI closer to commercial use. Internet giants such as Google, Amazon, Apple or Facebook invest significantly into AI, thereby underlining its relevance for business models worldwide. For the highly data driven finance industry, AI is of intensive interest within pilot projects, still, few AI applications have been implemented so far. This study analyzes drivers and inhibitors of a successful AI application in the finance industry based on panel data comprising 22 semi-structured interviews with experts in AI in finance. As theoretical lens, we structured our results using the TOE framework. Guidelines for applying AI successfully reveal AI-specific role models and process competencies as crucial, before trained algorithms will have reached a quality level on which AI applications will operate without human intervention and moral concerns",

      "abstract": "Recently, many AI researchers and practitioners have embarked on research\nvisions that involve doing AI for \"Good\". This is part of a general drive\ntowards infusing AI research and practice with ethical thinking. One frequent\ntheme in current ethical guidelines is the requirement that AI be good for all,\nor: contribute to the Common Good. But what is the Common Good, and is it\nenough to want to be good? Via four lead questions, I will illustrate\nchallenges and pitfalls when determining, from an AI point of view, what the\nCommon Good is and how it can be enhanced by AI. The questions are: What is the\nproblem / What is a problem?, Who defines the problem?, What is the role of\nknowledge?, and What are important side effects and dynamics? The illustration\nwill use an example from the domain of \"AI for Social Good\", more specifically\n\"Data Science for Social Good\". Even if the importance of these questions may\nbe known at an abstract level, they do not get asked sufficiently in practice,\nas shown by an exploratory study of 99 contributions to recent conferences in\nthe field. Turning these challenges and pitfalls into a positive\nrecommendation, as a conclusion I will draw on another characteristic of\ncomputer-science thinking and practice to make these impediments visible and\nattenuate them: \"attacks\" as a method for improving design. This results in the\nproposal of ethics pen-testing as a method for helping AI designs to better\ncontribute to the Common Good.Comment: to appear in Paladyn.

      "abstract": "The 2023 Policy Papers analyze the impact of AI and automation on marginalized communities in three crucial areas: 1) In  Regulating Facial Recognition Technology to Reduce Bias  Khortlan Becton, JD, MTS, explores the urgent need to regulate AI to eradicate existing and potential policies and practices that dispro-portionately discriminate against African Americans and minorities. Becton proposes the creation of a new federal agency to regulate AI. 2) In  Automation and Artificial Intelligence in the Field of Social Work: Understanding Technology in Practice  Susan Elswick, EdD, LCSW, a faculty member in the University of Memphis School of Social Work, seeks a path to us-ing AI and Automation to provide social work counseling to those in need. Elswick not only explores how effective cli-ent counseling is dependent upon access and ability to use technology by clients but also argues that social workers require formal training from institutions of higher learning on how to use AI and automation to benefit their clients. 3) In  The Impact of Automation on Our Workforce  Meka Egwuekwe, MS, founder and executive director of Code Crew, approaches AI and automation from the per-spective of a practitioner who teaches others to write computer code. Recognizing that the world is experiencing a revolution in how work is performed, Egwuekwe proposes recommendations that reskill or upskill the workforce, increased support for startups and small businesses, and a societal framework that will embrace universal basic income as a resource to aid those displaced by AI and Automation",

Our findings highlight the breadth of sensemaking practices in AI/ML projects, noting developers' efforts to make sense of AI/ML environments (e.g., algorithms/methods and libraries), of AI/ML model ecosystems (e.g., pre-trained models and \"upstream\"models), and of business-AI relations (e.g., how the AI/ML service relates to the domain context and business problem at hand). This paper builds on recent scholarship drawing attention to the integral role of sensemaking in everyday SE practices by empirically investigating how and in what ways AI/ML projects present software teams with emergent sensemaking requirements and opportunities",

      "title": "Full-field and anomaly initialization using a low-order climate model: a comparison and proposals for advanced formulations",
      "abstract": "Initialization techniques for seasonal-to-decadal climate predictions fall into two main categories; namely full-field initialization (FFI) and anomaly initialization (AI). In the FFI case the initial model state is replaced by the best possible available estimate of the real state. By doing so the initial error is efficiently reduced but, due to the unavoidable presence of model deficiencies, once the model is let free to run a prediction, its trajectory drifts away from the observations no matter how small the initial error is. This problem is partly overcome with AI where the aim is to forecast future anomalies by assimilating observed anomalies on an estimate of the model climate.\n\n\n\nThe large variety of experimental setups, models and observational networks adopted worldwide make it difficult to draw firm conclusions on the respective advantages and drawbacks of FFI and AI, or to identify distinctive lines for improvement. The lack of a unified mathematical framework adds an additional difficulty toward the design of adequate initialization strategies that fit the desired forecast horizon, observational network and model at hand.\n\n\n\nHere we compare FFI and AI using a low-order climate model of nine ordinary differential equations and use the notation and concepts of data assimilation theory to highlight their error scaling properties. This analysis suggests better performances using FFI when a good observational network is available and reveals the direct relation of its skill with the observational accuracy. The skill of AI appears, however, mostly related to the model quality and clear increases of skill can only be expected in coincidence with model upgrades.\n\n\n\nWe have compared FFI and AI in experiments in which either the full system or the atmosphere and ocean were independently initialized. In the former case FFI shows better and longer-lasting improvements, with skillful predictions until month 30. In the initialization of single compartments, the best performance is obtained when the stabler component of the model (the ocean) is initialized, but with FFI it is possible to have some predictive skill even when the most unstable compartment (the extratropical atmosphere) is observed.\n\n\n\nTwo advanced formulations, least-square initialization (LSI) and exploring parameter uncertainty (EPU), are introduced. Using LSI the initialization makes use of model statistics to propagate information from observation locations to the entire model domain. Numerical results show that LSI improves the performance of FFI in all the situations when only a portion of the system's state is observed. EPU is an online drift correction method in which the drift caused by the parametric error is estimated using a short-time evolution law and is then removed during the forecast run. Its implementation in conjunction with FFI allows us to improve the prediction skill within the first forecast year.\n\n\n\nFinally, the application of these results in the context of realistic climate models is discussed",

More recently, technological breakthroughs, coupled with the fast availability of data, have brought AI closer to commercial use. Internet giants such as Google, Amazon, Apple or Facebook invest significantly into AI, thereby underlining its relevance for business models worldwide. For the highly data driven finance industry, AI is of intensive interest within pilot projects, still, few AI applications have been implemented so far. This study analyzes drivers and inhibitors of a successful AI application in the finance industry based on panel data comprising 22 semi-structured interviews with experts in AI in finance. As theoretical lens, we structured our results using the TOE framework. Guidelines for applying AI successfully reveal AI-specific role models and process competencies as crucial, before trained algorithms will have reached a quality level on which AI applications will operate without human intervention and moral concerns",

      "abstract": "The 2023 Policy Papers analyze the impact of AI and automation on marginalized communities in three crucial areas: 1) In  Regulating Facial Recognition Technology to Reduce Bias  Khortlan Becton, JD, MTS, explores the urgent need to regulate AI to eradicate existing and potential policies and practices that dispro-portionately discriminate against African Americans and minorities. Becton proposes the creation of a new federal agency to regulate AI. 2) In  Automation and Artificial Intelligence in the Field of Social Work: Understanding Technology in Practice  Susan Elswick, EdD, LCSW, a faculty member in the University of Memphis School of Social Work, seeks a path to us-ing AI and Automation to provide social work counseling to those in need. Elswick not only explores how effective cli-ent counseling is dependent upon access and ability to use technology by clients but also argues that social workers require formal training from institutions of higher learning on how to use AI and automation to benefit their clients. 3) In  The Impact of Automation on Our Workforce  Meka Egwuekwe, MS, founder and executive director of Code Crew, approaches AI and automation from the per-spective of a practitioner who teaches others to write computer code. Recognizing that the world is experiencing a revolution in how work is performed, Egwuekwe proposes recommendations that reskill or upskill the workforce, increased support for startups and small businesses, and a societal framework that will embrace universal basic income as a resource to aid those displaced by AI and Automation",

Our findings highlight the breadth of sensemaking practices in AI/ML projects, noting developers' efforts to make sense of AI/ML environments (e.g., algorithms/methods and libraries), of AI/ML model ecosystems (e.g., pre-trained models and \"upstream\"models), and of business-AI relations (e.g., how the AI/ML service relates to the domain context and business problem at hand). This paper builds on recent scholarship drawing attention to the integral role of sensemaking in everyday SE practices by empirically investigating how and in what ways AI/ML projects present software teams with emergent sensemaking requirements and opportunities",

      "title": "Full-field and anomaly initialization using a low-order climate model: a comparison and proposals for advanced formulations",
      "abstract": "Initialization techniques for seasonal-to-decadal climate predictions fall into two main categories; namely full-field initialization (FFI) and anomaly initialization (AI). In the FFI case the initial model state is replaced by the best possible available estimate of the real state. By doing so the initial error is efficiently reduced but, due to the unavoidable presence of model deficiencies, once the model is let free to run a prediction, its trajectory drifts away from the observations no matter how small the initial error is. This problem is partly overcome with AI where the aim is to forecast future anomalies by assimilating observed anomalies on an estimate of the model climate.\n\n\n\nThe large variety of experimental setups, models and observational networks adopted worldwide make it difficult to draw firm conclusions on the respective advantages and drawbacks of FFI and AI, or to identify distinctive lines for improvement. The lack of a unified mathematical framework adds an additional difficulty toward the design of adequate initialization strategies that fit the desired forecast horizon, observational network and model at hand.\n\n\n\nHere we compare FFI and AI using a low-order climate model of nine ordinary differential equations and use the notation and concepts of data assimilation theory to highlight their error scaling properties. This analysis suggests better performances using FFI when a good observational network is available and reveals the direct relation of its skill with the observational accuracy. The skill of AI appears, however, mostly related to the model quality and clear increases of skill can only be expected in coincidence with model upgrades.\n\n\n\nWe have compared FFI and AI in experiments in which either the full system or the atmosphere and ocean were independently initialized. In the former case FFI shows better and longer-lasting improvements, with skillful predictions until month 30. In the initialization of single compartments, the best performance is obtained when the stabler component of the model (the ocean) is initialized, but with FFI it is possible to have some predictive skill even when the most unstable compartment (the extratropical atmosphere) is observed.\n\n\n\nTwo advanced formulations, least-square initialization (LSI) and exploring parameter uncertainty (EPU), are introduced. Using LSI the initialization makes use of model statistics to propagate information from observation locations to the entire model domain. Numerical results show that LSI improves the performance of FFI in all the situations when only a portion of the system's state is observed. EPU is an online drift correction method in which the drift caused by the parametric error is estimated using a short-time evolution law and is then removed during the forecast run. Its implementation in conjunction with FFI allows us to improve the prediction skill within the first forecast year.\n\n\n\nFinally, the application of these results in the context of realistic climate models is discussed",

      "abstract": "As a research field, artificial intelligence (AI) exists for several years. More recently, technological breakthroughs, coupled with the fast availability of data, have brought AI closer to commercial use. Internet giants such as Google, Amazon, Apple or Facebook invest significantly into AI, thereby underlining its relevance for business models worldwide. For the highly data driven finance industry, AI is of intensive interest within pilot projects, still, few AI applications have been implemented so far. This study analyzes drivers and inhibitors of a successful AI application in the finance industry based on panel data comprising 22 semi-structured interviews with experts in AI in finance. As theoretical lens, we structured our results using the TOE framework. Guidelines for applying AI successfully reveal AI-specific role models and process competencies as crucial, before trained algorithms will have reached a quality level on which AI applications will operate without human intervention and moral concerns",

      "abstract": "The 2023 Policy Papers analyze the impact of AI and automation on marginalized communities in three crucial areas: 1) In  Regulating Facial Recognition Technology to Reduce Bias  Khortlan Becton, JD, MTS, explores the urgent need to regulate AI to eradicate existing and potential policies and practices that dispro-portionately discriminate against African Americans and minorities. Becton proposes the creation of a new federal agency to regulate AI. 2) In  Automation and Artificial Intelligence in the Field of Social Work: Understanding Technology in Practice  Susan Elswick, EdD, LCSW, a faculty member in the University of Memphis School of Social Work, seeks a path to us-ing AI and Automation to provide social work counseling to those in need. Elswick not only explores how effective cli-ent counseling is dependent upon access and ability to use technology by clients but also argues that social workers require formal training from institutions of higher learning on how to use AI and automation to benefit their clients. 3) In  The Impact of Automation on Our Workforce  Meka Egwuekwe, MS, founder and executive director of Code Crew, approaches AI and automation from the per-spective of a practitioner who teaches others to write computer code. Recognizing that the world is experiencing a revolution in how work is performed, Egwuekwe proposes recommendations that reskill or upskill the workforce, increased support for startups and small businesses, and a societal framework that will embrace universal basic income as a resource to aid those displaced by AI and Automation",

      "abstract": "Initialization techniques for seasonal-to-decadal climate predictions fall into two main categories; namely full-field initialization (FFI) and anomaly initialization (AI). In the FFI case the initial model state is replaced by the best possible available estimate of the real state. By doing so the initial error is efficiently reduced but, due to the unavoidable presence of model deficiencies, once the model is let free to run a prediction, its trajectory drifts away from the observations no matter how small the initial error is. This problem is partly overcome with AI where the aim is to forecast future anomalies by assimilating observed anomalies on an estimate of the model climate.\n\n\n\nThe large variety of experimental setups, models and observational networks adopted worldwide make it difficult to draw firm conclusions on the respective advantages and drawbacks of FFI and AI, or to identify distinctive lines for improvement. The lack of a unified mathematical framework adds an additional difficulty toward the design of adequate initialization strategies that fit the desired forecast horizon, observational network and model at hand.\n\n\n\nHere we compare FFI and AI using a low-order climate model of nine ordinary differential equations and use the notation and concepts of data assimilation theory to highlight their error scaling properties. This analysis suggests better performances using FFI when a good observational network is available and reveals the direct relation of its skill with the observational accuracy. The skill of AI appears, however, mostly related to the model quality and clear increases of skill can only be expected in coincidence with model upgrades.\n\n\n\nWe have compared FFI and AI in experiments in which either the full system or the atmosphere and ocean were independently initialized. In the former case FFI shows better and longer-lasting improvements, with skillful predictions until month 30. In the initialization of single compartments, the best performance is obtained when the stabler component of the model (the ocean) is initialized, but with FFI it is possible to have some predictive skill even when the most unstable compartment (the extratropical atmosphere) is observed.\n\n\n\nTwo advanced formulations, least-square initialization (LSI) and exploring parameter uncertainty (EPU), are introduced. Using LSI the initialization makes use of model statistics to propagate information from observation locations to the entire model domain. Numerical results show that LSI improves the performance of FFI in all the situations when only a portion of the system's state is observed. EPU is an online drift correction method in which the drift caused by the parametric error is estimated using a short-time evolution law and is then removed during the forecast run. Its implementation in conjunction with FFI allows us to improve the prediction skill within the first forecast year.\n\n\n\nFinally, the application of these results in the context of realistic climate models is discussed",

More recently, technological breakthroughs, coupled with the fast availability of data, have brought AI closer to commercial use. Internet giants such as Google, Amazon, Apple or Facebook invest significantly into AI, thereby underlining its relevance for business models worldwide. For the highly data driven finance industry, AI is of intensive interest within pilot projects, still, few AI applications have been implemented so far. This study analyzes drivers and inhibitors of a successful AI application in the finance industry based on panel data comprising 22 semi-structured interviews with experts in AI in finance. As theoretical lens, we structured our results using the TOE framework. Guidelines for applying AI successfully reveal AI-specific role models and process competencies as crucial, before trained algorithms will have reached a quality level on which AI applications will operate without human intervention and moral concerns",

      "abstract": "Recently, many AI researchers and practitioners have embarked on research\nvisions that involve doing AI for \"Good\". This is part of a general drive\ntowards infusing AI research and practice with ethical thinking. One frequent\ntheme in current ethical guidelines is the requirement that AI be good for all,\nor: contribute to the Common Good. But what is the Common Good, and is it\nenough to want to be good? Via four lead questions, I will illustrate\nchallenges and pitfalls when determining, from an AI point of view, what the\nCommon Good is and how it can be enhanced by AI. The questions are: What is the\nproblem / What is a problem?, Who defines the problem?, What is the role of\nknowledge?, and What are important side effects and dynamics? The illustration\nwill use an example from the domain of \"AI for Social Good\", more specifically\n\"Data Science for Social Good\". Even if the importance of these questions may\nbe known at an abstract level, they do not get asked sufficiently in practice,\nas shown by an exploratory study of 99 contributions to recent conferences in\nthe field. Turning these challenges and pitfalls into a positive\nrecommendation, as a conclusion I will draw on another characteristic of\ncomputer-science thinking and practice to make these impediments visible and\nattenuate them: \"attacks\" as a method for improving design. This results in the\nproposal of ethics pen-testing as a method for helping AI designs to better\ncontribute to the Common Good.Comment: to appear in Paladyn.

      "abstract": "The 2023 Policy Papers analyze the impact of AI and automation on marginalized communities in three crucial areas: 1) In  Regulating Facial Recognition Technology to Reduce Bias  Khortlan Becton, JD, MTS, explores the urgent need to regulate AI to eradicate existing and potential policies and practices that dispro-portionately discriminate against African Americans and minorities. Becton proposes the creation of a new federal agency to regulate AI. 2) In  Automation and Artificial Intelligence in the Field of Social Work: Understanding Technology in Practice  Susan Elswick, EdD, LCSW, a faculty member in the University of Memphis School of Social Work, seeks a path to us-ing AI and Automation to provide social work counseling to those in need. Elswick not only explores how effective cli-ent counseling is dependent upon access and ability to use technology by clients but also argues that social workers require formal training from institutions of higher learning on how to use AI and automation to benefit their clients. 3) In  The Impact of Automation on Our Workforce  Meka Egwuekwe, MS, founder and executive director of Code Crew, approaches AI and automation from the per-spective of a practitioner who teaches others to write computer code. Recognizing that the world is experiencing a revolution in how work is performed, Egwuekwe proposes recommendations that reskill or upskill the workforce, increased support for startups and small businesses, and a societal framework that will embrace universal basic income as a resource to aid those displaced by AI and Automation",

Our findings highlight the breadth of sensemaking practices in AI/ML projects, noting developers' efforts to make sense of AI/ML environments (e.g., algorithms/methods and libraries), of AI/ML model ecosystems (e.g., pre-trained models and \"upstream\"models), and of business-AI relations (e.g., how the AI/ML service relates to the domain context and business problem at hand). This paper builds on recent scholarship drawing attention to the integral role of sensemaking in everyday SE practices by empirically investigating how and in what ways AI/ML projects present software teams with emergent sensemaking requirements and opportunities",

      "abstract": "Initialization techniques for seasonal-to-decadal climate predictions fall into two main categories; namely full-field initialization (FFI) and anomaly initialization (AI). In the FFI case the initial model state is replaced by the best possible available estimate of the real state. By doing so the initial error is efficiently reduced but, due to the unavoidable presence of model deficiencies, once the model is let free to run a prediction, its trajectory drifts away from the observations no matter how small the initial error is. This problem is partly overcome with AI where the aim is to forecast future anomalies by assimilating observed anomalies on an estimate of the model climate.\n\n\n\nThe large variety of experimental setups, models and observational networks adopted worldwide make it difficult to draw firm conclusions on the respective advantages and drawbacks of FFI and AI, or to identify distinctive lines for improvement. The lack of a unified mathematical framework adds an additional difficulty toward the design of adequate initialization strategies that fit the desired forecast horizon, observational network and model at hand.\n\n\n\nHere we compare FFI and AI using a low-order climate model of nine ordinary differential equations and use the notation and concepts of data assimilation theory to highlight their error scaling properties. This analysis suggests better performances using FFI when a good observational network is available and reveals the direct relation of its skill with the observational accuracy. The skill of AI appears, however, mostly related to the model quality and clear increases of skill can only be expected in coincidence with model upgrades.\n\n\n\nWe have compared FFI and AI in experiments in which either the full system or the atmosphere and ocean were independently initialized. In the former case FFI shows better and longer-lasting improvements, with skillful predictions until month 30. In the initialization of single compartments, the best performance is obtained when the stabler component of the model (the ocean) is initialized, but with FFI it is possible to have some predictive skill even when the most unstable compartment (the extratropical atmosphere) is observed.\n\n\n\nTwo advanced formulations, least-square initialization (LSI) and exploring parameter uncertainty (EPU), are introduced. Using LSI the initialization makes use of model statistics to propagate information from observation locations to the entire model domain. Numerical results show that LSI improves the performance of FFI in all the situations when only a portion of the system's state is observed. EPU is an online drift correction method in which the drift caused by the parametric error is estimated using a short-time evolution law and is then removed during the forecast run. Its implementation in conjunction with FFI allows us to improve the prediction skill within the first forecast year.\n\n\n\nFinally, the application of these results in the context of realistic climate models is discussed",

More recently, technological breakthroughs, coupled with the fast availability of data, have brought AI closer to commercial use. Internet giants such as Google, Amazon, Apple or Facebook invest significantly into AI, thereby underlining its relevance for business models worldwide. For the highly data driven finance industry, AI is of intensive interest within pilot projects, still, few AI applications have been implemented so far. This study analyzes drivers and inhibitors of a successful AI application in the finance industry based on panel data comprising 22 semi-structured interviews with experts in AI in finance. As theoretical lens, we structured our results using the TOE framework. Guidelines for applying AI successfully reveal AI-specific role models and process competencies as crucial, before trained algorithms will have reached a quality level on which AI applications will operate without human intervention and moral concerns",

      "abstract": "Recently, many AI researchers and practitioners have embarked on research\nvisions that involve doing AI for \"Good\". This is part of a general drive\ntowards infusing AI research and practice with ethical thinking. One frequent\ntheme in current ethical guidelines is the requirement that AI be good for all,\nor: contribute to the Common Good. But what is the Common Good, and is it\nenough to want to be good? Via four lead questions, I will illustrate\nchallenges and pitfalls when determining, from an AI point of view, what the\nCommon Good is and how it can be enhanced by AI. The questions are: What is the\nproblem / What is a problem?, Who defines the problem?, What is the role of\nknowledge?, and What are important side effects and dynamics? The illustration\nwill use an example from the domain of \"AI for Social Good\", more specifically\n\"Data Science for Social Good\". Even if the importance of these questions may\nbe known at an abstract level, they do not get asked sufficiently in practice,\nas shown by an exploratory study of 99 contributions to recent conferences in\nthe field. Turning these challenges and pitfalls into a positive\nrecommendation, as a conclusion I will draw on another characteristic of\ncomputer-science thinking and practice to make these impediments visible and\nattenuate them: \"attacks\" as a method for improving design. This results in the\nproposal of ethics pen-testing as a method for helping AI designs to better\ncontribute to the Common Good.Comment: to appear in Paladyn.

But we have not even started asking the right questions, let alone developed an understanding of the consequences. Urgently needed is debate that asks and answers fundamental questions about power. This book brings together critical interrogations of what constitutes AI, its impact and its inequalities in order to offer an analysis of what it means for AI to deliver benefits for everyone. The book is structured in three parts: Part 1, AI: Humans vs. Machines, presents critical perspectives on human-machine dualism. Part 2, Discourses and Myths About AI, excavates metaphors and policies to ask normative questions about what is \u2018desirable\u2019 AI and what conditions make this possible. Part 3, AI Power and Inequalities, discusses how the implementation of AI creates important challenges that urgently need to be addressed. Bringing together scholars from diverse disciplinary backgrounds and regional contexts, this book offers a vital intervention on one of the most hyped concepts of our times",

      "abstract": "The 2023 Policy Papers analyze the impact of AI and automation on marginalized communities in three crucial areas: 1) In  Regulating Facial Recognition Technology to Reduce Bias  Khortlan Becton, JD, MTS, explores the urgent need to regulate AI to eradicate existing and potential policies and practices that dispro-portionately discriminate against African Americans and minorities. Becton proposes the creation of a new federal agency to regulate AI. 2) In  Automation and Artificial Intelligence in the Field of Social Work: Understanding Technology in Practice  Susan Elswick, EdD, LCSW, a faculty member in the University of Memphis School of Social Work, seeks a path to us-ing AI and Automation to provide social work counseling to those in need. Elswick not only explores how effective cli-ent counseling is dependent upon access and ability to use technology by clients but also argues that social workers require formal training from institutions of higher learning on how to use AI and automation to benefit their clients. 3) In  The Impact of Automation on Our Workforce  Meka Egwuekwe, MS, founder and executive director of Code Crew, approaches AI and automation from the per-spective of a practitioner who teaches others to write computer code. Recognizing that the world is experiencing a revolution in how work is performed, Egwuekwe proposes recommendations that reskill or upskill the workforce, increased support for startups and small businesses, and a societal framework that will embrace universal basic income as a resource to aid those displaced by AI and Automation",

      "abstract": "This paper considers sensemaking as it relates to everyday software engineering (SE) work practices and draws on a multi-year ethnographic study of SE projects at a large, global technology company building digital services infused with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) capabilities. Our findings highlight the breadth of sensemaking practices in AI/ML projects, noting developers' efforts to make sense of AI/ML environments (e.g., algorithms/methods and libraries), of AI/ML model ecosystems (e.g., pre-trained models and \"upstream\"models), and of business-AI relations (e.g., how the AI/ML service relates to the domain context and business problem at hand). This paper builds on recent scholarship drawing attention to the integral role of sensemaking in everyday SE practices by empirically investigating how and in what ways AI/ML projects present software teams with emergent sensemaking requirements and opportunities",

      "title": "Full-field and anomaly initialization using a low-order climate model: a comparison and proposals for advanced formulations",
      "abstract": "Initialization techniques for seasonal-to-decadal climate predictions fall into two main categories; namely full-field initialization (FFI) and anomaly initialization (AI). In the FFI case the initial model state is replaced by the best possible available estimate of the real state. By doing so the initial error is efficiently reduced but, due to the unavoidable presence of model deficiencies, once the model is let free to run a prediction, its trajectory drifts away from the observations no matter how small the initial error is. This problem is partly overcome with AI where the aim is to forecast future anomalies by assimilating observed anomalies on an estimate of the model climate.\n\n\n\nThe large variety of experimental setups, models and observational networks adopted worldwide make it difficult to draw firm conclusions on the respective advantages and drawbacks of FFI and AI, or to identify distinctive lines for improvement. The lack of a unified mathematical framework adds an additional difficulty toward the design of adequate initialization strategies that fit the desired forecast horizon, observational network and model at hand.\n\n\n\nHere we compare FFI and AI using a low-order climate model of nine ordinary differential equations and use the notation and concepts of data assimilation theory to highlight their error scaling properties. This analysis suggests better performances using FFI when a good observational network is available and reveals the direct relation of its skill with the observational accuracy. The skill of AI appears, however, mostly related to the model quality and clear increases of skill can only be expected in coincidence with model upgrades.\n\n\n\nWe have compared FFI and AI in experiments in which either the full system or the atmosphere and ocean were independently initialized. In the former case FFI shows better and longer-lasting improvements, with skillful predictions until month 30. In the initialization of single compartments, the best performance is obtained when the stabler component of the model (the ocean) is initialized, but with FFI it is possible to have some predictive skill even when the most unstable compartment (the extratropical atmosphere) is observed.\n\n\n\nTwo advanced formulations, least-square initialization (LSI) and exploring parameter uncertainty (EPU), are introduced. Using LSI the initialization makes use of model statistics to propagate information from observation locations to the entire model domain. Numerical results show that LSI improves the performance of FFI in all the situations when only a portion of the system's state is observed. EPU is an online drift correction method in which the drift caused by the parametric error is estimated using a short-time evolution law and is then removed during the forecast run. Its implementation in conjunction with FFI allows us to improve the prediction skill within the first forecast year.\n\n\n\nFinally, the application of these results in the context of realistic climate models is discussed",
