      "abstract": "The 2010 Milton Wolf Seminar brought together practitioners and academics for three days of exciting debate in Vienna, Austria from March 17 to 19 at the Diplomatic Academy Vienna. Co-sponsored by the American Austrian Foundation, the Center for Global Communication Studies at the University of Pennsylvania\u2018s Annenberg School for Communication, and the Diplomatic Academy Vienna, the seminar explored the theme, \u201cNew media, new newsmakers, new public diplomacy: The changing role of journalists, NGOs, and diplomats in a multi-modal media world.\u201d\nThe PremiseDiscussion began with a recognition that: as new media and communication technologies diffuse worldwide, traditional media institutions face a range of challenges, from shortened news cycles to fragmented and shrinking audiences. Advertising revenues have declined as advertisers try to make sense of the new environment and to redirect their spending in efficient and effective ways, putting media under economic pressure. New technologies create demand for ever-more rapid news provision and non-professional, user-generated content competes directly with the products of traditional news media. In response to these pressures, many news operations have engaged in aggressive downsizing, reducing their staff complements and eliminating foreign bureaus in a bid to contain costs and refocus their operations. These institutions are attempting to adapt to new technologies while retaining their traditional role of supplying accurate and factual news, sorting the important from the irrelevant \u2013 the traditional foundations of their businesses.\nPredictably, under these difficult conditions, the quality of news products suffers. Scott Maier, an associate professor at the University of Oregon detailed the growing problem of inaccuracy in mainstream newspapers. Maier argued that, under the twin pressures of shorter news cycles and smaller newsgathering operations, the quality of news coverage is under threat, an argument echoed by several speakers. Maier\u2018s and others\u2018 research suggests that the problem is broad, applying to both the American and European contexts.\nWhat then, does this changing news landscape mean for journalists, NGOs, and public diplomacy practitioners",

At the moment of switching, the busbars temporarily acts as antennae radiating transient electromagnetic fields within the substations.

      "abstract": "Switching operations of circuit breakers and disconnect switches generate transient currents propagating along the substation busbars. At the moment of switching, the busbars temporarily acts as antennae radiating transient electromagnetic fields within the substations. The radiated fields may interfere and disrupt normal operations of electronic equipment used within the substation for measurement, control and communication purposes. Hence there is the need to fully characterise the substation electromagnetic environment as early as the design stage of substation planning and operation to ensure safe operations of the electronic equipment. This paper deals with the computation of transient electromagnetic fields due to switching within a high voltage air-insulated substation (AIS) using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) metho",

      "abstract": "We present the Limited-range Online Routing Problem (LORP), which involves a\nteam of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with limited communication range that\nmust autonomously coordinate to service task requests. We first show a general\napproach to cast this dynamic problem as a sequence of decentralized task\nallocation problems. Then we present two solutions both based on modeling the\nallocation task as a Markov Random Field to subsequently assess decisions by\nmeans of the decentralized Max-Sum algorithm. Our first solution assumes\nindependence between requests, whereas our second solution also considers the\nUAVs' workloads. A thorough empirical evaluation shows that our workload-based\nsolution consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in a wide\nrange of scenarios, lowering the average service time up to 16%. In the\nbest-case scenario there is no gap between our decentralized solution and\ncentralized techniques. In the worst-case scenario we manage to reduce by 25%\nthe gap between current decentralized and centralized techniques. Thus, our\nsolution becomes the method of choice for our problem",

Hence there is the need to fully characterise the substation electromagnetic environment as early as the design stage of substation planning and operation to ensure safe operations of the electronic equipment. This paper deals with the computation of transient electromagnetic fields due to switching within a high voltage air-insulated substation (AIS) using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) metho",

Of those studies providing clear directional effects, 95% showed a convergence between human effects and system effects (+,+ or -,-),  5% showed a divergence of human and system effects (+,- or -,+).

At the moment of switching, the busbars temporarily acts as antennae radiating transient electromagnetic fields within the substations.

      "abstract": "The 2010 Milton Wolf Seminar brought together practitioners and academics for three days of exciting debate in Vienna, Austria from March 17 to 19 at the Diplomatic Academy Vienna. Co-sponsored by the American Austrian Foundation, the Center for Global Communication Studies at the University of Pennsylvania\u2018s Annenberg School for Communication, and the Diplomatic Academy Vienna, the seminar explored the theme, \u201cNew media, new newsmakers, new public diplomacy: The changing role of journalists, NGOs, and diplomats in a multi-modal media world.\u201d\nThe PremiseDiscussion began with a recognition that: as new media and communication technologies diffuse worldwide, traditional media institutions face a range of challenges, from shortened news cycles to fragmented and shrinking audiences. Advertising revenues have declined as advertisers try to make sense of the new environment and to redirect their spending in efficient and effective ways, putting media under economic pressure. New technologies create demand for ever-more rapid news provision and non-professional, user-generated content competes directly with the products of traditional news media. In response to these pressures, many news operations have engaged in aggressive downsizing, reducing their staff complements and eliminating foreign bureaus in a bid to contain costs and refocus their operations. These institutions are attempting to adapt to new technologies while retaining their traditional role of supplying accurate and factual news, sorting the important from the irrelevant \u2013 the traditional foundations of their businesses.\nPredictably, under these difficult conditions, the quality of news products suffers. Scott Maier, an associate professor at the University of Oregon detailed the growing problem of inaccuracy in mainstream newspapers. Maier argued that, under the twin pressures of shorter news cycles and smaller newsgathering operations, the quality of news coverage is under threat, an argument echoed by several speakers. Maier\u2018s and others\u2018 research suggests that the problem is broad, applying to both the American and European contexts.\nWhat then, does this changing news landscape mean for journalists, NGOs, and public diplomacy practitioners",

Co-sponsored by the American Austrian Foundation, the Center for Global Communication Studies at the University of Pennsylvania\u2018s Annenberg School for Communication, and the Diplomatic Academy Vienna, the seminar explored the theme, \u201cNew media, new newsmakers, new public diplomacy: The changing role of journalists, NGOs, and diplomats in a multi-modal media world.\u201d\nThe PremiseDiscussion began with a recognition that: as new media and communication technologies diffuse worldwide, traditional media institutions face a range of challenges, from shortened news cycles to fragmented and shrinking audiences. Advertising revenues have declined as advertisers try to make sense of the new environment and to redirect their spending in efficient and effective ways, putting media under economic pressure. New technologies create demand for ever-more rapid news provision and non-professional, user-generated content competes directly with the products of traditional news media. In response to these pressures, many news operations have engaged in aggressive downsizing, reducing their staff complements and eliminating foreign bureaus in a bid to contain costs and refocus their operations. These institutions are attempting to adapt to new technologies while retaining their traditional role of supplying accurate and factual news, sorting the important from the irrelevant \u2013 the traditional foundations of their businesses.\nPredictably, under these difficult conditions, the quality of news products suffers. Scott Maier, an associate professor at the University of Oregon detailed the growing problem of inaccuracy in mainstream newspapers. Maier argued that, under the twin pressures of shorter news cycles and smaller newsgathering operations, the quality of news coverage is under threat, an argument echoed by several speakers.

      "abstract": "We present the Limited-range Online Routing Problem (LORP), which involves a\nteam of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with limited communication range that\nmust autonomously coordinate to service task requests. We first show a general\napproach to cast this dynamic problem as a sequence of decentralized task\nallocation problems. Then we present two solutions both based on modeling the\nallocation task as a Markov Random Field to subsequently assess decisions by\nmeans of the decentralized Max-Sum algorithm. Our first solution assumes\nindependence between requests, whereas our second solution also considers the\nUAVs' workloads. A thorough empirical evaluation shows that our workload-based\nsolution consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in a wide\nrange of scenarios, lowering the average service time up to 16%. In the\nbest-case scenario there is no gap between our decentralized solution and\ncentralized techniques. In the worst-case scenario we manage to reduce by 25%\nthe gap between current decentralized and centralized techniques. Thus, our\nsolution becomes the method of choice for our problem",

      "abstract": "We present the Limited-range Online Routing Problem (LORP), which involves a\nteam of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with limited communication range that\nmust autonomously coordinate to service task requests. We first show a general\napproach to cast this dynamic problem as a sequence of decentralized task\nallocation problems. Then we present two solutions both based on modeling the\nallocation task as a Markov Random Field to subsequently assess decisions by\nmeans of the decentralized Max-Sum algorithm. Our first solution assumes\nindependence between requests, whereas our second solution also considers the\nUAVs' workloads. A thorough empirical evaluation shows that our workload-based\nsolution consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in a wide\nrange of scenarios, lowering the average service time up to 16%. In the\nbest-case scenario there is no gap between our decentralized solution and\ncentralized techniques. In the worst-case scenario we manage to reduce by 25%\nthe gap between current decentralized and centralized techniques. Thus, our\nsolution becomes the method of choice for our problem",

      "abstract": "Switching operations of circuit breakers and disconnect switches generate transient currents propagating along the substation busbars. At the moment of switching, the busbars temporarily acts as antennae radiating transient electromagnetic fields within the substations. The radiated fields may interfere and disrupt normal operations of electronic equipment used within the substation for measurement, control and communication purposes. Hence there is the need to fully characterise the substation electromagnetic environment as early as the design stage of substation planning and operation to ensure safe operations of the electronic equipment. This paper deals with the computation of transient electromagnetic fields due to switching within a high voltage air-insulated substation (AIS) using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) metho",

      "abstract": "Switching operations of circuit breakers and disconnect switches generate transient currents propagating along the substation busbars. At the moment of switching, the busbars temporarily acts as antennae radiating transient electromagnetic fields within the substations. The radiated fields may interfere and disrupt normal operations of electronic equipment used within the substation for measurement, control and communication purposes. Hence there is the need to fully characterise the substation electromagnetic environment as early as the design stage of substation planning and operation to ensure safe operations of the electronic equipment. This paper deals with the computation of transient electromagnetic fields due to switching within a high voltage air-insulated substation (AIS) using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) metho",

Co-sponsored by the American Austrian Foundation, the Center for Global Communication Studies at the University of Pennsylvania\u2018s Annenberg School for Communication, and the Diplomatic Academy Vienna, the seminar explored the theme, \u201cNew media, new newsmakers, new public diplomacy: The changing role of journalists, NGOs, and diplomats in a multi-modal media world.\u201d\nThe PremiseDiscussion began with a recognition that: as new media and communication technologies diffuse worldwide, traditional media institutions face a range of challenges, from shortened news cycles to fragmented and shrinking audiences. Advertising revenues have declined as advertisers try to make sense of the new environment and to redirect their spending in efficient and effective ways, putting media under economic pressure. New technologies create demand for ever-more rapid news provision and non-professional, user-generated content competes directly with the products of traditional news media. In response to these pressures, many news operations have engaged in aggressive downsizing, reducing their staff complements and eliminating foreign bureaus in a bid to contain costs and refocus their operations. These institutions are attempting to adapt to new technologies while retaining their traditional role of supplying accurate and factual news, sorting the important from the irrelevant \u2013 the traditional foundations of their businesses.\nPredictably, under these difficult conditions, the quality of news products suffers. Scott Maier, an associate professor at the University of Oregon detailed the growing problem of inaccuracy in mainstream newspapers. Maier argued that, under the twin pressures of shorter news cycles and smaller newsgathering operations, the quality of news coverage is under threat, an argument echoed by several speakers. Maier\u2018s and others\u2018 research suggests that the problem is broad, applying to both the American and European contexts.\nWhat then, does this changing news landscape mean for journalists, NGOs, and public diplomacy practitioners",

The paper offers an methodological interpretation of systemic principles for firms and organisations to close the gap between the general knowledge of social system and the managerial consequences on communication fields. The achievement in the spirit of social system awareness is based on three steps: first, paraphrasing the principles, second, sensitising the observer to the interconnectedness of principles, third, thinking managerial action on the communication field through",

Of those studies providing clear directional effects, 95% showed a convergence between human effects and system effects (+,+ or -,-),  5% showed a divergence of human and system effects (+,- or -,+).  System effects included quality, productivity, implementation performance of new technologies, and also more \u2018intangible\u2019 effects in terms of improved communication and co-operation.

These institutions are attempting to adapt to new technologies while retaining their traditional role of supplying accurate and factual news, sorting the important from the irrelevant \u2013 the traditional foundations of their businesses.\nPredictably, under these difficult conditions, the quality of news products suffers. Scott Maier, an associate professor at the University of Oregon detailed the growing problem of inaccuracy in mainstream newspapers. Maier argued that, under the twin pressures of shorter news cycles and smaller newsgathering operations, the quality of news coverage is under threat, an argument echoed by several speakers. Maier\u2018s and others\u2018 research suggests that the problem is broad, applying to both the American and European contexts.\nWhat then, does this changing news landscape mean for journalists, NGOs, and public diplomacy practitioners",

      "abstract": "The 2010 Milton Wolf Seminar brought together practitioners and academics for three days of exciting debate in Vienna, Austria from March 17 to 19 at the Diplomatic Academy Vienna. Co-sponsored by the American Austrian Foundation, the Center for Global Communication Studies at the University of Pennsylvania\u2018s Annenberg School for Communication, and the Diplomatic Academy Vienna, the seminar explored the theme, \u201cNew media, new newsmakers, new public diplomacy: The changing role of journalists, NGOs, and diplomats in a multi-modal media world.\u201d\nThe PremiseDiscussion began with a recognition that: as new media and communication technologies diffuse worldwide, traditional media institutions face a range of challenges, from shortened news cycles to fragmented and shrinking audiences. Advertising revenues have declined as advertisers try to make sense of the new environment and to redirect their spending in efficient and effective ways, putting media under economic pressure. New technologies create demand for ever-more rapid news provision and non-professional, user-generated content competes directly with the products of traditional news media. In response to these pressures, many news operations have engaged in aggressive downsizing, reducing their staff complements and eliminating foreign bureaus in a bid to contain costs and refocus their operations. These institutions are attempting to adapt to new technologies while retaining their traditional role of supplying accurate and factual news, sorting the important from the irrelevant \u2013 the traditional foundations of their businesses.\nPredictably, under these difficult conditions, the quality of news products suffers. Scott Maier, an associate professor at the University of Oregon detailed the growing problem of inaccuracy in mainstream newspapers. Maier argued that, under the twin pressures of shorter news cycles and smaller newsgathering operations, the quality of news coverage is under threat, an argument echoed by several speakers. Maier\u2018s and others\u2018 research suggests that the problem is broad, applying to both the American and European contexts.\nWhat then, does this changing news landscape mean for journalists, NGOs, and public diplomacy practitioners",

The paper offers an methodological interpretation of systemic principles for firms and organisations to close the gap between the general knowledge of social system and the managerial consequences on communication fields. The achievement in the spirit of social system awareness is based on three steps: first, paraphrasing the principles, second, sensitising the observer to the interconnectedness of principles, third, thinking managerial action on the communication field through",

Of those studies providing clear directional effects, 95% showed a convergence between human effects and system effects (+,+ or -,-),  5% showed a divergence of human and system effects (+,- or -,+).  System effects included quality, productivity, implementation performance of new technologies, and also more \u2018intangible\u2019 effects in terms of improved communication and co-operation.  Human effects included employee health, attitudes, physical workload, and \u2018quality of working life\u2019. \nResearch limitations/im",

      "title": "Time domain analysis of switching transient fields in high voltage substations",
      "abstract": "Switching operations of circuit breakers and disconnect switches generate transient currents propagating along the substation busbars. At the moment of switching, the busbars temporarily acts as antennae radiating transient electromagnetic fields within the substations. The radiated fields may interfere and disrupt normal operations of electronic equipment used within the substation for measurement, control and communication purposes. Hence there is the need to fully characterise the substation electromagnetic environment as early as the design stage of substation planning and operation to ensure safe operations of the electronic equipment. This paper deals with the computation of transient electromagnetic fields due to switching within a high voltage air-insulated substation (AIS) using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) metho",

      "abstract": "We present the Limited-range Online Routing Problem (LORP), which involves a\nteam of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with limited communication range that\nmust autonomously coordinate to service task requests. We first show a general\napproach to cast this dynamic problem as a sequence of decentralized task\nallocation problems. Then we present two solutions both based on modeling the\nallocation task as a Markov Random Field to subsequently assess decisions by\nmeans of the decentralized Max-Sum algorithm. Our first solution assumes\nindependence between requests, whereas our second solution also considers the\nUAVs' workloads. A thorough empirical evaluation shows that our workload-based\nsolution consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in a wide\nrange of scenarios, lowering the average service time up to 16%. In the\nbest-case scenario there is no gap between our decentralized solution and\ncentralized techniques. In the worst-case scenario we manage to reduce by 25%\nthe gap between current decentralized and centralized techniques. Thus, our\nsolution becomes the method of choice for our problem",
