      "abstract": "The transformation of energy networks from passive to active systems requires the embedding of intelligence within the network. One suitable approach to integrating distributed intelligent systems is multi-agent systems technology, where components of functionality run as autonomous agents capable of interaction through messaging. This provides loose coupling between components that can benefit the complex systems envisioned for the smart grid. This paper reviews the key milestones of demonstrated agent systems in the power industry and considers which aspects of agent design must still be addressed for widespread application of agent technology to occur",

      "title": "A Reserve-Based Method for Mitigating the Impact of Renewable Energy",
      "abstract": "The fundamental operating paradigm of today\\u27s power systems is undergoing a significant shift. This is partially motivated by the increased desire for incorporating variable renewable energy resources into generation portfolios. While these generating technologies offer clean energy at zero marginal cost, i.e. no fuel costs, they also offer unique operating challenges for system operators. Perhaps the biggest operating challenge these resources introduce is accommodating their intermittent fuel source availability. For this reason, these generators increase the system-wide variability and uncertainty. As a result, system operators are revisiting traditional operating strategies to more efficiently incorporate these generation resources to maximize the benefit they provide while minimizing the challenges they introduce.\nOne way system operators have accounted for system variability and uncertainty is through the use of operating reserves. Operating reserves can be simplified as excess capacity kept online during real time operations to help accommodate unforeseen fluctuations in demand. With new generation resources, a new class of operating reserves has emerged that is generally known as flexibility, or ramping, reserves. This new reserve class is meant to better position systems to mitigate severe ramping in the net load profile. The best way to define this new requirement is still under investigation. Typical requirement definitions focus on the additional uncertainty introduced by variable generation and there is room for improvement regarding explicit consideration for the variability they introduce. An exogenous reserve modification method is introduced in this report that can improve system reliability with minimal impacts on total system wide production costs.\nAnother potential solution to this problem is to formulate the problem as a stochastic programming problem. The unit commitment and economic dispatch problems are typically formulated as deterministic problems due to fast solution times and the solutions being sufficient for operations. Improvements in technical computing hardware have reignited interest in stochastic modeling. The variability of wind and solar naturally lends itself to stochastic modeling. The use of explicit reserve requirements in stochastic models is an area of interest for power system researchers. This report introduces a new reserve modification implementation based on previous results to be used in a stochastic modeling framework.\nWith technological improvements in distributed generation technologies, microgrids are currently being researched and implemented. Microgrids are small power systems that have the ability to serve their demand with their own generation resources and may have a connection to a larger power system. As battery technologies improve, they are becoming a more viable option in these distributed power systems and research is necessary to determine the most efficient way to utilize them. This report will investigate several unique operating strategies for batteries in small power systems and analyze their benefits. These new operating strategies will help reduce operating costs and improve system reliability",

      "abstract": "Emerging applications in Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems\n(CPS) present novel challenges to Big Data platforms for performing online\nanalytics. Ubiquitous sensors from IoT deployments are able to generate data\nstreams at high velocity, that include information from a variety of domains,\nand accumulate to large volumes on disk. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is\nrecognized as an important real-time computing paradigm for analyzing\ncontinuous data streams. However, existing work on CEP is largely limited to\nrelational query processing, exposing two distinctive gaps for query\nspecification and execution: (1) infusing the relational query model with\nhigher level knowledge semantics, and (2) seamless query evaluation across\ntemporal spaces that span past, present and future events. These allow\naccessible analytics over data streams having properties from different\ndisciplines, and help span the velocity (real-time) and volume (persistent)\ndimensions. In this article, we introduce a Knowledge-infused CEP (X-CEP)\nframework that provides domain-aware knowledge query constructs along with\ntemporal operators that allow end-to-end queries to span across real-time and\npersistent streams. We translate this query model to efficient query execution\nover online and offline data streams, proposing several optimizations to\nmitigate the overheads introduced by evaluating semantic predicates and in\naccessing high-volume historic data streams. The proposed X-CEP query model and\nexecution approaches are implemented in our prototype semantic CEP engine,\nSCEPter. We validate our query model using domain-aware CEP queries from a\nreal-world Smart Power Grid application, and experimentally analyze the\nbenefits of our optimizations for executing these queries, using event streams\nfrom a campus-microgrid IoT deployment.Comment: 34 pages, 16 figures, accepted in Future Generation Computer Systems,\n  October 27, 201",

      "title": "Occupant-Centric Modeling and Control for Low-Carbon and Resilient Communities",
      "abstract": "Global climate change and resulting frequent extreme weather events have highlighted the significance of energy sustainability and resilience. Communities, which refer to a group of buildings located geographically together, are important units for energy generation and consumption. Hence, the research of community energy sustainability and resilience has drawn much attention during the past decades. However, there remain many challenges surrounding community energy modeling and control to achieve the low-carbon and resilient goals.\nFirst, few tools are readily available for community-scale dynamic modeling and control-based studies. To address this gap, a community emulator was developed, which was designed to be hierarchical, scalable, and suitable for various applications. Data-driven stochastic building occupancy prediction was integrated into the emulator using logistic regression methods. Based on this work, we publicly released a library for net-zero energy community modeling using the object-oriented equation-based modeling language Modelica.\nSecond, building load control informed by real-time carbon emission signals is underdeveloped as utility price-driven control has so far been dominant. To better facilitate community energy sustainability through decarbonization, we proposed four rule-based carbon emission responsive building control algorithms to reduce the annual carbon emissions through thermostatically controllable loads. The impact of carbon net-metering, as well as the evolvement of the future energy generation mix, is analyzed on top of both momentary and predictive rules. Based on the simulation results, the average annual household carbon emissions are decreased by 6.0% to 20.5% compared to the baseline. The average annual energy consumption is increased by less than 6.7% due to more clean hours over the year. The annual energy cost change lies between -4.1% and 3.4% on top of the baseline.\nThird, the enhancement of community resilience in an islanded mode through optimal operation strategies is often faced with computational challenges given the large number of controllable loads. To tackle this, we proposed a two-layer model predictive control-based resource allocation and load scheduling framework for community resilience enhancement. Within this framework, the community operator layer optimally allocates the available PV generation to each building, while the building agent layer optimally schedules controllable loads to minimize the unserved load ratio while maintaining thermal comfort. We found that the allocation process is mostly constrained by the building load flexibility. More specifically, buildings with less load flexibility tend to be allocated more PV generation than other buildings. Further, we identified the competitive relationship between the objectives of minimizing unserved load ratio and maximize comfort. Therefore, it is necessary for the building agent to have multi-objective optimization.\nFinally, to account for the uncertainties of occupant behavior and its impact on resilient community load scheduling, we developed a preference-aware scheduler for resilient communities. Stochastic occupant thermostat-changing behavior models were introduced into the deterministic load scheduling framework as a source of uncertainty. KRIs such as the unserved load ratio, the required battery size, and the unmet thermal preference hours were adopted to quantify the impacts. Uncertainties from occupants&rsquo; thermal preferences and their impact on load scheduling are then studied and addressed through chance constraints. Generally, the proposed controller performs better in terms of the unmet thermal preference hours and the battery sizes compared to the deterministic controller.</p",

      "abstract": "The motivation of this work is to present an energy cost reduction concept in a home area power network (HAPN) with intelligent generation and flexible load demands. This study endeavors to address the energy management system (EMS) and layout-design challenges faced by HAPN through a systematic design approach. The growing demand for electricity has become a significant burden on traditional power networks, prompting power engineers to seek ways to improve their efficiency. One such solution is to integrate dispersed generation sources, such as photovoltaic (PV) and storage systems, with an appropriate control mechanism at the distribution level. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in interest in the installation of PV-Battery systems, due to their potential to reduce carbon emissions and lower energy costs. This research proposes an optimal economic power dispatch strategy using Model Predictive Control (MPC) to enhance the overall performance of HAPN. A hybrid AC/DC microgrid concept is proposed to address the control choices made by the appliance scheduling and hybrid switching approaches based on a linear programming optimization framework. The suggested optimization criteria improve consumer satisfaction, minimize grid disconnections, and lower overall energy costs by deploying inexpensive clean energy generation and control. Various examples from actual case study demonstrate the use of the established EMS and design methodology.Die Motivation dieser Arbeit besteht darin, ein Konzept zur Senkung der Energiekosten in einem Heimnetzwerk (HAPN) mit intelligenter Erzeugung und  exiblen Lastanforderungen vorzustellen. Im Rahmen dieser Forschungsarbeit wird ein Entwurf f\u00fcr ein HAPN entwickelt, indem das Energiemanagementsystem (EMS) und der Entwurf des Layouts auf der Grundlage des Systemmodells und der betrieblichen Anforderungen gel\u00f6st werden. Die steigende Nachfrage nach Elektrizit\u00e4t ist f\u00fcr traditionelle Stromnetze kostspielig und infrastrukturintensiv. Daher konzentrieren sich Energietechniker darauf, die Effizienz der derzeitigen Netze zu erh\u00f6hen. Dies kann durch die Integration verteilter Erzeugungsanlagen (z. B. Photovoltaik (PV), Speicher) mit einem geeigneten Kontrollmechanismus f\u00fcr das Energiemanagement auf der Verteilungsseite erreicht werden. Dar\u00fcber hinaus hat das Interesse an der Installation von PV-Batterie-basierten Systemen aufgrund der Reduzierung der CO2-Emissionen und der Senkung der Energiekosten erheblich zugenommen. Es wird eine optimale wirtschaftliche Strategie f\u00fcr den Energieeinsatz unter Verwendung einer modellpr\u00e4diktiven Steuerung (MPC) entwickelt. Es wird zudem ein hybrides AC/DC-Microgrid-Konzept vorgeschlagen, um die Steuerungsentscheidungen, die von den Ans\u00e4tzen der Ger\u00e4teplanung und der hybriden Umschaltung getroffen werden, auf der Grundlage eines linearen Programmierungsoptimierungsrahmens zu ber\u00fccksichtigen. Die vorgeschlagenen Optimierungskriterien verbessern die Zufriedenheit der Verbraucher, minimieren Netzabschaltungen und senken die Gesamtenergiekosten durch den Einsatz von kosteng\u00fcnstiger und sauberer Energieerzeugung. Verschiedene Beispiele aus einer Fallstudie demonstrieren den Einsatz des entwickelten EMS und der Entwurfsmethodik",

      "title": "Market-oriented micro virtual power prosumers operations in distribution system operator framework",
      "abstract": "As the European Union is on track to meet its 2020 energy targets on raising the share of renewable energy and increasing the efficiency in the energy consumption, considerable attention has been given to the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into the restructured distribution system. This thesis  proposes  market-oriented  operations  of  micro  virtual  power  prosumers  (J.lVPPs) in  the distribution system operator framework, in which the J.lVPPs evolve from home-oriented energy management systems to price-taking prosumers  and to price-making prosumers. Considering the diversity of the DERs installed in the residential sector, a configurable J.l VPP is proposed first to deliver multiple energy services using a fuzzy logic-based generic algorithm. By responding to the retail  price  dynamics  and  applying  load  control,  the  J.lVPP   achieves  considerable  electricity  bill savings, active utilisation of energy storage system and fast return on investment. As the J.lVPPs enter the distribution system market, they are modelled as price-takers in a two-settlement market first and a chance-constrained formulation is proposed to derive the bidding strategies. The obtained strategy demonstrates its ability to bring the J.l VPP maximum profit based on different composition of DERs and to maintain adequate supply capacity to meet the demand considering the volatile renewable generation and load forecast. Given the non-cooperative nature of the actual market, the J.l VPPs are transformed into price-makers and their market behaviours are studied in the context of electricity market equilibrium models. The resulted equilibrium problems with equilibrium constraints (EPEC) are presented and solved using a novel application of coevolutionary approach. Compared with the roles of home-oriented energy management systems and price-taking prosumers, the J.lVPPs as price\u00ad making prosumers have an improved utilisation rate of the installed DER capacity and a guaranteed profit from participating in the distribution system market",

      "abstract": "As the European Union is on track to meet its 2020 energy targets on raising the share of renewable energy and increasing the efficiency in the energy consumption, considerable attention has been given to the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into the restructured distribution system. This thesis  proposes  market-oriented  operations  of  micro  virtual  power  prosumers  (J.lVPPs) in  the distribution system operator framework, in which the J.lVPPs evolve from home-oriented energy management systems to price-taking prosumers  and to price-making prosumers. Considering the diversity of the DERs installed in the residential sector, a configurable J.l VPP is proposed first to deliver multiple energy services using a fuzzy logic-based generic algorithm. By responding to the retail  price  dynamics  and  applying  load  control,  the  J.lVPP   achieves  considerable  electricity  bill savings, active utilisation of energy storage system and fast return on investment. As the J.lVPPs enter the distribution system market, they are modelled as price-takers in a two-settlement market first and a chance-constrained formulation is proposed to derive the bidding strategies. The obtained strategy demonstrates its ability to bring the J.l VPP maximum profit based on different composition of DERs and to maintain adequate supply capacity to meet the demand considering the volatile renewable generation and load forecast. Given the non-cooperative nature of the actual market, the J.l VPPs are transformed into price-makers and their market behaviours are studied in the context of electricity market equilibrium models. The resulted equilibrium problems with equilibrium constraints (EPEC) are presented and solved using a novel application of coevolutionary approach. Compared with the roles of home-oriented energy management systems and price-taking prosumers, the J.lVPPs as price\u00ad making prosumers have an improved utilisation rate of the installed DER capacity and a guaranteed profit from participating in the distribution system market",

      "title": "A Reserve-Based Method for Mitigating the Impact of Renewable Energy",
      "abstract": "The fundamental operating paradigm of today\\u27s power systems is undergoing a significant shift. This is partially motivated by the increased desire for incorporating variable renewable energy resources into generation portfolios. While these generating technologies offer clean energy at zero marginal cost, i.e. no fuel costs, they also offer unique operating challenges for system operators. Perhaps the biggest operating challenge these resources introduce is accommodating their intermittent fuel source availability. For this reason, these generators increase the system-wide variability and uncertainty. As a result, system operators are revisiting traditional operating strategies to more efficiently incorporate these generation resources to maximize the benefit they provide while minimizing the challenges they introduce.\nOne way system operators have accounted for system variability and uncertainty is through the use of operating reserves. Operating reserves can be simplified as excess capacity kept online during real time operations to help accommodate unforeseen fluctuations in demand. With new generation resources, a new class of operating reserves has emerged that is generally known as flexibility, or ramping, reserves. This new reserve class is meant to better position systems to mitigate severe ramping in the net load profile. The best way to define this new requirement is still under investigation. Typical requirement definitions focus on the additional uncertainty introduced by variable generation and there is room for improvement regarding explicit consideration for the variability they introduce. An exogenous reserve modification method is introduced in this report that can improve system reliability with minimal impacts on total system wide production costs.\nAnother potential solution to this problem is to formulate the problem as a stochastic programming problem. The unit commitment and economic dispatch problems are typically formulated as deterministic problems due to fast solution times and the solutions being sufficient for operations. Improvements in technical computing hardware have reignited interest in stochastic modeling. The variability of wind and solar naturally lends itself to stochastic modeling. The use of explicit reserve requirements in stochastic models is an area of interest for power system researchers. This report introduces a new reserve modification implementation based on previous results to be used in a stochastic modeling framework.\nWith technological improvements in distributed generation technologies, microgrids are currently being researched and implemented. Microgrids are small power systems that have the ability to serve their demand with their own generation resources and may have a connection to a larger power system. As battery technologies improve, they are becoming a more viable option in these distributed power systems and research is necessary to determine the most efficient way to utilize them. This report will investigate several unique operating strategies for batteries in small power systems and analyze their benefits. These new operating strategies will help reduce operating costs and improve system reliability",

      "abstract": "Emerging applications in Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems\n(CPS) present novel challenges to Big Data platforms for performing online\nanalytics. Ubiquitous sensors from IoT deployments are able to generate data\nstreams at high velocity, that include information from a variety of domains,\nand accumulate to large volumes on disk. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is\nrecognized as an important real-time computing paradigm for analyzing\ncontinuous data streams. However, existing work on CEP is largely limited to\nrelational query processing, exposing two distinctive gaps for query\nspecification and execution: (1) infusing the relational query model with\nhigher level knowledge semantics, and (2) seamless query evaluation across\ntemporal spaces that span past, present and future events. These allow\naccessible analytics over data streams having properties from different\ndisciplines, and help span the velocity (real-time) and volume (persistent)\ndimensions. In this article, we introduce a Knowledge-infused CEP (X-CEP)\nframework that provides domain-aware knowledge query constructs along with\ntemporal operators that allow end-to-end queries to span across real-time and\npersistent streams. We translate this query model to efficient query execution\nover online and offline data streams, proposing several optimizations to\nmitigate the overheads introduced by evaluating semantic predicates and in\naccessing high-volume historic data streams. The proposed X-CEP query model and\nexecution approaches are implemented in our prototype semantic CEP engine,\nSCEPter. We validate our query model using domain-aware CEP queries from a\nreal-world Smart Power Grid application, and experimentally analyze the\nbenefits of our optimizations for executing these queries, using event streams\nfrom a campus-microgrid IoT deployment.Comment: 34 pages, 16 figures, accepted in Future Generation Computer Systems,\n  October 27, 201",

      "title": "Occupant-Centric Modeling and Control for Low-Carbon and Resilient Communities",
      "abstract": "Global climate change and resulting frequent extreme weather events have highlighted the significance of energy sustainability and resilience. Communities, which refer to a group of buildings located geographically together, are important units for energy generation and consumption. Hence, the research of community energy sustainability and resilience has drawn much attention during the past decades. However, there remain many challenges surrounding community energy modeling and control to achieve the low-carbon and resilient goals.\nFirst, few tools are readily available for community-scale dynamic modeling and control-based studies. To address this gap, a community emulator was developed, which was designed to be hierarchical, scalable, and suitable for various applications. Data-driven stochastic building occupancy prediction was integrated into the emulator using logistic regression methods. Based on this work, we publicly released a library for net-zero energy community modeling using the object-oriented equation-based modeling language Modelica.\nSecond, building load control informed by real-time carbon emission signals is underdeveloped as utility price-driven control has so far been dominant. To better facilitate community energy sustainability through decarbonization, we proposed four rule-based carbon emission responsive building control algorithms to reduce the annual carbon emissions through thermostatically controllable loads. The impact of carbon net-metering, as well as the evolvement of the future energy generation mix, is analyzed on top of both momentary and predictive rules. Based on the simulation results, the average annual household carbon emissions are decreased by 6.0% to 20.5% compared to the baseline. The average annual energy consumption is increased by less than 6.7% due to more clean hours over the year. The annual energy cost change lies between -4.1% and 3.4% on top of the baseline.\nThird, the enhancement of community resilience in an islanded mode through optimal operation strategies is often faced with computational challenges given the large number of controllable loads. To tackle this, we proposed a two-layer model predictive control-based resource allocation and load scheduling framework for community resilience enhancement. Within this framework, the community operator layer optimally allocates the available PV generation to each building, while the building agent layer optimally schedules controllable loads to minimize the unserved load ratio while maintaining thermal comfort. We found that the allocation process is mostly constrained by the building load flexibility. More specifically, buildings with less load flexibility tend to be allocated more PV generation than other buildings. Further, we identified the competitive relationship between the objectives of minimizing unserved load ratio and maximize comfort. Therefore, it is necessary for the building agent to have multi-objective optimization.\nFinally, to account for the uncertainties of occupant behavior and its impact on resilient community load scheduling, we developed a preference-aware scheduler for resilient communities. Stochastic occupant thermostat-changing behavior models were introduced into the deterministic load scheduling framework as a source of uncertainty. KRIs such as the unserved load ratio, the required battery size, and the unmet thermal preference hours were adopted to quantify the impacts. Uncertainties from occupants&rsquo; thermal preferences and their impact on load scheduling are then studied and addressed through chance constraints. Generally, the proposed controller performs better in terms of the unmet thermal preference hours and the battery sizes compared to the deterministic controller.</p",

      "abstract": "The motivation of this work is to present an energy cost reduction concept in a home area power network (HAPN) with intelligent generation and flexible load demands. This study endeavors to address the energy management system (EMS) and layout-design challenges faced by HAPN through a systematic design approach. The growing demand for electricity has become a significant burden on traditional power networks, prompting power engineers to seek ways to improve their efficiency. One such solution is to integrate dispersed generation sources, such as photovoltaic (PV) and storage systems, with an appropriate control mechanism at the distribution level. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in interest in the installation of PV-Battery systems, due to their potential to reduce carbon emissions and lower energy costs. This research proposes an optimal economic power dispatch strategy using Model Predictive Control (MPC) to enhance the overall performance of HAPN. A hybrid AC/DC microgrid concept is proposed to address the control choices made by the appliance scheduling and hybrid switching approaches based on a linear programming optimization framework. The suggested optimization criteria improve consumer satisfaction, minimize grid disconnections, and lower overall energy costs by deploying inexpensive clean energy generation and control. Various examples from actual case study demonstrate the use of the established EMS and design methodology.Die Motivation dieser Arbeit besteht darin, ein Konzept zur Senkung der Energiekosten in einem Heimnetzwerk (HAPN) mit intelligenter Erzeugung und  exiblen Lastanforderungen vorzustellen. Im Rahmen dieser Forschungsarbeit wird ein Entwurf f\u00fcr ein HAPN entwickelt, indem das Energiemanagementsystem (EMS) und der Entwurf des Layouts auf der Grundlage des Systemmodells und der betrieblichen Anforderungen gel\u00f6st werden. Die steigende Nachfrage nach Elektrizit\u00e4t ist f\u00fcr traditionelle Stromnetze kostspielig und infrastrukturintensiv. Daher konzentrieren sich Energietechniker darauf, die Effizienz der derzeitigen Netze zu erh\u00f6hen. Dies kann durch die Integration verteilter Erzeugungsanlagen (z. B. Photovoltaik (PV), Speicher) mit einem geeigneten Kontrollmechanismus f\u00fcr das Energiemanagement auf der Verteilungsseite erreicht werden. Dar\u00fcber hinaus hat das Interesse an der Installation von PV-Batterie-basierten Systemen aufgrund der Reduzierung der CO2-Emissionen und der Senkung der Energiekosten erheblich zugenommen. Es wird eine optimale wirtschaftliche Strategie f\u00fcr den Energieeinsatz unter Verwendung einer modellpr\u00e4diktiven Steuerung (MPC) entwickelt.

      "title": "A Reserve-Based Method for Mitigating the Impact of Renewable Energy",
      "abstract": "The fundamental operating paradigm of today\\u27s power systems is undergoing a significant shift. This is partially motivated by the increased desire for incorporating variable renewable energy resources into generation portfolios. While these generating technologies offer clean energy at zero marginal cost, i.e. no fuel costs, they also offer unique operating challenges for system operators. Perhaps the biggest operating challenge these resources introduce is accommodating their intermittent fuel source availability. For this reason, these generators increase the system-wide variability and uncertainty. As a result, system operators are revisiting traditional operating strategies to more efficiently incorporate these generation resources to maximize the benefit they provide while minimizing the challenges they introduce.\nOne way system operators have accounted for system variability and uncertainty is through the use of operating reserves. Operating reserves can be simplified as excess capacity kept online during real time operations to help accommodate unforeseen fluctuations in demand. With new generation resources, a new class of operating reserves has emerged that is generally known as flexibility, or ramping, reserves. This new reserve class is meant to better position systems to mitigate severe ramping in the net load profile. The best way to define this new requirement is still under investigation. Typical requirement definitions focus on the additional uncertainty introduced by variable generation and there is room for improvement regarding explicit consideration for the variability they introduce. An exogenous reserve modification method is introduced in this report that can improve system reliability with minimal impacts on total system wide production costs.\nAnother potential solution to this problem is to formulate the problem as a stochastic programming problem. The unit commitment and economic dispatch problems are typically formulated as deterministic problems due to fast solution times and the solutions being sufficient for operations. Improvements in technical computing hardware have reignited interest in stochastic modeling. The variability of wind and solar naturally lends itself to stochastic modeling. The use of explicit reserve requirements in stochastic models is an area of interest for power system researchers. This report introduces a new reserve modification implementation based on previous results to be used in a stochastic modeling framework.\nWith technological improvements in distributed generation technologies, microgrids are currently being researched and implemented. Microgrids are small power systems that have the ability to serve their demand with their own generation resources and may have a connection to a larger power system. As battery technologies improve, they are becoming a more viable option in these distributed power systems and research is necessary to determine the most efficient way to utilize them. This report will investigate several unique operating strategies for batteries in small power systems and analyze their benefits. These new operating strategies will help reduce operating costs and improve system reliability",

      "abstract": "Emerging applications in Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems\n(CPS) present novel challenges to Big Data platforms for performing online\nanalytics. Ubiquitous sensors from IoT deployments are able to generate data\nstreams at high velocity, that include information from a variety of domains,\nand accumulate to large volumes on disk. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is\nrecognized as an important real-time computing paradigm for analyzing\ncontinuous data streams. However, existing work on CEP is largely limited to\nrelational query processing, exposing two distinctive gaps for query\nspecification and execution: (1) infusing the relational query model with\nhigher level knowledge semantics, and (2) seamless query evaluation across\ntemporal spaces that span past, present and future events. These allow\naccessible analytics over data streams having properties from different\ndisciplines, and help span the velocity (real-time) and volume (persistent)\ndimensions. In this article, we introduce a Knowledge-infused CEP (X-CEP)\nframework that provides domain-aware knowledge query constructs along with\ntemporal operators that allow end-to-end queries to span across real-time and\npersistent streams. We translate this query model to efficient query execution\nover online and offline data streams, proposing several optimizations to\nmitigate the overheads introduced by evaluating semantic predicates and in\naccessing high-volume historic data streams. The proposed X-CEP query model and\nexecution approaches are implemented in our prototype semantic CEP engine,\nSCEPter. We validate our query model using domain-aware CEP queries from a\nreal-world Smart Power Grid application, and experimentally analyze the\nbenefits of our optimizations for executing these queries, using event streams\nfrom a campus-microgrid IoT deployment.Comment: 34 pages, 16 figures, accepted in Future Generation Computer Systems,\n  October 27, 201",

      "title": "Occupant-Centric Modeling and Control for Low-Carbon and Resilient Communities",
      "abstract": "Global climate change and resulting frequent extreme weather events have highlighted the significance of energy sustainability and resilience. Communities, which refer to a group of buildings located geographically together, are important units for energy generation and consumption. Hence, the research of community energy sustainability and resilience has drawn much attention during the past decades. However, there remain many challenges surrounding community energy modeling and control to achieve the low-carbon and resilient goals.\nFirst, few tools are readily available for community-scale dynamic modeling and control-based studies. To address this gap, a community emulator was developed, which was designed to be hierarchical, scalable, and suitable for various applications. Data-driven stochastic building occupancy prediction was integrated into the emulator using logistic regression methods. Based on this work, we publicly released a library for net-zero energy community modeling using the object-oriented equation-based modeling language Modelica.\nSecond, building load control informed by real-time carbon emission signals is underdeveloped as utility price-driven control has so far been dominant. To better facilitate community energy sustainability through decarbonization, we proposed four rule-based carbon emission responsive building control algorithms to reduce the annual carbon emissions through thermostatically controllable loads. The impact of carbon net-metering, as well as the evolvement of the future energy generation mix, is analyzed on top of both momentary and predictive rules. Based on the simulation results, the average annual household carbon emissions are decreased by 6.0% to 20.5% compared to the baseline. The average annual energy consumption is increased by less than 6.7% due to more clean hours over the year. The annual energy cost change lies between -4.1% and 3.4% on top of the baseline.\nThird, the enhancement of community resilience in an islanded mode through optimal operation strategies is often faced with computational challenges given the large number of controllable loads. To tackle this, we proposed a two-layer model predictive control-based resource allocation and load scheduling framework for community resilience enhancement. Within this framework, the community operator layer optimally allocates the available PV generation to each building, while the building agent layer optimally schedules controllable loads to minimize the unserved load ratio while maintaining thermal comfort. We found that the allocation process is mostly constrained by the building load flexibility. More specifically, buildings with less load flexibility tend to be allocated more PV generation than other buildings. Further, we identified the competitive relationship between the objectives of minimizing unserved load ratio and maximize comfort. Therefore, it is necessary for the building agent to have multi-objective optimization.\nFinally, to account for the uncertainties of occupant behavior and its impact on resilient community load scheduling, we developed a preference-aware scheduler for resilient communities. Stochastic occupant thermostat-changing behavior models were introduced into the deterministic load scheduling framework as a source of uncertainty. KRIs such as the unserved load ratio, the required battery size, and the unmet thermal preference hours were adopted to quantify the impacts. Uncertainties from occupants&rsquo; thermal preferences and their impact on load scheduling are then studied and addressed through chance constraints. Generally, the proposed controller performs better in terms of the unmet thermal preference hours and the battery sizes compared to the deterministic controller.</p",

      "abstract": "The motivation of this work is to present an energy cost reduction concept in a home area power network (HAPN) with intelligent generation and flexible load demands. This study endeavors to address the energy management system (EMS) and layout-design challenges faced by HAPN through a systematic design approach. The growing demand for electricity has become a significant burden on traditional power networks, prompting power engineers to seek ways to improve their efficiency. One such solution is to integrate dispersed generation sources, such as photovoltaic (PV) and storage systems, with an appropriate control mechanism at the distribution level. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in interest in the installation of PV-Battery systems, due to their potential to reduce carbon emissions and lower energy costs. This research proposes an optimal economic power dispatch strategy using Model Predictive Control (MPC) to enhance the overall performance of HAPN. A hybrid AC/DC microgrid concept is proposed to address the control choices made by the appliance scheduling and hybrid switching approaches based on a linear programming optimization framework. The suggested optimization criteria improve consumer satisfaction, minimize grid disconnections, and lower overall energy costs by deploying inexpensive clean energy generation and control. Various examples from actual case study demonstrate the use of the established EMS and design methodology.Die Motivation dieser Arbeit besteht darin, ein Konzept zur Senkung der Energiekosten in einem Heimnetzwerk (HAPN) mit intelligenter Erzeugung und  exiblen Lastanforderungen vorzustellen. Im Rahmen dieser Forschungsarbeit wird ein Entwurf f\u00fcr ein HAPN entwickelt, indem das Energiemanagementsystem (EMS) und der Entwurf des Layouts auf der Grundlage des Systemmodells und der betrieblichen Anforderungen gel\u00f6st werden. Die steigende Nachfrage nach Elektrizit\u00e4t ist f\u00fcr traditionelle Stromnetze kostspielig und infrastrukturintensiv. Daher konzentrieren sich Energietechniker darauf, die Effizienz der derzeitigen Netze zu erh\u00f6hen. Dies kann durch die Integration verteilter Erzeugungsanlagen (z. B. Photovoltaik (PV), Speicher) mit einem geeigneten Kontrollmechanismus f\u00fcr das Energiemanagement auf der Verteilungsseite erreicht werden. Dar\u00fcber hinaus hat das Interesse an der Installation von PV-Batterie-basierten Systemen aufgrund der Reduzierung der CO2-Emissionen und der Senkung der Energiekosten erheblich zugenommen. Es wird eine optimale wirtschaftliche Strategie f\u00fcr den Energieeinsatz unter Verwendung einer modellpr\u00e4diktiven Steuerung (MPC) entwickelt. Es wird zudem ein hybrides AC/DC-Microgrid-Konzept vorgeschlagen, um die Steuerungsentscheidungen, die von den Ans\u00e4tzen der Ger\u00e4teplanung und der hybriden Umschaltung getroffen werden, auf der Grundlage eines linearen Programmierungsoptimierungsrahmens zu ber\u00fccksichtigen. Die vorgeschlagenen Optimierungskriterien verbessern die Zufriedenheit der Verbraucher, minimieren Netzabschaltungen und senken die Gesamtenergiekosten durch den Einsatz von kosteng\u00fcnstiger und sauberer Energieerzeugung. Verschiedene Beispiele aus einer Fallstudie demonstrieren den Einsatz des entwickelten EMS und der Entwurfsmethodik",

      "title": "A Reserve-Based Method for Mitigating the Impact of Renewable Energy",
      "abstract": "The fundamental operating paradigm of today\\u27s power systems is undergoing a significant shift. This is partially motivated by the increased desire for incorporating variable renewable energy resources into generation portfolios. While these generating technologies offer clean energy at zero marginal cost, i.e. no fuel costs, they also offer unique operating challenges for system operators. Perhaps the biggest operating challenge these resources introduce is accommodating their intermittent fuel source availability. For this reason, these generators increase the system-wide variability and uncertainty. As a result, system operators are revisiting traditional operating strategies to more efficiently incorporate these generation resources to maximize the benefit they provide while minimizing the challenges they introduce.\nOne way system operators have accounted for system variability and uncertainty is through the use of operating reserves. Operating reserves can be simplified as excess capacity kept online during real time operations to help accommodate unforeseen fluctuations in demand. With new generation resources, a new class of operating reserves has emerged that is generally known as flexibility, or ramping, reserves. This new reserve class is meant to better position systems to mitigate severe ramping in the net load profile. The best way to define this new requirement is still under investigation. Typical requirement definitions focus on the additional uncertainty introduced by variable generation and there is room for improvement regarding explicit consideration for the variability they introduce. An exogenous reserve modification method is introduced in this report that can improve system reliability with minimal impacts on total system wide production costs.\nAnother potential solution to this problem is to formulate the problem as a stochastic programming problem. The unit commitment and economic dispatch problems are typically formulated as deterministic problems due to fast solution times and the solutions being sufficient for operations. Improvements in technical computing hardware have reignited interest in stochastic modeling. The variability of wind and solar naturally lends itself to stochastic modeling. The use of explicit reserve requirements in stochastic models is an area of interest for power system researchers. This report introduces a new reserve modification implementation based on previous results to be used in a stochastic modeling framework.\nWith technological improvements in distributed generation technologies, microgrids are currently being researched and implemented. Microgrids are small power systems that have the ability to serve their demand with their own generation resources and may have a connection to a larger power system. As battery technologies improve, they are becoming a more viable option in these distributed power systems and research is necessary to determine the most efficient way to utilize them. This report will investigate several unique operating strategies for batteries in small power systems and analyze their benefits. These new operating strategies will help reduce operating costs and improve system reliability",

      "abstract": "Emerging applications in Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems\n(CPS) present novel challenges to Big Data platforms for performing online\nanalytics. Ubiquitous sensors from IoT deployments are able to generate data\nstreams at high velocity, that include information from a variety of domains,\nand accumulate to large volumes on disk. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is\nrecognized as an important real-time computing paradigm for analyzing\ncontinuous data streams. However, existing work on CEP is largely limited to\nrelational query processing, exposing two distinctive gaps for query\nspecification and execution: (1) infusing the relational query model with\nhigher level knowledge semantics, and (2) seamless query evaluation across\ntemporal spaces that span past, present and future events. These allow\naccessible analytics over data streams having properties from different\ndisciplines, and help span the velocity (real-time) and volume (persistent)\ndimensions. In this article, we introduce a Knowledge-infused CEP (X-CEP)\nframework that provides domain-aware knowledge query constructs along with\ntemporal operators that allow end-to-end queries to span across real-time and\npersistent streams. We translate this query model to efficient query execution\nover online and offline data streams, proposing several optimizations to\nmitigate the overheads introduced by evaluating semantic predicates and in\naccessing high-volume historic data streams. The proposed X-CEP query model and\nexecution approaches are implemented in our prototype semantic CEP engine,\nSCEPter. We validate our query model using domain-aware CEP queries from a\nreal-world Smart Power Grid application, and experimentally analyze the\nbenefits of our optimizations for executing these queries, using event streams\nfrom a campus-microgrid IoT deployment.Comment: 34 pages, 16 figures, accepted in Future Generation Computer Systems,\n  October 27, 201",

      "title": "Occupant-Centric Modeling and Control for Low-Carbon and Resilient Communities",
      "abstract": "Global climate change and resulting frequent extreme weather events have highlighted the significance of energy sustainability and resilience. Communities, which refer to a group of buildings located geographically together, are important units for energy generation and consumption. Hence, the research of community energy sustainability and resilience has drawn much attention during the past decades. However, there remain many challenges surrounding community energy modeling and control to achieve the low-carbon and resilient goals.\nFirst, few tools are readily available for community-scale dynamic modeling and control-based studies. To address this gap, a community emulator was developed, which was designed to be hierarchical, scalable, and suitable for various applications. Data-driven stochastic building occupancy prediction was integrated into the emulator using logistic regression methods. Based on this work, we publicly released a library for net-zero energy community modeling using the object-oriented equation-based modeling language Modelica.\nSecond, building load control informed by real-time carbon emission signals is underdeveloped as utility price-driven control has so far been dominant. To better facilitate community energy sustainability through decarbonization, we proposed four rule-based carbon emission responsive building control algorithms to reduce the annual carbon emissions through thermostatically controllable loads. The impact of carbon net-metering, as well as the evolvement of the future energy generation mix, is analyzed on top of both momentary and predictive rules. Based on the simulation results, the average annual household carbon emissions are decreased by 6.0% to 20.5% compared to the baseline. The average annual energy consumption is increased by less than 6.7% due to more clean hours over the year. The annual energy cost change lies between -4.1% and 3.4% on top of the baseline.\nThird, the enhancement of community resilience in an islanded mode through optimal operation strategies is often faced with computational challenges given the large number of controllable loads. To tackle this, we proposed a two-layer model predictive control-based resource allocation and load scheduling framework for community resilience enhancement. Within this framework, the community operator layer optimally allocates the available PV generation to each building, while the building agent layer optimally schedules controllable loads to minimize the unserved load ratio while maintaining thermal comfort. We found that the allocation process is mostly constrained by the building load flexibility. More specifically, buildings with less load flexibility tend to be allocated more PV generation than other buildings. Further, we identified the competitive relationship between the objectives of minimizing unserved load ratio and maximize comfort. Therefore, it is necessary for the building agent to have multi-objective optimization.\nFinally, to account for the uncertainties of occupant behavior and its impact on resilient community load scheduling, we developed a preference-aware scheduler for resilient communities. Stochastic occupant thermostat-changing behavior models were introduced into the deterministic load scheduling framework as a source of uncertainty. KRIs such as the unserved load ratio, the required battery size, and the unmet thermal preference hours were adopted to quantify the impacts. Uncertainties from occupants&rsquo; thermal preferences and their impact on load scheduling are then studied and addressed through chance constraints. Generally, the proposed controller performs better in terms of the unmet thermal preference hours and the battery sizes compared to the deterministic controller.</p",

      "abstract": "The motivation of this work is to present an energy cost reduction concept in a home area power network (HAPN) with intelligent generation and flexible load demands. This study endeavors to address the energy management system (EMS) and layout-design challenges faced by HAPN through a systematic design approach. The growing demand for electricity has become a significant burden on traditional power networks, prompting power engineers to seek ways to improve their efficiency. One such solution is to integrate dispersed generation sources, such as photovoltaic (PV) and storage systems, with an appropriate control mechanism at the distribution level. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in interest in the installation of PV-Battery systems, due to their potential to reduce carbon emissions and lower energy costs. This research proposes an optimal economic power dispatch strategy using Model Predictive Control (MPC) to enhance the overall performance of HAPN. A hybrid AC/DC microgrid concept is proposed to address the control choices made by the appliance scheduling and hybrid switching approaches based on a linear programming optimization framework. The suggested optimization criteria improve consumer satisfaction, minimize grid disconnections, and lower overall energy costs by deploying inexpensive clean energy generation and control. Various examples from actual case study demonstrate the use of the established EMS and design methodology.Die Motivation dieser Arbeit besteht darin, ein Konzept zur Senkung der Energiekosten in einem Heimnetzwerk (HAPN) mit intelligenter Erzeugung und  exiblen Lastanforderungen vorzustellen. Im Rahmen dieser Forschungsarbeit wird ein Entwurf f\u00fcr ein HAPN entwickelt, indem das Energiemanagementsystem (EMS) und der Entwurf des Layouts auf der Grundlage des Systemmodells und der betrieblichen Anforderungen gel\u00f6st werden. Die steigende Nachfrage nach Elektrizit\u00e4t ist f\u00fcr traditionelle Stromnetze kostspielig und infrastrukturintensiv. Daher konzentrieren sich Energietechniker darauf, die Effizienz der derzeitigen Netze zu erh\u00f6hen. Dies kann durch die Integration verteilter Erzeugungsanlagen (z. B. Photovoltaik (PV), Speicher) mit einem geeigneten Kontrollmechanismus f\u00fcr das Energiemanagement auf der Verteilungsseite erreicht werden. Dar\u00fcber hinaus hat das Interesse an der Installation von PV-Batterie-basierten Systemen aufgrund der Reduzierung der CO2-Emissionen und der Senkung der Energiekosten erheblich zugenommen. Es wird eine optimale wirtschaftliche Strategie f\u00fcr den Energieeinsatz unter Verwendung einer modellpr\u00e4diktiven Steuerung (MPC) entwickelt. Es wird zudem ein hybrides AC/DC-Microgrid-Konzept vorgeschlagen, um die Steuerungsentscheidungen, die von den Ans\u00e4tzen der Ger\u00e4teplanung und der hybriden Umschaltung getroffen werden, auf der Grundlage eines linearen Programmierungsoptimierungsrahmens zu ber\u00fccksichtigen. Die vorgeschlagenen Optimierungskriterien verbessern die Zufriedenheit der Verbraucher, minimieren Netzabschaltungen und senken die Gesamtenergiekosten durch den Einsatz von kosteng\u00fcnstiger und sauberer Energieerzeugung. Verschiedene Beispiele aus einer Fallstudie demonstrieren den Einsatz des entwickelten EMS und der Entwurfsmethodik",

      "title": "Synchronverter-based STATCOM control with voltage imbalance compensation",
      "abstract": "In this work, a synchronverter-based control strategy is proposed to operate the STATCOM as a synchronous compensator. Moreover, to cope with unbalanced conditions that may appear at the grid, a novel voltage imbalance compensation control is developed to work harmoniously with the main synchronverter model. The used base synchronous generator model is derived from a general AC machine in space vector representation. Practical details about the controller design are addressed as well as a small-signal model for stability analysis and parameter tuning. Two scenarios are simulated: large-scale and small-scale system, the latter being used as a validation step for implementation in a small experimental setup. Both simulations and experimental results confirm the suitable performance of the proposed control.Neste trabalho, um controle baseado em synchronverter \u00e9 proposto para operar um STATCOM como compensador s\u00edncrono.

      "title": "A Reserve-Based Method for Mitigating the Impact of Renewable Energy",
      "abstract": "The fundamental operating paradigm of today\\u27s power systems is undergoing a significant shift. This is partially motivated by the increased desire for incorporating variable renewable energy resources into generation portfolios. While these generating technologies offer clean energy at zero marginal cost, i.e. no fuel costs, they also offer unique operating challenges for system operators. Perhaps the biggest operating challenge these resources introduce is accommodating their intermittent fuel source availability. For this reason, these generators increase the system-wide variability and uncertainty. As a result, system operators are revisiting traditional operating strategies to more efficiently incorporate these generation resources to maximize the benefit they provide while minimizing the challenges they introduce.\nOne way system operators have accounted for system variability and uncertainty is through the use of operating reserves. Operating reserves can be simplified as excess capacity kept online during real time operations to help accommodate unforeseen fluctuations in demand. With new generation resources, a new class of operating reserves has emerged that is generally known as flexibility, or ramping, reserves. This new reserve class is meant to better position systems to mitigate severe ramping in the net load profile. The best way to define this new requirement is still under investigation. Typical requirement definitions focus on the additional uncertainty introduced by variable generation and there is room for improvement regarding explicit consideration for the variability they introduce. An exogenous reserve modification method is introduced in this report that can improve system reliability with minimal impacts on total system wide production costs.\nAnother potential solution to this problem is to formulate the problem as a stochastic programming problem. The unit commitment and economic dispatch problems are typically formulated as deterministic problems due to fast solution times and the solutions being sufficient for operations. Improvements in technical computing hardware have reignited interest in stochastic modeling. The variability of wind and solar naturally lends itself to stochastic modeling. The use of explicit reserve requirements in stochastic models is an area of interest for power system researchers. This report introduces a new reserve modification implementation based on previous results to be used in a stochastic modeling framework.\nWith technological improvements in distributed generation technologies, microgrids are currently being researched and implemented. Microgrids are small power systems that have the ability to serve their demand with their own generation resources and may have a connection to a larger power system. As battery technologies improve, they are becoming a more viable option in these distributed power systems and research is necessary to determine the most efficient way to utilize them. This report will investigate several unique operating strategies for batteries in small power systems and analyze their benefits. These new operating strategies will help reduce operating costs and improve system reliability",

      "abstract": "Emerging applications in Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems\n(CPS) present novel challenges to Big Data platforms for performing online\nanalytics. Ubiquitous sensors from IoT deployments are able to generate data\nstreams at high velocity, that include information from a variety of domains,\nand accumulate to large volumes on disk. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is\nrecognized as an important real-time computing paradigm for analyzing\ncontinuous data streams. However, existing work on CEP is largely limited to\nrelational query processing, exposing two distinctive gaps for query\nspecification and execution: (1) infusing the relational query model with\nhigher level knowledge semantics, and (2) seamless query evaluation across\ntemporal spaces that span past, present and future events. These allow\naccessible analytics over data streams having properties from different\ndisciplines, and help span the velocity (real-time) and volume (persistent)\ndimensions. In this article, we introduce a Knowledge-infused CEP (X-CEP)\nframework that provides domain-aware knowledge query constructs along with\ntemporal operators that allow end-to-end queries to span across real-time and\npersistent streams. We translate this query model to efficient query execution\nover online and offline data streams, proposing several optimizations to\nmitigate the overheads introduced by evaluating semantic predicates and in\naccessing high-volume historic data streams. The proposed X-CEP query model and\nexecution approaches are implemented in our prototype semantic CEP engine,\nSCEPter. We validate our query model using domain-aware CEP queries from a\nreal-world Smart Power Grid application, and experimentally analyze the\nbenefits of our optimizations for executing these queries, using event streams\nfrom a campus-microgrid IoT deployment.Comment: 34 pages, 16 figures, accepted in Future Generation Computer Systems,\n  October 27, 201",

      "title": "Occupant-Centric Modeling and Control for Low-Carbon and Resilient Communities",
      "abstract": "Global climate change and resulting frequent extreme weather events have highlighted the significance of energy sustainability and resilience. Communities, which refer to a group of buildings located geographically together, are important units for energy generation and consumption. Hence, the research of community energy sustainability and resilience has drawn much attention during the past decades. However, there remain many challenges surrounding community energy modeling and control to achieve the low-carbon and resilient goals.\nFirst, few tools are readily available for community-scale dynamic modeling and control-based studies. To address this gap, a community emulator was developed, which was designed to be hierarchical, scalable, and suitable for various applications. Data-driven stochastic building occupancy prediction was integrated into the emulator using logistic regression methods. Based on this work, we publicly released a library for net-zero energy community modeling using the object-oriented equation-based modeling language Modelica.\nSecond, building load control informed by real-time carbon emission signals is underdeveloped as utility price-driven control has so far been dominant. To better facilitate community energy sustainability through decarbonization, we proposed four rule-based carbon emission responsive building control algorithms to reduce the annual carbon emissions through thermostatically controllable loads. The impact of carbon net-metering, as well as the evolvement of the future energy generation mix, is analyzed on top of both momentary and predictive rules. Based on the simulation results, the average annual household carbon emissions are decreased by 6.0% to 20.5% compared to the baseline. The average annual energy consumption is increased by less than 6.7% due to more clean hours over the year. The annual energy cost change lies between -4.1% and 3.4% on top of the baseline.\nThird, the enhancement of community resilience in an islanded mode through optimal operation strategies is often faced with computational challenges given the large number of controllable loads. To tackle this, we proposed a two-layer model predictive control-based resource allocation and load scheduling framework for community resilience enhancement. Within this framework, the community operator layer optimally allocates the available PV generation to each building, while the building agent layer optimally schedules controllable loads to minimize the unserved load ratio while maintaining thermal comfort. We found that the allocation process is mostly constrained by the building load flexibility. More specifically, buildings with less load flexibility tend to be allocated more PV generation than other buildings. Further, we identified the competitive relationship between the objectives of minimizing unserved load ratio and maximize comfort. Therefore, it is necessary for the building agent to have multi-objective optimization.\nFinally, to account for the uncertainties of occupant behavior and its impact on resilient community load scheduling, we developed a preference-aware scheduler for resilient communities. Stochastic occupant thermostat-changing behavior models were introduced into the deterministic load scheduling framework as a source of uncertainty. KRIs such as the unserved load ratio, the required battery size, and the unmet thermal preference hours were adopted to quantify the impacts. Uncertainties from occupants&rsquo; thermal preferences and their impact on load scheduling are then studied and addressed through chance constraints. Generally, the proposed controller performs better in terms of the unmet thermal preference hours and the battery sizes compared to the deterministic controller.</p",

      "abstract": "The motivation of this work is to present an energy cost reduction concept in a home area power network (HAPN) with intelligent generation and flexible load demands. This study endeavors to address the energy management system (EMS) and layout-design challenges faced by HAPN through a systematic design approach. The growing demand for electricity has become a significant burden on traditional power networks, prompting power engineers to seek ways to improve their efficiency. One such solution is to integrate dispersed generation sources, such as photovoltaic (PV) and storage systems, with an appropriate control mechanism at the distribution level. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in interest in the installation of PV-Battery systems, due to their potential to reduce carbon emissions and lower energy costs. This research proposes an optimal economic power dispatch strategy using Model Predictive Control (MPC) to enhance the overall performance of HAPN. A hybrid AC/DC microgrid concept is proposed to address the control choices made by the appliance scheduling and hybrid switching approaches based on a linear programming optimization framework. The suggested optimization criteria improve consumer satisfaction, minimize grid disconnections, and lower overall energy costs by deploying inexpensive clean energy generation and control. Various examples from actual case study demonstrate the use of the established EMS and design methodology.Die Motivation dieser Arbeit besteht darin, ein Konzept zur Senkung der Energiekosten in einem Heimnetzwerk (HAPN) mit intelligenter Erzeugung und  exiblen Lastanforderungen vorzustellen. Im Rahmen dieser Forschungsarbeit wird ein Entwurf f\u00fcr ein HAPN entwickelt, indem das Energiemanagementsystem (EMS) und der Entwurf des Layouts auf der Grundlage des Systemmodells und der betrieblichen Anforderungen gel\u00f6st werden. Die steigende Nachfrage nach Elektrizit\u00e4t ist f\u00fcr traditionelle Stromnetze kostspielig und infrastrukturintensiv. Daher konzentrieren sich Energietechniker darauf, die Effizienz der derzeitigen Netze zu erh\u00f6hen. Dies kann durch die Integration verteilter Erzeugungsanlagen (z. B. Photovoltaik (PV), Speicher) mit einem geeigneten Kontrollmechanismus f\u00fcr das Energiemanagement auf der Verteilungsseite erreicht werden. Dar\u00fcber hinaus hat das Interesse an der Installation von PV-Batterie-basierten Systemen aufgrund der Reduzierung der CO2-Emissionen und der Senkung der Energiekosten erheblich zugenommen. Es wird eine optimale wirtschaftliche Strategie f\u00fcr den Energieeinsatz unter Verwendung einer modellpr\u00e4diktiven Steuerung (MPC) entwickelt. Es wird zudem ein hybrides AC/DC-Microgrid-Konzept vorgeschlagen, um die Steuerungsentscheidungen, die von den Ans\u00e4tzen der Ger\u00e4teplanung und der hybriden Umschaltung getroffen werden, auf der Grundlage eines linearen Programmierungsoptimierungsrahmens zu ber\u00fccksichtigen. Die vorgeschlagenen Optimierungskriterien verbessern die Zufriedenheit der Verbraucher, minimieren Netzabschaltungen und senken die Gesamtenergiekosten durch den Einsatz von kosteng\u00fcnstiger und sauberer Energieerzeugung. Verschiedene Beispiele aus einer Fallstudie demonstrieren den Einsatz des entwickelten EMS und der Entwurfsmethodik",

      "abstract": "In this work, a synchronverter-based control strategy is proposed to operate the STATCOM as a synchronous compensator. Moreover, to cope with unbalanced conditions that may appear at the grid, a novel voltage imbalance compensation control is developed to work harmoniously with the main synchronverter model. The used base synchronous generator model is derived from a general AC machine in space vector representation. Practical details about the controller design are addressed as well as a small-signal model for stability analysis and parameter tuning. Two scenarios are simulated: large-scale and small-scale system, the latter being used as a validation step for implementation in a small experimental setup. Both simulations and experimental results confirm the suitable performance of the proposed control.Neste trabalho, um controle baseado em synchronverter \u00e9 proposto para operar um STATCOM como compensador s\u00edncrono.

      "title": "A Reserve-Based Method for Mitigating the Impact of Renewable Energy",
      "abstract": "The fundamental operating paradigm of today\\u27s power systems is undergoing a significant shift. This is partially motivated by the increased desire for incorporating variable renewable energy resources into generation portfolios. While these generating technologies offer clean energy at zero marginal cost, i.e. no fuel costs, they also offer unique operating challenges for system operators. Perhaps the biggest operating challenge these resources introduce is accommodating their intermittent fuel source availability. For this reason, these generators increase the system-wide variability and uncertainty. As a result, system operators are revisiting traditional operating strategies to more efficiently incorporate these generation resources to maximize the benefit they provide while minimizing the challenges they introduce.\nOne way system operators have accounted for system variability and uncertainty is through the use of operating reserves. Operating reserves can be simplified as excess capacity kept online during real time operations to help accommodate unforeseen fluctuations in demand. With new generation resources, a new class of operating reserves has emerged that is generally known as flexibility, or ramping, reserves. This new reserve class is meant to better position systems to mitigate severe ramping in the net load profile. The best way to define this new requirement is still under investigation. Typical requirement definitions focus on the additional uncertainty introduced by variable generation and there is room for improvement regarding explicit consideration for the variability they introduce. An exogenous reserve modification method is introduced in this report that can improve system reliability with minimal impacts on total system wide production costs.\nAnother potential solution to this problem is to formulate the problem as a stochastic programming problem. The unit commitment and economic dispatch problems are typically formulated as deterministic problems due to fast solution times and the solutions being sufficient for operations. Improvements in technical computing hardware have reignited interest in stochastic modeling. The variability of wind and solar naturally lends itself to stochastic modeling. The use of explicit reserve requirements in stochastic models is an area of interest for power system researchers. This report introduces a new reserve modification implementation based on previous results to be used in a stochastic modeling framework.\nWith technological improvements in distributed generation technologies, microgrids are currently being researched and implemented. Microgrids are small power systems that have the ability to serve their demand with their own generation resources and may have a connection to a larger power system. As battery technologies improve, they are becoming a more viable option in these distributed power systems and research is necessary to determine the most efficient way to utilize them. This report will investigate several unique operating strategies for batteries in small power systems and analyze their benefits. These new operating strategies will help reduce operating costs and improve system reliability",

      "abstract": "Emerging applications in Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems\n(CPS) present novel challenges to Big Data platforms for performing online\nanalytics. Ubiquitous sensors from IoT deployments are able to generate data\nstreams at high velocity, that include information from a variety of domains,\nand accumulate to large volumes on disk. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is\nrecognized as an important real-time computing paradigm for analyzing\ncontinuous data streams. However, existing work on CEP is largely limited to\nrelational query processing, exposing two distinctive gaps for query\nspecification and execution: (1) infusing the relational query model with\nhigher level knowledge semantics, and (2) seamless query evaluation across\ntemporal spaces that span past, present and future events. These allow\naccessible analytics over data streams having properties from different\ndisciplines, and help span the velocity (real-time) and volume (persistent)\ndimensions. In this article, we introduce a Knowledge-infused CEP (X-CEP)\nframework that provides domain-aware knowledge query constructs along with\ntemporal operators that allow end-to-end queries to span across real-time and\npersistent streams. We translate this query model to efficient query execution\nover online and offline data streams, proposing several optimizations to\nmitigate the overheads introduced by evaluating semantic predicates and in\naccessing high-volume historic data streams. The proposed X-CEP query model and\nexecution approaches are implemented in our prototype semantic CEP engine,\nSCEPter. We validate our query model using domain-aware CEP queries from a\nreal-world Smart Power Grid application, and experimentally analyze the\nbenefits of our optimizations for executing these queries, using event streams\nfrom a campus-microgrid IoT deployment.Comment: 34 pages, 16 figures, accepted in Future Generation Computer Systems,\n  October 27, 201",

      "title": "Occupant-Centric Modeling and Control for Low-Carbon and Resilient Communities",
      "abstract": "Global climate change and resulting frequent extreme weather events have highlighted the significance of energy sustainability and resilience. Communities, which refer to a group of buildings located geographically together, are important units for energy generation and consumption. Hence, the research of community energy sustainability and resilience has drawn much attention during the past decades. However, there remain many challenges surrounding community energy modeling and control to achieve the low-carbon and resilient goals.\nFirst, few tools are readily available for community-scale dynamic modeling and control-based studies. To address this gap, a community emulator was developed, which was designed to be hierarchical, scalable, and suitable for various applications. Data-driven stochastic building occupancy prediction was integrated into the emulator using logistic regression methods. Based on this work, we publicly released a library for net-zero energy community modeling using the object-oriented equation-based modeling language Modelica.\nSecond, building load control informed by real-time carbon emission signals is underdeveloped as utility price-driven control has so far been dominant. To better facilitate community energy sustainability through decarbonization, we proposed four rule-based carbon emission responsive building control algorithms to reduce the annual carbon emissions through thermostatically controllable loads. The impact of carbon net-metering, as well as the evolvement of the future energy generation mix, is analyzed on top of both momentary and predictive rules. Based on the simulation results, the average annual household carbon emissions are decreased by 6.0% to 20.5% compared to the baseline. The average annual energy consumption is increased by less than 6.7% due to more clean hours over the year. The annual energy cost change lies between -4.1% and 3.4% on top of the baseline.\nThird, the enhancement of community resilience in an islanded mode through optimal operation strategies is often faced with computational challenges given the large number of controllable loads. To tackle this, we proposed a two-layer model predictive control-based resource allocation and load scheduling framework for community resilience enhancement. Within this framework, the community operator layer optimally allocates the available PV generation to each building, while the building agent layer optimally schedules controllable loads to minimize the unserved load ratio while maintaining thermal comfort. We found that the allocation process is mostly constrained by the building load flexibility. More specifically, buildings with less load flexibility tend to be allocated more PV generation than other buildings. Further, we identified the competitive relationship between the objectives of minimizing unserved load ratio and maximize comfort. Therefore, it is necessary for the building agent to have multi-objective optimization.\nFinally, to account for the uncertainties of occupant behavior and its impact on resilient community load scheduling, we developed a preference-aware scheduler for resilient communities. Stochastic occupant thermostat-changing behavior models were introduced into the deterministic load scheduling framework as a source of uncertainty. KRIs such as the unserved load ratio, the required battery size, and the unmet thermal preference hours were adopted to quantify the impacts. Uncertainties from occupants&rsquo; thermal preferences and their impact on load scheduling are then studied and addressed through chance constraints. Generally, the proposed controller performs better in terms of the unmet thermal preference hours and the battery sizes compared to the deterministic controller.</p",

      "abstract": "The motivation of this work is to present an energy cost reduction concept in a home area power network (HAPN) with intelligent generation and flexible load demands. This study endeavors to address the energy management system (EMS) and layout-design challenges faced by HAPN through a systematic design approach. The growing demand for electricity has become a significant burden on traditional power networks, prompting power engineers to seek ways to improve their efficiency. One such solution is to integrate dispersed generation sources, such as photovoltaic (PV) and storage systems, with an appropriate control mechanism at the distribution level. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in interest in the installation of PV-Battery systems, due to their potential to reduce carbon emissions and lower energy costs. This research proposes an optimal economic power dispatch strategy using Model Predictive Control (MPC) to enhance the overall performance of HAPN. A hybrid AC/DC microgrid concept is proposed to address the control choices made by the appliance scheduling and hybrid switching approaches based on a linear programming optimization framework. The suggested optimization criteria improve consumer satisfaction, minimize grid disconnections, and lower overall energy costs by deploying inexpensive clean energy generation and control. Various examples from actual case study demonstrate the use of the established EMS and design methodology.Die Motivation dieser Arbeit besteht darin, ein Konzept zur Senkung der Energiekosten in einem Heimnetzwerk (HAPN) mit intelligenter Erzeugung und  exiblen Lastanforderungen vorzustellen. Im Rahmen dieser Forschungsarbeit wird ein Entwurf f\u00fcr ein HAPN entwickelt, indem das Energiemanagementsystem (EMS) und der Entwurf des Layouts auf der Grundlage des Systemmodells und der betrieblichen Anforderungen gel\u00f6st werden. Die steigende Nachfrage nach Elektrizit\u00e4t ist f\u00fcr traditionelle Stromnetze kostspielig und infrastrukturintensiv. Daher konzentrieren sich Energietechniker darauf, die Effizienz der derzeitigen Netze zu erh\u00f6hen. Dies kann durch die Integration verteilter Erzeugungsanlagen (z. B. Photovoltaik (PV), Speicher) mit einem geeigneten Kontrollmechanismus f\u00fcr das Energiemanagement auf der Verteilungsseite erreicht werden. Dar\u00fcber hinaus hat das Interesse an der Installation von PV-Batterie-basierten Systemen aufgrund der Reduzierung der CO2-Emissionen und der Senkung der Energiekosten erheblich zugenommen. Es wird eine optimale wirtschaftliche Strategie f\u00fcr den Energieeinsatz unter Verwendung einer modellpr\u00e4diktiven Steuerung (MPC) entwickelt. Es wird zudem ein hybrides AC/DC-Microgrid-Konzept vorgeschlagen, um die Steuerungsentscheidungen, die von den Ans\u00e4tzen der Ger\u00e4teplanung und der hybriden Umschaltung getroffen werden, auf der Grundlage eines linearen Programmierungsoptimierungsrahmens zu ber\u00fccksichtigen. Die vorgeschlagenen Optimierungskriterien verbessern die Zufriedenheit der Verbraucher, minimieren Netzabschaltungen und senken die Gesamtenergiekosten durch den Einsatz von kosteng\u00fcnstiger und sauberer Energieerzeugung. Verschiedene Beispiele aus einer Fallstudie demonstrieren den Einsatz des entwickelten EMS und der Entwurfsmethodik",

      "abstract": "In this work, a synchronverter-based control strategy is proposed to operate the STATCOM as a synchronous compensator. Moreover, to cope with unbalanced conditions that may appear at the grid, a novel voltage imbalance compensation control is developed to work harmoniously with the main synchronverter model. The used base synchronous generator model is derived from a general AC machine in space vector representation. Practical details about the controller design are addressed as well as a small-signal model for stability analysis and parameter tuning. Two scenarios are simulated: large-scale and small-scale system, the latter being used as a validation step for implementation in a small experimental setup. Both simulations and experimental results confirm the suitable performance of the proposed control.Neste trabalho, um controle baseado em synchronverter \u00e9 proposto para operar um STATCOM como compensador s\u00edncrono.

      "title": "A Reserve-Based Method for Mitigating the Impact of Renewable Energy",
      "abstract": "The fundamental operating paradigm of today\\u27s power systems is undergoing a significant shift. This is partially motivated by the increased desire for incorporating variable renewable energy resources into generation portfolios. While these generating technologies offer clean energy at zero marginal cost, i.e. no fuel costs, they also offer unique operating challenges for system operators. Perhaps the biggest operating challenge these resources introduce is accommodating their intermittent fuel source availability. For this reason, these generators increase the system-wide variability and uncertainty. As a result, system operators are revisiting traditional operating strategies to more efficiently incorporate these generation resources to maximize the benefit they provide while minimizing the challenges they introduce.\nOne way system operators have accounted for system variability and uncertainty is through the use of operating reserves. Operating reserves can be simplified as excess capacity kept online during real time operations to help accommodate unforeseen fluctuations in demand. With new generation resources, a new class of operating reserves has emerged that is generally known as flexibility, or ramping, reserves. This new reserve class is meant to better position systems to mitigate severe ramping in the net load profile. The best way to define this new requirement is still under investigation. Typical requirement definitions focus on the additional uncertainty introduced by variable generation and there is room for improvement regarding explicit consideration for the variability they introduce. An exogenous reserve modification method is introduced in this report that can improve system reliability with minimal impacts on total system wide production costs.\nAnother potential solution to this problem is to formulate the problem as a stochastic programming problem. The unit commitment and economic dispatch problems are typically formulated as deterministic problems due to fast solution times and the solutions being sufficient for operations. Improvements in technical computing hardware have reignited interest in stochastic modeling. The variability of wind and solar naturally lends itself to stochastic modeling. The use of explicit reserve requirements in stochastic models is an area of interest for power system researchers. This report introduces a new reserve modification implementation based on previous results to be used in a stochastic modeling framework.\nWith technological improvements in distributed generation technologies, microgrids are currently being researched and implemented. Microgrids are small power systems that have the ability to serve their demand with their own generation resources and may have a connection to a larger power system. As battery technologies improve, they are becoming a more viable option in these distributed power systems and research is necessary to determine the most efficient way to utilize them. This report will investigate several unique operating strategies for batteries in small power systems and analyze their benefits. These new operating strategies will help reduce operating costs and improve system reliability",

      "abstract": "Emerging applications in Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems\n(CPS) present novel challenges to Big Data platforms for performing online\nanalytics. Ubiquitous sensors from IoT deployments are able to generate data\nstreams at high velocity, that include information from a variety of domains,\nand accumulate to large volumes on disk. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is\nrecognized as an important real-time computing paradigm for analyzing\ncontinuous data streams. However, existing work on CEP is largely limited to\nrelational query processing, exposing two distinctive gaps for query\nspecification and execution: (1) infusing the relational query model with\nhigher level knowledge semantics, and (2) seamless query evaluation across\ntemporal spaces that span past, present and future events. These allow\naccessible analytics over data streams having properties from different\ndisciplines, and help span the velocity (real-time) and volume (persistent)\ndimensions. In this article, we introduce a Knowledge-infused CEP (X-CEP)\nframework that provides domain-aware knowledge query constructs along with\ntemporal operators that allow end-to-end queries to span across real-time and\npersistent streams. We translate this query model to efficient query execution\nover online and offline data streams, proposing several optimizations to\nmitigate the overheads introduced by evaluating semantic predicates and in\naccessing high-volume historic data streams. The proposed X-CEP query model and\nexecution approaches are implemented in our prototype semantic CEP engine,\nSCEPter. We validate our query model using domain-aware CEP queries from a\nreal-world Smart Power Grid application, and experimentally analyze the\nbenefits of our optimizations for executing these queries, using event streams\nfrom a campus-microgrid IoT deployment.Comment: 34 pages, 16 figures, accepted in Future Generation Computer Systems,\n  October 27, 201",

      "abstract": "Global climate change and resulting frequent extreme weather events have highlighted the significance of energy sustainability and resilience. Communities, which refer to a group of buildings located geographically together, are important units for energy generation and consumption. Hence, the research of community energy sustainability and resilience has drawn much attention during the past decades. However, there remain many challenges surrounding community energy modeling and control to achieve the low-carbon and resilient goals.\nFirst, few tools are readily available for community-scale dynamic modeling and control-based studies. To address this gap, a community emulator was developed, which was designed to be hierarchical, scalable, and suitable for various applications. Data-driven stochastic building occupancy prediction was integrated into the emulator using logistic regression methods. Based on this work, we publicly released a library for net-zero energy community modeling using the object-oriented equation-based modeling language Modelica.\nSecond, building load control informed by real-time carbon emission signals is underdeveloped as utility price-driven control has so far been dominant. To better facilitate community energy sustainability through decarbonization, we proposed four rule-based carbon emission responsive building control algorithms to reduce the annual carbon emissions through thermostatically controllable loads. The impact of carbon net-metering, as well as the evolvement of the future energy generation mix, is analyzed on top of both momentary and predictive rules. Based on the simulation results, the average annual household carbon emissions are decreased by 6.0% to 20.5% compared to the baseline. The average annual energy consumption is increased by less than 6.7% due to more clean hours over the year. The annual energy cost change lies between -4.1% and 3.4% on top of the baseline.\nThird, the enhancement of community resilience in an islanded mode through optimal operation strategies is often faced with computational challenges given the large number of controllable loads. To tackle this, we proposed a two-layer model predictive control-based resource allocation and load scheduling framework for community resilience enhancement. Within this framework, the community operator layer optimally allocates the available PV generation to each building, while the building agent layer optimally schedules controllable loads to minimize the unserved load ratio while maintaining thermal comfort. We found that the allocation process is mostly constrained by the building load flexibility. More specifically, buildings with less load flexibility tend to be allocated more PV generation than other buildings. Further, we identified the competitive relationship between the objectives of minimizing unserved load ratio and maximize comfort. Therefore, it is necessary for the building agent to have multi-objective optimization.\nFinally, to account for the uncertainties of occupant behavior and its impact on resilient community load scheduling, we developed a preference-aware scheduler for resilient communities. Stochastic occupant thermostat-changing behavior models were introduced into the deterministic load scheduling framework as a source of uncertainty. KRIs such as the unserved load ratio, the required battery size, and the unmet thermal preference hours were adopted to quantify the impacts. Uncertainties from occupants&rsquo; thermal preferences and their impact on load scheduling are then studied and addressed through chance constraints. Generally, the proposed controller performs better in terms of the unmet thermal preference hours and the battery sizes compared to the deterministic controller.</p",

      "abstract": "The motivation of this work is to present an energy cost reduction concept in a home area power network (HAPN) with intelligent generation and flexible load demands. This study endeavors to address the energy management system (EMS) and layout-design challenges faced by HAPN through a systematic design approach. The growing demand for electricity has become a significant burden on traditional power networks, prompting power engineers to seek ways to improve their efficiency. One such solution is to integrate dispersed generation sources, such as photovoltaic (PV) and storage systems, with an appropriate control mechanism at the distribution level. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in interest in the installation of PV-Battery systems, due to their potential to reduce carbon emissions and lower energy costs. This research proposes an optimal economic power dispatch strategy using Model Predictive Control (MPC) to enhance the overall performance of HAPN. A hybrid AC/DC microgrid concept is proposed to address the control choices made by the appliance scheduling and hybrid switching approaches based on a linear programming optimization framework. The suggested optimization criteria improve consumer satisfaction, minimize grid disconnections, and lower overall energy costs by deploying inexpensive clean energy generation and control. Various examples from actual case study demonstrate the use of the established EMS and design methodology.Die Motivation dieser Arbeit besteht darin, ein Konzept zur Senkung der Energiekosten in einem Heimnetzwerk (HAPN) mit intelligenter Erzeugung und  exiblen Lastanforderungen vorzustellen. Im Rahmen dieser Forschungsarbeit wird ein Entwurf f\u00fcr ein HAPN entwickelt, indem das Energiemanagementsystem (EMS) und der Entwurf des Layouts auf der Grundlage des Systemmodells und der betrieblichen Anforderungen gel\u00f6st werden. Die steigende Nachfrage nach Elektrizit\u00e4t ist f\u00fcr traditionelle Stromnetze kostspielig und infrastrukturintensiv. Daher konzentrieren sich Energietechniker darauf, die Effizienz der derzeitigen Netze zu erh\u00f6hen. Dies kann durch die Integration verteilter Erzeugungsanlagen (z. B. Photovoltaik (PV), Speicher) mit einem geeigneten Kontrollmechanismus f\u00fcr das Energiemanagement auf der Verteilungsseite erreicht werden. Dar\u00fcber hinaus hat das Interesse an der Installation von PV-Batterie-basierten Systemen aufgrund der Reduzierung der CO2-Emissionen und der Senkung der Energiekosten erheblich zugenommen. Es wird eine optimale wirtschaftliche Strategie f\u00fcr den Energieeinsatz unter Verwendung einer modellpr\u00e4diktiven Steuerung (MPC) entwickelt. Es wird zudem ein hybrides AC/DC-Microgrid-Konzept vorgeschlagen, um die Steuerungsentscheidungen, die von den Ans\u00e4tzen der Ger\u00e4teplanung und der hybriden Umschaltung getroffen werden, auf der Grundlage eines linearen Programmierungsoptimierungsrahmens zu ber\u00fccksichtigen. Die vorgeschlagenen Optimierungskriterien verbessern die Zufriedenheit der Verbraucher, minimieren Netzabschaltungen und senken die Gesamtenergiekosten durch den Einsatz von kosteng\u00fcnstiger und sauberer Energieerzeugung. Verschiedene Beispiele aus einer Fallstudie demonstrieren den Einsatz des entwickelten EMS und der Entwurfsmethodik",

      "abstract": "In this work, a synchronverter-based control strategy is proposed to operate the STATCOM as a synchronous compensator. Moreover, to cope with unbalanced conditions that may appear at the grid, a novel voltage imbalance compensation control is developed to work harmoniously with the main synchronverter model.

      "title": "A Reserve-Based Method for Mitigating the Impact of Renewable Energy",
      "abstract": "The fundamental operating paradigm of today\\u27s power systems is undergoing a significant shift. This is partially motivated by the increased desire for incorporating variable renewable energy resources into generation portfolios. While these generating technologies offer clean energy at zero marginal cost, i.e. no fuel costs, they also offer unique operating challenges for system operators. Perhaps the biggest operating challenge these resources introduce is accommodating their intermittent fuel source availability. For this reason, these generators increase the system-wide variability and uncertainty. As a result, system operators are revisiting traditional operating strategies to more efficiently incorporate these generation resources to maximize the benefit they provide while minimizing the challenges they introduce.\nOne way system operators have accounted for system variability and uncertainty is through the use of operating reserves. Operating reserves can be simplified as excess capacity kept online during real time operations to help accommodate unforeseen fluctuations in demand. With new generation resources, a new class of operating reserves has emerged that is generally known as flexibility, or ramping, reserves. This new reserve class is meant to better position systems to mitigate severe ramping in the net load profile. The best way to define this new requirement is still under investigation. Typical requirement definitions focus on the additional uncertainty introduced by variable generation and there is room for improvement regarding explicit consideration for the variability they introduce. An exogenous reserve modification method is introduced in this report that can improve system reliability with minimal impacts on total system wide production costs.\nAnother potential solution to this problem is to formulate the problem as a stochastic programming problem. The unit commitment and economic dispatch problems are typically formulated as deterministic problems due to fast solution times and the solutions being sufficient for operations. Improvements in technical computing hardware have reignited interest in stochastic modeling. The variability of wind and solar naturally lends itself to stochastic modeling. The use of explicit reserve requirements in stochastic models is an area of interest for power system researchers. This report introduces a new reserve modification implementation based on previous results to be used in a stochastic modeling framework.\nWith technological improvements in distributed generation technologies, microgrids are currently being researched and implemented. Microgrids are small power systems that have the ability to serve their demand with their own generation resources and may have a connection to a larger power system. As battery technologies improve, they are becoming a more viable option in these distributed power systems and research is necessary to determine the most efficient way to utilize them. This report will investigate several unique operating strategies for batteries in small power systems and analyze their benefits. These new operating strategies will help reduce operating costs and improve system reliability",

      "abstract": "Emerging applications in Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems\n(CPS) present novel challenges to Big Data platforms for performing online\nanalytics. Ubiquitous sensors from IoT deployments are able to generate data\nstreams at high velocity, that include information from a variety of domains,\nand accumulate to large volumes on disk. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is\nrecognized as an important real-time computing paradigm for analyzing\ncontinuous data streams. However, existing work on CEP is largely limited to\nrelational query processing, exposing two distinctive gaps for query\nspecification and execution: (1) infusing the relational query model with\nhigher level knowledge semantics, and (2) seamless query evaluation across\ntemporal spaces that span past, present and future events. These allow\naccessible analytics over data streams having properties from different\ndisciplines, and help span the velocity (real-time) and volume (persistent)\ndimensions. In this article, we introduce a Knowledge-infused CEP (X-CEP)\nframework that provides domain-aware knowledge query constructs along with\ntemporal operators that allow end-to-end queries to span across real-time and\npersistent streams. We translate this query model to efficient query execution\nover online and offline data streams, proposing several optimizations to\nmitigate the overheads introduced by evaluating semantic predicates and in\naccessing high-volume historic data streams. The proposed X-CEP query model and\nexecution approaches are implemented in our prototype semantic CEP engine,\nSCEPter. We validate our query model using domain-aware CEP queries from a\nreal-world Smart Power Grid application, and experimentally analyze the\nbenefits of our optimizations for executing these queries, using event streams\nfrom a campus-microgrid IoT deployment.Comment: 34 pages, 16 figures, accepted in Future Generation Computer Systems,\n  October 27, 201",

      "title": "Occupant-Centric Modeling and Control for Low-Carbon and Resilient Communities",
      "abstract": "Global climate change and resulting frequent extreme weather events have highlighted the significance of energy sustainability and resilience. Communities, which refer to a group of buildings located geographically together, are important units for energy generation and consumption. Hence, the research of community energy sustainability and resilience has drawn much attention during the past decades. However, there remain many challenges surrounding community energy modeling and control to achieve the low-carbon and resilient goals.\nFirst, few tools are readily available for community-scale dynamic modeling and control-based studies. To address this gap, a community emulator was developed, which was designed to be hierarchical, scalable, and suitable for various applications. Data-driven stochastic building occupancy prediction was integrated into the emulator using logistic regression methods. Based on this work, we publicly released a library for net-zero energy community modeling using the object-oriented equation-based modeling language Modelica.\nSecond, building load control informed by real-time carbon emission signals is underdeveloped as utility price-driven control has so far been dominant. To better facilitate community energy sustainability through decarbonization, we proposed four rule-based carbon emission responsive building control algorithms to reduce the annual carbon emissions through thermostatically controllable loads. The impact of carbon net-metering, as well as the evolvement of the future energy generation mix, is analyzed on top of both momentary and predictive rules. Based on the simulation results, the average annual household carbon emissions are decreased by 6.0% to 20.5% compared to the baseline. The average annual energy consumption is increased by less than 6.7% due to more clean hours over the year. The annual energy cost change lies between -4.1% and 3.4% on top of the baseline.\nThird, the enhancement of community resilience in an islanded mode through optimal operation strategies is often faced with computational challenges given the large number of controllable loads. To tackle this, we proposed a two-layer model predictive control-based resource allocation and load scheduling framework for community resilience enhancement. Within this framework, the community operator layer optimally allocates the available PV generation to each building, while the building agent layer optimally schedules controllable loads to minimize the unserved load ratio while maintaining thermal comfort. We found that the allocation process is mostly constrained by the building load flexibility. More specifically, buildings with less load flexibility tend to be allocated more PV generation than other buildings. Further, we identified the competitive relationship between the objectives of minimizing unserved load ratio and maximize comfort. Therefore, it is necessary for the building agent to have multi-objective optimization.\nFinally, to account for the uncertainties of occupant behavior and its impact on resilient community load scheduling, we developed a preference-aware scheduler for resilient communities. Stochastic occupant thermostat-changing behavior models were introduced into the deterministic load scheduling framework as a source of uncertainty. KRIs such as the unserved load ratio, the required battery size, and the unmet thermal preference hours were adopted to quantify the impacts. Uncertainties from occupants&rsquo; thermal preferences and their impact on load scheduling are then studied and addressed through chance constraints. Generally, the proposed controller performs better in terms of the unmet thermal preference hours and the battery sizes compared to the deterministic controller.</p",

      "abstract": "The motivation of this work is to present an energy cost reduction concept in a home area power network (HAPN) with intelligent generation and flexible load demands. This study endeavors to address the energy management system (EMS) and layout-design challenges faced by HAPN through a systematic design approach. The growing demand for electricity has become a significant burden on traditional power networks, prompting power engineers to seek ways to improve their efficiency. One such solution is to integrate dispersed generation sources, such as photovoltaic (PV) and storage systems, with an appropriate control mechanism at the distribution level. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in interest in the installation of PV-Battery systems, due to their potential to reduce carbon emissions and lower energy costs. This research proposes an optimal economic power dispatch strategy using Model Predictive Control (MPC) to enhance the overall performance of HAPN. A hybrid AC/DC microgrid concept is proposed to address the control choices made by the appliance scheduling and hybrid switching approaches based on a linear programming optimization framework. The suggested optimization criteria improve consumer satisfaction, minimize grid disconnections, and lower overall energy costs by deploying inexpensive clean energy generation and control. Various examples from actual case study demonstrate the use of the established EMS and design methodology.Die Motivation dieser Arbeit besteht darin, ein Konzept zur Senkung der Energiekosten in einem Heimnetzwerk (HAPN) mit intelligenter Erzeugung und  exiblen Lastanforderungen vorzustellen. Im Rahmen dieser Forschungsarbeit wird ein Entwurf f\u00fcr ein HAPN entwickelt, indem das Energiemanagementsystem (EMS) und der Entwurf des Layouts auf der Grundlage des Systemmodells und der betrieblichen Anforderungen gel\u00f6st werden. Die steigende Nachfrage nach Elektrizit\u00e4t ist f\u00fcr traditionelle Stromnetze kostspielig und infrastrukturintensiv. Daher konzentrieren sich Energietechniker darauf, die Effizienz der derzeitigen Netze zu erh\u00f6hen. Dies kann durch die Integration verteilter Erzeugungsanlagen (z. B. Photovoltaik (PV), Speicher) mit einem geeigneten Kontrollmechanismus f\u00fcr das Energiemanagement auf der Verteilungsseite erreicht werden. Dar\u00fcber hinaus hat das Interesse an der Installation von PV-Batterie-basierten Systemen aufgrund der Reduzierung der CO2-Emissionen und der Senkung der Energiekosten erheblich zugenommen. Es wird eine optimale wirtschaftliche Strategie f\u00fcr den Energieeinsatz unter Verwendung einer modellpr\u00e4diktiven Steuerung (MPC) entwickelt. Es wird zudem ein hybrides AC/DC-Microgrid-Konzept vorgeschlagen, um die Steuerungsentscheidungen, die von den Ans\u00e4tzen der Ger\u00e4teplanung und der hybriden Umschaltung getroffen werden, auf der Grundlage eines linearen Programmierungsoptimierungsrahmens zu ber\u00fccksichtigen. Die vorgeschlagenen Optimierungskriterien verbessern die Zufriedenheit der Verbraucher, minimieren Netzabschaltungen und senken die Gesamtenergiekosten durch den Einsatz von kosteng\u00fcnstiger und sauberer Energieerzeugung. Verschiedene Beispiele aus einer Fallstudie demonstrieren den Einsatz des entwickelten EMS und der Entwurfsmethodik",

Moreover, to cope with unbalanced conditions that may appear at the grid, a novel voltage imbalance compensation control is developed to work harmoniously with the main synchronverter model.

Practical details about the controller design are addressed as well as a small-signal model for stability analysis and parameter tuning.

      "title": "A Reserve-Based Method for Mitigating the Impact of Renewable Energy",
      "abstract": "The fundamental operating paradigm of today\\u27s power systems is undergoing a significant shift. This is partially motivated by the increased desire for incorporating variable renewable energy resources into generation portfolios. While these generating technologies offer clean energy at zero marginal cost, i.e. no fuel costs, they also offer unique operating challenges for system operators. Perhaps the biggest operating challenge these resources introduce is accommodating their intermittent fuel source availability. For this reason, these generators increase the system-wide variability and uncertainty. As a result, system operators are revisiting traditional operating strategies to more efficiently incorporate these generation resources to maximize the benefit they provide while minimizing the challenges they introduce.\nOne way system operators have accounted for system variability and uncertainty is through the use of operating reserves. Operating reserves can be simplified as excess capacity kept online during real time operations to help accommodate unforeseen fluctuations in demand. With new generation resources, a new class of operating reserves has emerged that is generally known as flexibility, or ramping, reserves. This new reserve class is meant to better position systems to mitigate severe ramping in the net load profile. The best way to define this new requirement is still under investigation. Typical requirement definitions focus on the additional uncertainty introduced by variable generation and there is room for improvement regarding explicit consideration for the variability they introduce. An exogenous reserve modification method is introduced in this report that can improve system reliability with minimal impacts on total system wide production costs.\nAnother potential solution to this problem is to formulate the problem as a stochastic programming problem. The unit commitment and economic dispatch problems are typically formulated as deterministic problems due to fast solution times and the solutions being sufficient for operations. Improvements in technical computing hardware have reignited interest in stochastic modeling. The variability of wind and solar naturally lends itself to stochastic modeling. The use of explicit reserve requirements in stochastic models is an area of interest for power system researchers. This report introduces a new reserve modification implementation based on previous results to be used in a stochastic modeling framework.\nWith technological improvements in distributed generation technologies, microgrids are currently being researched and implemented. Microgrids are small power systems that have the ability to serve their demand with their own generation resources and may have a connection to a larger power system. As battery technologies improve, they are becoming a more viable option in these distributed power systems and research is necessary to determine the most efficient way to utilize them. This report will investigate several unique operating strategies for batteries in small power systems and analyze their benefits. These new operating strategies will help reduce operating costs and improve system reliability",

      "abstract": "Emerging applications in Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems\n(CPS) present novel challenges to Big Data platforms for performing online\nanalytics. Ubiquitous sensors from IoT deployments are able to generate data\nstreams at high velocity, that include information from a variety of domains,\nand accumulate to large volumes on disk. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is\nrecognized as an important real-time computing paradigm for analyzing\ncontinuous data streams. However, existing work on CEP is largely limited to\nrelational query processing, exposing two distinctive gaps for query\nspecification and execution: (1) infusing the relational query model with\nhigher level knowledge semantics, and (2) seamless query evaluation across\ntemporal spaces that span past, present and future events. These allow\naccessible analytics over data streams having properties from different\ndisciplines, and help span the velocity (real-time) and volume (persistent)\ndimensions. In this article, we introduce a Knowledge-infused CEP (X-CEP)\nframework that provides domain-aware knowledge query constructs along with\ntemporal operators that allow end-to-end queries to span across real-time and\npersistent streams. We translate this query model to efficient query execution\nover online and offline data streams, proposing several optimizations to\nmitigate the overheads introduced by evaluating semantic predicates and in\naccessing high-volume historic data streams. The proposed X-CEP query model and\nexecution approaches are implemented in our prototype semantic CEP engine,\nSCEPter. We validate our query model using domain-aware CEP queries from a\nreal-world Smart Power Grid application, and experimentally analyze the\nbenefits of our optimizations for executing these queries, using event streams\nfrom a campus-microgrid IoT deployment.Comment: 34 pages, 16 figures, accepted in Future Generation Computer Systems,\n  October 27, 201",

      "title": "Occupant-Centric Modeling and Control for Low-Carbon and Resilient Communities",
      "abstract": "Global climate change and resulting frequent extreme weather events have highlighted the significance of energy sustainability and resilience. Communities, which refer to a group of buildings located geographically together, are important units for energy generation and consumption. Hence, the research of community energy sustainability and resilience has drawn much attention during the past decades. However, there remain many challenges surrounding community energy modeling and control to achieve the low-carbon and resilient goals.\nFirst, few tools are readily available for community-scale dynamic modeling and control-based studies. To address this gap, a community emulator was developed, which was designed to be hierarchical, scalable, and suitable for various applications. Data-driven stochastic building occupancy prediction was integrated into the emulator using logistic regression methods. Based on this work, we publicly released a library for net-zero energy community modeling using the object-oriented equation-based modeling language Modelica.\nSecond, building load control informed by real-time carbon emission signals is underdeveloped as utility price-driven control has so far been dominant. To better facilitate community energy sustainability through decarbonization, we proposed four rule-based carbon emission responsive building control algorithms to reduce the annual carbon emissions through thermostatically controllable loads. The impact of carbon net-metering, as well as the evolvement of the future energy generation mix, is analyzed on top of both momentary and predictive rules. Based on the simulation results, the average annual household carbon emissions are decreased by 6.0% to 20.5% compared to the baseline. The average annual energy consumption is increased by less than 6.7% due to more clean hours over the year. The annual energy cost change lies between -4.1% and 3.4% on top of the baseline.\nThird, the enhancement of community resilience in an islanded mode through optimal operation strategies is often faced with computational challenges given the large number of controllable loads. To tackle this, we proposed a two-layer model predictive control-based resource allocation and load scheduling framework for community resilience enhancement. Within this framework, the community operator layer optimally allocates the available PV generation to each building, while the building agent layer optimally schedules controllable loads to minimize the unserved load ratio while maintaining thermal comfort. We found that the allocation process is mostly constrained by the building load flexibility. More specifically, buildings with less load flexibility tend to be allocated more PV generation than other buildings. Further, we identified the competitive relationship between the objectives of minimizing unserved load ratio and maximize comfort. Therefore, it is necessary for the building agent to have multi-objective optimization.\nFinally, to account for the uncertainties of occupant behavior and its impact on resilient community load scheduling, we developed a preference-aware scheduler for resilient communities. Stochastic occupant thermostat-changing behavior models were introduced into the deterministic load scheduling framework as a source of uncertainty. KRIs such as the unserved load ratio, the required battery size, and the unmet thermal preference hours were adopted to quantify the impacts. Uncertainties from occupants&rsquo; thermal preferences and their impact on load scheduling are then studied and addressed through chance constraints. Generally, the proposed controller performs better in terms of the unmet thermal preference hours and the battery sizes compared to the deterministic controller.</p",

      "abstract": "The motivation of this work is to present an energy cost reduction concept in a home area power network (HAPN) with intelligent generation and flexible load demands. This study endeavors to address the energy management system (EMS) and layout-design challenges faced by HAPN through a systematic design approach. The growing demand for electricity has become a significant burden on traditional power networks, prompting power engineers to seek ways to improve their efficiency. One such solution is to integrate dispersed generation sources, such as photovoltaic (PV) and storage systems, with an appropriate control mechanism at the distribution level. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in interest in the installation of PV-Battery systems, due to their potential to reduce carbon emissions and lower energy costs. This research proposes an optimal economic power dispatch strategy using Model Predictive Control (MPC) to enhance the overall performance of HAPN. A hybrid AC/DC microgrid concept is proposed to address the control choices made by the appliance scheduling and hybrid switching approaches based on a linear programming optimization framework. The suggested optimization criteria improve consumer satisfaction, minimize grid disconnections, and lower overall energy costs by deploying inexpensive clean energy generation and control. Various examples from actual case study demonstrate the use of the established EMS and design methodology.Die Motivation dieser Arbeit besteht darin, ein Konzept zur Senkung der Energiekosten in einem Heimnetzwerk (HAPN) mit intelligenter Erzeugung und  exiblen Lastanforderungen vorzustellen. Im Rahmen dieser Forschungsarbeit wird ein Entwurf f\u00fcr ein HAPN entwickelt, indem das Energiemanagementsystem (EMS) und der Entwurf des Layouts auf der Grundlage des Systemmodells und der betrieblichen Anforderungen gel\u00f6st werden. Die steigende Nachfrage nach Elektrizit\u00e4t ist f\u00fcr traditionelle Stromnetze kostspielig und infrastrukturintensiv. Daher konzentrieren sich Energietechniker darauf, die Effizienz der derzeitigen Netze zu erh\u00f6hen. Dies kann durch die Integration verteilter Erzeugungsanlagen (z. B. Photovoltaik (PV), Speicher) mit einem geeigneten Kontrollmechanismus f\u00fcr das Energiemanagement auf der Verteilungsseite erreicht werden. Dar\u00fcber hinaus hat das Interesse an der Installation von PV-Batterie-basierten Systemen aufgrund der Reduzierung der CO2-Emissionen und der Senkung der Energiekosten erheblich zugenommen. Es wird eine optimale wirtschaftliche Strategie f\u00fcr den Energieeinsatz unter Verwendung einer modellpr\u00e4diktiven Steuerung (MPC) entwickelt. Es wird zudem ein hybrides AC/DC-Microgrid-Konzept vorgeschlagen, um die Steuerungsentscheidungen, die von den Ans\u00e4tzen der Ger\u00e4teplanung und der hybriden Umschaltung getroffen werden, auf der Grundlage eines linearen Programmierungsoptimierungsrahmens zu ber\u00fccksichtigen. Die vorgeschlagenen Optimierungskriterien verbessern die Zufriedenheit der Verbraucher, minimieren Netzabschaltungen und senken die Gesamtenergiekosten durch den Einsatz von kosteng\u00fcnstiger und sauberer Energieerzeugung. Verschiedene Beispiele aus einer Fallstudie demonstrieren den Einsatz des entwickelten EMS und der Entwurfsmethodik",

      "abstract": "In this work, a synchronverter-based control strategy is proposed to operate the STATCOM as a synchronous compensator. Moreover, to cope with unbalanced conditions that may appear at the grid, a novel voltage imbalance compensation control is developed to work harmoniously with the main synchronverter model. The used base synchronous generator model is derived from a general AC machine in space vector representation. Practical details about the controller design are addressed as well as a small-signal model for stability analysis and parameter tuning. Two scenarios are simulated: large-scale and small-scale system, the latter being used as a validation step for implementation in a small experimental setup.

      "title": "A Reserve-Based Method for Mitigating the Impact of Renewable Energy",
      "abstract": "The fundamental operating paradigm of today\\u27s power systems is undergoing a significant shift. This is partially motivated by the increased desire for incorporating variable renewable energy resources into generation portfolios. While these generating technologies offer clean energy at zero marginal cost, i.e. no fuel costs, they also offer unique operating challenges for system operators. Perhaps the biggest operating challenge these resources introduce is accommodating their intermittent fuel source availability. For this reason, these generators increase the system-wide variability and uncertainty. As a result, system operators are revisiting traditional operating strategies to more efficiently incorporate these generation resources to maximize the benefit they provide while minimizing the challenges they introduce.\nOne way system operators have accounted for system variability and uncertainty is through the use of operating reserves. Operating reserves can be simplified as excess capacity kept online during real time operations to help accommodate unforeseen fluctuations in demand. With new generation resources, a new class of operating reserves has emerged that is generally known as flexibility, or ramping, reserves. This new reserve class is meant to better position systems to mitigate severe ramping in the net load profile. The best way to define this new requirement is still under investigation. Typical requirement definitions focus on the additional uncertainty introduced by variable generation and there is room for improvement regarding explicit consideration for the variability they introduce. An exogenous reserve modification method is introduced in this report that can improve system reliability with minimal impacts on total system wide production costs.\nAnother potential solution to this problem is to formulate the problem as a stochastic programming problem. The unit commitment and economic dispatch problems are typically formulated as deterministic problems due to fast solution times and the solutions being sufficient for operations. Improvements in technical computing hardware have reignited interest in stochastic modeling. The variability of wind and solar naturally lends itself to stochastic modeling. The use of explicit reserve requirements in stochastic models is an area of interest for power system researchers. This report introduces a new reserve modification implementation based on previous results to be used in a stochastic modeling framework.\nWith technological improvements in distributed generation technologies, microgrids are currently being researched and implemented. Microgrids are small power systems that have the ability to serve their demand with their own generation resources and may have a connection to a larger power system. As battery technologies improve, they are becoming a more viable option in these distributed power systems and research is necessary to determine the most efficient way to utilize them. This report will investigate several unique operating strategies for batteries in small power systems and analyze their benefits. These new operating strategies will help reduce operating costs and improve system reliability",

      "abstract": "Emerging applications in Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems\n(CPS) present novel challenges to Big Data platforms for performing online\nanalytics. Ubiquitous sensors from IoT deployments are able to generate data\nstreams at high velocity, that include information from a variety of domains,\nand accumulate to large volumes on disk. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is\nrecognized as an important real-time computing paradigm for analyzing\ncontinuous data streams. However, existing work on CEP is largely limited to\nrelational query processing, exposing two distinctive gaps for query\nspecification and execution: (1) infusing the relational query model with\nhigher level knowledge semantics, and (2) seamless query evaluation across\ntemporal spaces that span past, present and future events. These allow\naccessible analytics over data streams having properties from different\ndisciplines, and help span the velocity (real-time) and volume (persistent)\ndimensions. In this article, we introduce a Knowledge-infused CEP (X-CEP)\nframework that provides domain-aware knowledge query constructs along with\ntemporal operators that allow end-to-end queries to span across real-time and\npersistent streams. We translate this query model to efficient query execution\nover online and offline data streams, proposing several optimizations to\nmitigate the overheads introduced by evaluating semantic predicates and in\naccessing high-volume historic data streams. The proposed X-CEP query model and\nexecution approaches are implemented in our prototype semantic CEP engine,\nSCEPter. We validate our query model using domain-aware CEP queries from a\nreal-world Smart Power Grid application, and experimentally analyze the\nbenefits of our optimizations for executing these queries, using event streams\nfrom a campus-microgrid IoT deployment.Comment: 34 pages, 16 figures, accepted in Future Generation Computer Systems,\n  October 27, 201",

      "title": "Occupant-Centric Modeling and Control for Low-Carbon and Resilient Communities",
      "abstract": "Global climate change and resulting frequent extreme weather events have highlighted the significance of energy sustainability and resilience. Communities, which refer to a group of buildings located geographically together, are important units for energy generation and consumption. Hence, the research of community energy sustainability and resilience has drawn much attention during the past decades. However, there remain many challenges surrounding community energy modeling and control to achieve the low-carbon and resilient goals.\nFirst, few tools are readily available for community-scale dynamic modeling and control-based studies. To address this gap, a community emulator was developed, which was designed to be hierarchical, scalable, and suitable for various applications. Data-driven stochastic building occupancy prediction was integrated into the emulator using logistic regression methods. Based on this work, we publicly released a library for net-zero energy community modeling using the object-oriented equation-based modeling language Modelica.\nSecond, building load control informed by real-time carbon emission signals is underdeveloped as utility price-driven control has so far been dominant. To better facilitate community energy sustainability through decarbonization, we proposed four rule-based carbon emission responsive building control algorithms to reduce the annual carbon emissions through thermostatically controllable loads. The impact of carbon net-metering, as well as the evolvement of the future energy generation mix, is analyzed on top of both momentary and predictive rules. Based on the simulation results, the average annual household carbon emissions are decreased by 6.0% to 20.5% compared to the baseline. The average annual energy consumption is increased by less than 6.7% due to more clean hours over the year. The annual energy cost change lies between -4.1% and 3.4% on top of the baseline.\nThird, the enhancement of community resilience in an islanded mode through optimal operation strategies is often faced with computational challenges given the large number of controllable loads. To tackle this, we proposed a two-layer model predictive control-based resource allocation and load scheduling framework for community resilience enhancement. Within this framework, the community operator layer optimally allocates the available PV generation to each building, while the building agent layer optimally schedules controllable loads to minimize the unserved load ratio while maintaining thermal comfort. We found that the allocation process is mostly constrained by the building load flexibility. More specifically, buildings with less load flexibility tend to be allocated more PV generation than other buildings. Further, we identified the competitive relationship between the objectives of minimizing unserved load ratio and maximize comfort. Therefore, it is necessary for the building agent to have multi-objective optimization.\nFinally, to account for the uncertainties of occupant behavior and its impact on resilient community load scheduling, we developed a preference-aware scheduler for resilient communities. Stochastic occupant thermostat-changing behavior models were introduced into the deterministic load scheduling framework as a source of uncertainty. KRIs such as the unserved load ratio, the required battery size, and the unmet thermal preference hours were adopted to quantify the impacts. Uncertainties from occupants&rsquo; thermal preferences and their impact on load scheduling are then studied and addressed through chance constraints. Generally, the proposed controller performs better in terms of the unmet thermal preference hours and the battery sizes compared to the deterministic controller.</p",

      "abstract": "The motivation of this work is to present an energy cost reduction concept in a home area power network (HAPN) with intelligent generation and flexible load demands. This study endeavors to address the energy management system (EMS) and layout-design challenges faced by HAPN through a systematic design approach. The growing demand for electricity has become a significant burden on traditional power networks, prompting power engineers to seek ways to improve their efficiency. One such solution is to integrate dispersed generation sources, such as photovoltaic (PV) and storage systems, with an appropriate control mechanism at the distribution level. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in interest in the installation of PV-Battery systems, due to their potential to reduce carbon emissions and lower energy costs. This research proposes an optimal economic power dispatch strategy using Model Predictive Control (MPC) to enhance the overall performance of HAPN. A hybrid AC/DC microgrid concept is proposed to address the control choices made by the appliance scheduling and hybrid switching approaches based on a linear programming optimization framework. The suggested optimization criteria improve consumer satisfaction, minimize grid disconnections, and lower overall energy costs by deploying inexpensive clean energy generation and control. Various examples from actual case study demonstrate the use of the established EMS and design methodology.Die Motivation dieser Arbeit besteht darin, ein Konzept zur Senkung der Energiekosten in einem Heimnetzwerk (HAPN) mit intelligenter Erzeugung und  exiblen Lastanforderungen vorzustellen. Im Rahmen dieser Forschungsarbeit wird ein Entwurf f\u00fcr ein HAPN entwickelt, indem das Energiemanagementsystem (EMS) und der Entwurf des Layouts auf der Grundlage des Systemmodells und der betrieblichen Anforderungen gel\u00f6st werden. Die steigende Nachfrage nach Elektrizit\u00e4t ist f\u00fcr traditionelle Stromnetze kostspielig und infrastrukturintensiv. Daher konzentrieren sich Energietechniker darauf, die Effizienz der derzeitigen Netze zu erh\u00f6hen. Dies kann durch die Integration verteilter Erzeugungsanlagen (z. B. Photovoltaik (PV), Speicher) mit einem geeigneten Kontrollmechanismus f\u00fcr das Energiemanagement auf der Verteilungsseite erreicht werden. Dar\u00fcber hinaus hat das Interesse an der Installation von PV-Batterie-basierten Systemen aufgrund der Reduzierung der CO2-Emissionen und der Senkung der Energiekosten erheblich zugenommen. Es wird eine optimale wirtschaftliche Strategie f\u00fcr den Energieeinsatz unter Verwendung einer modellpr\u00e4diktiven Steuerung (MPC) entwickelt. Es wird zudem ein hybrides AC/DC-Microgrid-Konzept vorgeschlagen, um die Steuerungsentscheidungen, die von den Ans\u00e4tzen der Ger\u00e4teplanung und der hybriden Umschaltung getroffen werden, auf der Grundlage eines linearen Programmierungsoptimierungsrahmens zu ber\u00fccksichtigen. Die vorgeschlagenen Optimierungskriterien verbessern die Zufriedenheit der Verbraucher, minimieren Netzabschaltungen und senken die Gesamtenergiekosten durch den Einsatz von kosteng\u00fcnstiger und sauberer Energieerzeugung. Verschiedene Beispiele aus einer Fallstudie demonstrieren den Einsatz des entwickelten EMS und der Entwurfsmethodik",

      "abstract": "In this work, a synchronverter-based control strategy is proposed to operate the STATCOM as a synchronous compensator. Moreover, to cope with unbalanced conditions that may appear at the grid, a novel voltage imbalance compensation control is developed to work harmoniously with the main synchronverter model. The used base synchronous generator model is derived from a general AC machine in space vector representation. Practical details about the controller design are addressed as well as a small-signal model for stability analysis and parameter tuning. Two scenarios are simulated: large-scale and small-scale system, the latter being used as a validation step for implementation in a small experimental setup.
