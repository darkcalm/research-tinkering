## Notes on Industry Search via CORE API
This summary provides an overview of academic papers retrieved using the CORE API, targeted with industry-focused search terms. The CORE API primarily indexes academic literature, so results will largely be scholarly articles, pre-prints, and conference papers that align with the industry-oriented queries. The scoring was adapted to de-emphasize purely academic metrics (like citation counts) and focus more on keyword relevance to industry topics.

This search complements broader industry research which might involve direct industry report searches, company website analysis, etc. For detailed information on retrieved items, refer to the consolidated JSON results file and individual query JSON files linked above.
