## Repository Structure

- `deliverable/` — LaTeX source, bibliography, and figures for the main research proposal
- `docs/` — Supplementary documentation, literature reviews, risk assessments, and planning
- `tools/` — Python scripts for literature analysis, visual planning, risk management, and data processing
- `sources/` — Data, reference mappings, and outputs from literature and risk analysis
- `tasks/` — Project management and task tracking (see `tasks/tasks-research-proposal.md`)
- `.cursor/` — **AI task management and automation rules**. Contains markdown rule files (in `.cursor/rules/`) that define how AI tools generate, manage, and process project task lists from the Product Requirements Document (PRD).

> **Note on AI Task Management**: Exact prompts and manual adjustments (fingerspitzengefuhl) are not recorded in the repository. Following the task list with the same AI prompting will yield considerably different results due to a lack of persistent alignment of intent.
