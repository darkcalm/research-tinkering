Task 5.2.1: Create Comprehensive Methodology Comparison Matrix (Updated)

Focus: Systematic comparison of identified methodologies for ACP/A2A protocol research.
Context: Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) and Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A) 
         for DER predictive maintenance coordination

Based on:
- Methodologies from docs/5.1.1-relevant-methodologies.json (consolidated from 5.1.1-5.1.5 tasks)
- Detailed KBs from 5.1.3 (Qualitative), 5.1.4 (Mixed), 5.1.5 (Emerging) updated scripts.
- Evaluation criteria and scoring adapted from archived 5.2.1 script.
