Task 5.1.4: Evaluate Mixed Methodologies (Updated)

Focus: Detailed evaluation of mixed research methodologies identified as relevant.
Context: Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) and Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A) 
         for DER predictive maintenance coordination

Based on:
- Relevant methodologies from docs/5.1.1-relevant-methodologies.json (newly generated)
- Internal knowledge base of mixed methodologies (adapted from archive)
- Considers integration with DSR (as primary quantitative) and Case Study (as potential qualitative)
