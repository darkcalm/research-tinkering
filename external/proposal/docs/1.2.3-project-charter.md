# Project Charter: Course Research Proposal

## Project Overview
**Project Name:** Research Proposal
**Course:** Methods of Research
**Component:** Research Proposal

## Project Purpose
To develop a comprehensive research proposal (**covering Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Research Process**) that demonstrates:
1.  Systematic literature survey capabilities (ILO1) - **aligned with background and additional literature review in Phases 1 and 2, including understanding the landscape of AI Agent Protocols.**
2.  Problem formulation and research question development (ILO2) - **aligned with defining the problem and formulating research questions in Phases 1 and 2, informed by the current state and future outlook of agent protocols.**
3.  Methodology comparison and selection (ILO3) - **aligned with surveying suitable methodologies and making motivated choices in Phase 2, considering methodologies relevant to agent protocol design and analysis.**
4.  Integration of ethics and sustainability considerations (ILO6) - **aligned with making assessments regarding relevant aspects.**
5.  Development of a structured research time plan - **aligned with making a time plan in Phase 2.**
6.  Assessment of project feasibility - **aligned with assessing project feasibility in Phase 2.**

**Leveraging Mentor Expertise:** Alignment with mentor expertise (see `docs/1.5-mentor-expertise.md`) is crucial for refining the research direction, selecting appropriate methodologies, and assessing project feasibility. The diverse backgrounds of the mentors in areas like energy systems analysis, AI in renewable energy, sustainable development, energy storage, and digitalization of energy can provide invaluable guidance, directly supporting the achievement of the project's purpose and ILOs.

## Project Scope

### In Scope (for Research Proposal - covering Phases 1 & 2)
- Development of a focused research proposal (~2000-3000 words)
- Two formative assignments with mentor feedback
- Final presentation and submission
- Individual reflection on group contribution
- Integration of ethics and sustainability aspects
- Development of structured research time plan
- Initial background research and problem definition (Phase 1)
- Additional literature review, research question/objective formulation, methodology selection, time planning, and feasibility assessment (Phase 2), **incorporating findings from the survey of AI Agent Protocols.**

### Out of Scope (for Research Proposal)
- Full literature review (this proposal serves as the plan for it)
- Detailed methodology implementation
- Data collection and analysis
- Production of research results (Phase 3)
- Final thesis writing and comprehensive delivery (Phase 4)

2.  **Formative Assignment 2 (FA2) - Research Plan Refinement (Phase 2 elements)**
   - Updated background (if needed)
   - Methodology discussion
   - Risk/uncertainty analysis
   - Due: May 9, 12:00

3.  **Final Proposal (Comprehensive Phase 1 & 2 documentation)**
   - Complete research proposal
   - ~2000-3000 words
   - Due: June 5, 19:00

4.  **Individual Reflection**
   - Personal contribution documentation
   - Improvement suggestions
   - Due: June 5, 19:00
