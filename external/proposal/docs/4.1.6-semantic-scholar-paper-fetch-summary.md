# Task 4.1.6: Fetch Relevant Semantic Scholar API Papers Summary

**Completion Date:** 2025-06-03 06:23:16  
**Script Used:** `tools/4.1.6_fetch_relevant_semantic_scholar_papers.py`  
**Input Scored Papers:** `sources/4.1.5-semantic-scholar-scored-papers/all_scored_papers_iter1-4.json` (253 papers)  
**Input Relevance Criteria:** `sources/4.1.3-relevance-criteria/relevance_criteria.json`  
**Output PDF Directory:** `sources/4.1.6-semantic-scholar-relevant-papers`  

## Process Overview

1. Loaded relevance criteria to determine the minimum relevance score for fetching.
2. Loaded all previously scored Semantic Scholar papers.
3. Filtered papers meeting the minimum overall relevance score threshold (>= 0.30).
4. For each relevant paper:
    a. Generated a standardized filename based on its title and DOI.
    b. Checked if a similar paper (by title or DOI) already existed in the output directory.
    c. If not existing, attempted to download the PDF, prioritizing `openAccessPdf` links from Semantic Scholar data, then using a multi-source search strategy (`Unpaywall`, `arXiv`, `CORE`).
5. Logged all successes, failures, and existing papers.

## Fetching Statistics

- **Total scored Semantic Scholar papers considered:** 253
- **Minimum relevance score for fetching:** 0.30
- **Number of papers meeting this relevance threshold:** 33
- **Number of download attempts made (for non-existing papers):** 25
- **Successfully downloaded new PDFs:** 0
- **Papers already existing in output directory (skipped download):** 8
- **Failed download attempts:** 25

## Notes

- The definition of "relevant" for this fetching task was based on the overall relevance score being >= 0.30.
- PDF discovery relied on `openAccessPdf` fields in Semantic Scholar data and a series of external services (Unpaywall, arXiv, CORE). The reliability of these services can vary.
- ResearchGate and Google Scholar search functions (commented out in `find_pdf_url`) were not used in this run to avoid potential instability from scraping. They can be enabled if necessary but may require more robust error handling or proxy setups.
- Filename normalization and existing paper checks were performed to avoid duplicates and ensure usability.

## Next Steps

- Review the downloaded PDFs in `sources/4.1.6-semantic-scholar-relevant-papers`.
- For papers that failed to download, manual searching might be required if they are critical.
- Proceed with Task 4.2 (Focused Literature Analysis), incorporating these fetched Semantic Scholar papers along with the Elicit papers.
