# Justify Exclusions (Task 3.5.4)

This document provides a clear justification for the elements that have been explicitly excluded from the research scope, as defined in `docs/3.2.3-define-scope.md` and `docs/3.5.1-define-boundaries.md`. The justification is based on the research objectives, constraints, and the need to maintain a focused and achievable scope within the Master's thesis timeframe.

## Excluded Elements and Justifications

### 1. Other Agent Communication Protocols

**Exclusion:** The research focuses exclusively on ACP and A2A, excluding other agent communication protocols.

**Justification:**
* **Focus and Depth:** Limiting the scope to two protocols allows for deeper analysis and more meaningful insights into their specific application in DER predictive maintenance.
* **Relevance:** ACP and A2A are emerging protocols with specific features relevant to our use case, as identified in the initial literature review.
* **Feasibility:** Including more protocols would exceed the time constraints of a Master's thesis while potentially diluting the quality of analysis.
* **Alignment with Objectives:** The research objectives specifically target understanding and adapting ACP and A2A, making other protocols unnecessary for achieving these goals.

### 2. Other DER Functions

**Exclusion:** The research is limited to predictive maintenance coordination, excluding other DER functions like energy trading or grid stability services.

**Justification:**
* **Problem Focus:** Predictive maintenance coordination presents a specific and well-defined communication challenge that can be effectively addressed within the thesis timeframe.
* **Complexity Management:** Each DER function has unique communication requirements; focusing on one function allows for thorough analysis.
* **Practical Relevance:** Predictive maintenance is a critical function that benefits from decentralized coordination, making it a suitable test case for the protocols.
* **Scope Containment:** Including multiple functions would require addressing different stakeholder interactions and communication patterns, exceeding the project's scope.

### 3. Full System Implementation

**Exclusion:** The research excludes full implementation and deployment of the proposed framework.

**Justification:**
* **Time Constraints:** A complete implementation would require significant development time beyond the thesis timeframe.
* **Resource Limitations:** Full implementation would require access to real DER systems and extensive testing infrastructure.
* **Focus on Design:** The primary contribution is the conceptual framework and protocol adaptation analysis, which can be validated through limited test cases.
* **Future Work:** Full implementation is better suited as a follow-up project, building upon the theoretical foundations established in this thesis.

### 4. Comprehensive Protocol Testing

**Exclusion:** While limited validation is included, comprehensive testing of all protocol features and scenarios is excluded.

**Justification:**
* **Scope Management:** Comprehensive testing would require extensive test cases and scenarios, exceeding the thesis timeframe.
* **Resource Efficiency:** Limited validation of key features provides sufficient confidence in the framework's applicability.
* **Focus on Core Features:** The research prioritizes testing the most relevant features for predictive maintenance coordination.
* **Theoretical Foundation:** The primary focus is on establishing a theoretical framework that can be validated through representative cases.

### 5. Detailed Security Protocol Design

**Exclusion:** While security considerations are included, detailed security protocol design is excluded.

**Justification:**
* **Specialized Domain:** Security protocol design is a specialized field that would require additional expertise and time.
* **Scope Alignment:** The research focuses on communication patterns and protocol adaptation rather than security implementation.
* **Existing Solutions:** The assumption is that existing security solutions can be integrated with the chosen protocols.
* **Conceptual Level:** Security considerations are addressed at a conceptual level, sufficient for the thesis objectives.

### 6. Business Model Analysis

**Exclusion:** Detailed analysis of business models and economic implications is excluded.

**Justification:**
* **Technical Focus:** The research primarily addresses technical aspects of protocol adaptation and communication.
* **Scope Containment:** Business model analysis would require additional expertise and research beyond the technical scope.
* **Future Consideration:** Economic aspects can be addressed in future work building upon the technical foundations.
* **Alignment with Objectives:** The research objectives focus on technical feasibility and protocol adaptation rather than economic viability.

### 7. Policy and Regulatory Analysis

**Exclusion:** Detailed analysis of policy implications and regulatory requirements is excluded.

**Justification:**
* **Technical Scope:** The research focuses on technical aspects of protocol adaptation and communication patterns.
* **Expertise Requirements:** Comprehensive policy analysis would require additional expertise in regulatory frameworks.
* **Future Work:** Policy implications can be addressed in future work building upon the technical foundations.
* **Alignment with Objectives:** The research objectives focus on technical feasibility rather than policy compliance.

## Conclusion

The exclusions are justified based on:
1. The need to maintain a focused and achievable scope within the Master's thesis timeframe
2. The primary research objectives focusing on technical aspects of protocol adaptation
3. The availability of resources and expertise
4. The potential for future work building upon the established foundations

These exclusions allow the research to maintain its focus on the core problem of adapting ACP and A2A for decentralized predictive maintenance coordination while ensuring the work is achievable within the given constraints.
