# Initial Search Protocol (Task 2.0)

## Research Problem Definition
- Core Issue: Gap between system-level best practices and individual DER devices

  - Focus on practical implementation challenges and solutions
  - Emphasis on scalability, security, and interoperability
  - Consideration of resource constraints and real-time requirements

**Link to ILOs (from Research):** This initial search protocol directly supports the achievement of several ILOs, particularly:
-   ILO 1 (Scientific Knowledge): By providing the foundation of current research and relevant methodology.
-   ILO 2 (Knowledge Integration and Identification): By guiding the search, gathering, and integration of knowledge.
-   ILO 3 (Handling Complexity): By identifying and analyzing complex phenomena in the literature.
-   ILO 6 (Assessment of Aspects): By considering ethical and sustainability implications in the literature.

### 3. Document Processing

**PDF to Markdown Conversion Method:**
PDF files without existing markdown versions were converted using a custom Python script (`tools/convert_pdf_to_md.py`) leveraging the PyMuPDF library for text extraction. The script iterates through PDF files in the `sources/literature/` directory and saves the output as `.md` files in the same location.

## Analysis of Existing Literature Coverage

This section analyzes the provided initial literature (`sources/initial_literature_input/`) against the defined search protocol to identify areas that may require more focused searching in Task 2.2.

**Analysis of Provided Documents:**

Based on the titles of the markdown files in `sources/initial_literature_input/`, the existing literature provides coverage in the following areas of the initial search protocol:

*   **Energy Domain Understanding (Phase 1):** Documents like "Coordination of resources at the edge of the electricity grid- systematic review and taxonomy.md", "An Overview of Distributed Energy Resource (DER) Interconnection- Current Practices and Emerging Solutions.md", and "Agent-Based Distributed Energy Resources for Supporting Intelligence at the Grid Edge.md" appear to cover challenges and integration of DERs.
*   **Best Practices in Energy (Phase 2):** Titles such as "Decentralized Coordination of Distributed Energy Resources through Local Energy Markets and Deep Reinforcement Learning.md" and "Multi-agent MPC protocols for micro- grid energy management and optimization.md" suggest coverage of coordination and management practices.
*   **Protocol Domain Analysis (Phase 3):** The document "A survey of agent interoperability protocols- Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A), and Agent Network Protocol (ANP).md" directly addresses the specific protocols of interest. **The new document "A Survey of AI Agent Protocols.md" provides a broader survey and taxonomy which is highly relevant to this phase.**
*   **Cross-Domain Application to Energy (Phase 4):** Titles like "GenTwin- Generative AI-powered Digital Twinning for Adaptive Management in IoT Networks.md" and potentially others related to digital twins or AI could touch upon cross-domain applications, although the direct application of the specific agent protocols (MCP, ACP, A2A) to energy in these documents would need to be verified through full-text review.
*   **Related Areas:** Some documents cover related but distinct areas like security ("A Comprehensive Survey on the Security of Smart Grid- Challenges, Mitigations, and Future Research Opportunities.md") and maintenance ("Systematic review of predictive maintenance and digital twin technologies challenges, opportunities, and best practices.md", "Photovoltaic systems operation and maintenance- A review and future directions.md"). While relevant, these may not directly address the core protocol-centric research gap.

**Prioritization for Task 2.2:**

Based on this preliminary analysis, while there is existing literature covering aspects of the energy and protocol domains, a focused search in Task 2.2 should prioritize:

1.  **Direct applications of MCP, ACP, and A2A in DER management or smart grids:**
    *   Combine protocol names with energy terms: `"MCP" AND ("DER management" OR "smart grid" OR "distributed energy resources")`
    *   Similarly for ACP and A2A: `"ACP" AND ("DER management" OR "smart grid" OR "distributed energy resources")`, `"A2A" AND ("DER management" OR "smart grid" OR "distributed energy resources")`
    *   Look for specific use cases: `("MCP" OR "ACP" OR "A2A") AND ("case study" OR "pilot project" OR "use case") AND ("energy" OR "power system")`

2.  **Detailed technical specifications and implementation details of MCP, ACP, and A2A, and their positioning within the broader AI Agent Protocol landscape:**
    *   Focus on technical aspects and taxonomy: `("MCP" OR "ACP" OR "A2A") AND ("specification" OR "implementation" OR "architecture" OR "design" OR "taxonomy" OR "classification" OR "evaluation")`
    *   Look for code/development: `("MCP" OR "ACP" OR "A2A") AND ("code" OR "repository" OR "development")`

3.  **Recent developments (2020-2025) on interoperability challenges and solutions in DER integration, considering the perspective of AI Agent Protocols:**
    *   Combine problem/solution with date range and protocol context: `("DER interoperability" OR "DER communication challenges") AND ("solution" OR "framework" OR "standard") AND ("agent protocol" OR "AI agent") AND (YEAR:2020 OR YEAR:2021 OR YEAR:2022 OR YEAR:2023 OR YEAR:2024 OR YEAR:2025)`
    *   Refine with scope: `("DER integration" OR "grid edge") AND ("interoperability" OR "communication") AND ("recent advances" OR "emerging solutions") AND ("agent protocol" OR "AI agent")`

The existing literature provides a good foundation, particularly the survey on agent interoperability protocols. The new survey on AI Agent Protocols provides an even stronger base by offering a systematic view of the landscape. Task 2.2 will involve systematically executing the full search strategy in the identified databases, paying special attention to finding documents that directly link the specific protocols (MCP, ACP, A2A) to DER management and address the identified research gap with empirical evidence or detailed technical analysis, while also considering the broader context of AI Agent Protocols.
