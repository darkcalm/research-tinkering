# Research Methodology Justification (Task 5.3.1)
*Generated: 2025-06-04T08:34:06.758332*
*Based on: 5.2.4 Feasibility Analysis and Perplexity Methodology Recommendations*

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive feasibility analysis and expert recommendations, this research will employ **Systematic Literature Review Methodology** as the primary methodology, enhanced with insights from protocol composition research. This approach balances academic rigor with practical deliverability within the 20-week thesis timeline.

## Feasibility Analysis Results

The comprehensive feasibility analysis of 25 research methodologies revealed the following top candidates:

| Rank | Methodology | Feasibility Score | Recommendation |
|------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 1 | Systematic Literature Review Methodology | 3.79 | Recommended |
| 2 | Comparative Research Methodology | 3.69 | Recommended |
| 3 | Rapid Prototyping & Iterative Development | 3.67 | Recommended |
| 4 | Action Research Methodology | 3.55 | Recommended |
| 5 | Grounded Theory Methodology | 3.46 | Recommended |

## Analysis of Expert Recommendations

### Design Science Research Recommendation
**Rationale:**
- Validated by Carrión & Pastor Digital Twin methodology review[^1]
- Three-step process aligns with DSR phases
- Supports HDT framework development
- Addresses standardization gap in DT methodologies

**Concerns:**
- High resource intensity and timeline requirements
- Ranked 20th in feasibility analysis (score 2.71)
- Recommendation is 'Use with Caution'
- May exceed 20-week thesis timeline

### Protocol Composition Approach
**Rationale:**
- Protocols work together rather than compete
- Focus on integration rather than selection
- More realistic representation of real-world usage
- Addresses gap in multi-protocol frameworks

**Concerns:**
- Expands scope beyond original ACP/A2A focus
- Adds MCP and ANP without clear justification
- May increase complexity beyond thesis scope
- No feasibility analysis for this novel approach

## Methodology Selection Justification

### Recommended Approach: Multi-phase methodology combining strengths

#### Phase 1: Systematic Literature Review
- **Methodology**: Systematic Literature Review Methodology
- **Focus**: Protocol composition patterns and integration approaches
- **Duration**: 6-8 weeks

#### Phase 2: Comparative Framework Development
- **Methodology**: Comparative Research Methodology
- **Focus**: ACP vs A2A analysis with composition considerations
- **Duration**: 8-10 weeks

#### Phase 3: Proof of Concept
- **Methodology**: Rapid Prototyping
- **Focus**: Protocol integration demonstration
- **Duration**: 4-6 weeks

### Advantages of This Approach
- Leverages top-feasible methodologies
- Incorporates Perplexity insights without scope explosion
- Maintains focus on ACP/A2A while considering integration
- Provides multiple validation approaches

## Risk Management and Mitigation

- **Scope Management**: Maintain focus on ACP/A2A core objectives
- **Timeline Control**: Use rapid prototyping for proof-of-concept only
- **Complexity Management**: Limit protocol composition analysis to ACP/A2A integration
- **Quality Assurance**: Regular milestone reviews and supervisor feedback

## Conclusion

The selected hybrid methodology approach provides optimal balance between:
- **Academic Rigor**: Systematic literature review and comparative analysis
- **Practical Feasibility**: High feasibility scores and proven implementation
- **Innovation**: Integration of protocol composition insights
- **Deliverability**: Realistic timeline and resource requirements

This approach ensures the research contributes novel insights while maintaining the quality and rigor expected of a Master's thesis.
