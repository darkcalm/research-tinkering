- Discussion and motivation of:
  - Objective/research question
  - Scope/limitations

### FA2 (May 9)
- Potential updates to FA1 content based on feedback
- Discussion of possible methodologies
- Motivation for chosen methodology
- Discussion of uncertainties and risks

## Final Deliverables
1. Group Proposal (~2000 words)
   - Must incorporate feedback from mentors and peers

2. Individual Reflection
   - Document unique contribution to group work
   - Suggest improvements based on seminar presentations

## Mandatory Requirements
- On-time submission of all deliverables
- Active participation in peer-review exercise
- Documentation of unique contribution to group work

## Implementation Strategy
We should aim to meet BOTH A-grade requirements to ensure highest quality:

1. **Ethics and Sustainability**
   - Integrate throughout the proposal
   - Address in each major section
   - Include specific examples
   - Link to broader context
   - Show practical application

2. **Time Planning**
   - Create detailed Gantt chart
   - Include all deadlines
   - Plan for feedback cycles
   - Account for revisions
   - Show clear progression

## Success Criteria
The proposal will be considered A-grade if it:
1. Meets all C-grade requirements comprehensively
2. Successfully implements at least one A-grade requirement
3. Shows clear evidence of thorough planning
4. Demonstrates academic rigor
5. Maintains consistency throughout

## Notes
- Late submissions will affect final grade
- Two mentor sessions scheduled:
  - April 14, 10-12 (Zoom)
  - May 8, 10-12 (Zoom)
- Aim to meet both A-grade requirements for highest quality
- Regular review against requirements
- Document evidence of compliance 

## Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs) from __.md

The `__.md` document outlines the Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs) for the program that the research project must demonstrate. Achieving these outcomes is crucial for different grades. The ILOs cover:

1.  **Scientific Knowledge:** Demonstrating knowledge of the subject area's scientific grounds, current research, development, and relevant methodology, with in-depth insight.
2.  **Knowledge Integration and Identification:** Ability to search for, gather, and integrate knowledge, identify the need for additional knowledge with a holistic, critical, and systematic approach.
3.  **Handling Complexity:** Ability to identify, analyze, assess, and handle complex phenomena, questions, and situations, even with limited information.
4.  **Planning and Execution:** Ability to plan and carry out skilled tasks with adequate methods within a given timeframe and evaluate the work.
5.  **Communication:** Capacity to clearly account for and discuss conclusions and their basis (knowledge and arguments) orally and in writing, in dialogue with different groups.
6.  **Assessment of Aspects:** Ability to make assessments regarding relevant scientific, social, and ethical aspects.
7.  **R&D Participation / Independent Work:** Demonstrating the skills required to participate in research and development work or to independently work in other skilled activities.

For a successful research (Pass), the work must adequately demonstrate these ILOs as detailed in the course material. Achieving higher grades (A-grade) requires demonstrating a more advanced and in-depth fulfillment of these outcomes, as previously analyzed in this document.

**Relevance of Mentor Expertise:** The research expertise of the assigned mentors (see `docs/1.5-mentor-expertise.md`) is highly relevant to achieving the ILOs, particularly ILOs 1 (Scientific Knowledge), 2 (Knowledge Integration), and 3 (Handling Complexity). Mentors with expertise in areas such as energy systems analysis, AI in renewable energy, sustainable development, energy storage, and digitalization of energy can provide valuable guidance on research direction, methodology selection, and the assessment of scientific, social, and ethical aspects (ILO 6). Aligning the research topic and methodology with mentor expertise can significantly enhance the quality and feasibility of the project, contributing to a higher grade.
