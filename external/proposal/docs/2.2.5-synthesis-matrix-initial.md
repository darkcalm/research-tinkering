# Initial Literature Synthesis Matrix (Task 2.2.5)

This matrix is used to consolidate key findings and extracted data from the preliminary literature review to facilitate analysis and synthesis.

**Instructions:**
Populate this matrix by reviewing the markdown files in `sources/initial_literature_search/` and extracting relevant information based on the search protocol's analysis framework.

| Document (Title, Author, Year) | Key Findings (DER Management) | Key Findings (Protocols: MCP, ACP, A2A) | Methodology | Cross-Domain Applicability to Energy | Relevance to Research Gap | Notes/Potential Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Analysis and Synthesis Notes:**

[Use this section to write notes on patterns, contradictions, significant findings, or areas requiring further investigation based on the populated matrix. **Explicitly consider the AI Agent Protocol taxonomy (context-oriented vs. inter-agent, general-purpose vs. domain-specific) and evaluation dimensions (efficiency, scalability, security, reliability, extensibility, operability, interoperability) as discussed in "A Survey of AI Agent Protocols.md".**]

**Note on ILOs and Mentor Expertise:** When analyzing and synthesizing the literature in this matrix, consider how the findings contribute to addressing the thesis ILOs (see `sources/1.0-course_material/Course The Master Thesis Research.md`) and their relevance to the research expertise of the assigned mentors (see `docs/1.0.5-mentor-expertise.md`). This will help in identifying literature that strongly supports the thesis requirements and potential areas of mentor guidance.
