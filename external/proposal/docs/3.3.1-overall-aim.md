## Overall Aim
 
The overall aim of this research is to investigate and conceptually design how emerging agent communication protocols, specifically Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) and Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A), can be applied and adapted to enable secure, scalable, and interoperable communication for decentralized predictive maintenance coordination among diverse Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) owned and operated by different entities, and to develop a quantitative framework for evaluating their performance in this context.
