# Research Assumptions (Task 3.5.3)

This document outlines the key assumptions underlying the research project, which are taken as true or certain in the context of the defined scope (`docs/3.2.3-define-scope.md`), boundaries (`docs/3.5.1-define-boundaries.md`), and identified constraints (`docs/3.5.2-identify-constraints.md`). These assumptions are necessary to make the research feasible and manageable within the constraints of a Master's thesis.

## Underlying Assumptions

The following assumptions are made for the purpose of this research proposal:

*   **Availability of Information:** It is assumed that sufficient relevant literature exists regarding DER predictive maintenance, agent-based systems in energy, and the specifications/features of ACP and A2A protocols to conduct a meaningful conceptual analysis and design. While data accessibility for empirical work is a constraint, information for theoretical analysis is assumed to be available through academic databases and public documentation.
*   **Protocol Suitability (Conceptual):** It is assumed that ACP and A2A, as agent communication protocols, possess fundamental characteristics that make them conceptually suitable for facilitating communication patterns required in decentralized DER predictive maintenance, even if adaptations are needed. The research will investigate this suitability, but the underlying assumption is that they are viable candidates worth exploring.
*   **Generality of Requirements:** Given the constraint of not covering all DER types, it is assumed that the communication requirements identified for decentralized predictive maintenance have a sufficient level of generality across diverse DER types and ownership models to inform a broadly applicable conceptual framework.
*   **Independence of Algorithm:** It is assumed that the conceptual communication framework and messaging patterns can be designed and analyzed largely independently of the specific predictive maintenance algorithms used by individual DERs or maintenance providers. The focus is on the communication infrastructure supporting data exchange for such algorithms.
*   **Conceptual Focus Validity:** It is assumed that a conceptual analysis and design, without full implementation or empirical testing, is a valid and valuable contribution for a Master's thesis in this context, providing a foundational understanding and framework for future, more empirical work.
*   **Ethical and Security Framework Existence:** While detailed ethical and security protocol design is out of scope, it is assumed that existing ethical guidelines (e.g., [REDACTED]'s) and general security principles can be conceptually applied to the design, and that robust technical security solutions *can* be integrated with the chosen protocols if needed in a real-world implementation (even if not designed in detail here).
*   **Stakeholder Roles:** It is assumed that the general roles and interactions between key stakeholders (DER owners, maintenance providers, grid operators) in a decentralized predictive maintenance scenario can be reasonably characterized based on existing literature and domain understanding for the purpose of conceptual design.
*   **Evaluation Framework Assumptions:** It is assumed that:
    *   Sufficient literature exists on protocol evaluation methodologies that can be adapted for energy applications
    *   The identified metrics and evaluation criteria will be applicable across different DER types and ownership models
    *   A simplified test case can be implemented within the thesis timeframe to validate key aspects of the framework
    *   The results from limited validation will provide meaningful insights into the framework's practical applicability
    *   The validation results can be generalized to some extent to other scenarios
    *   The developed framework will be consistent with existing evaluation methodologies while addressing energy-specific needs

These assumptions define the framework within which the research is conducted and mitigate the impact of certain constraints. They will be revisited if necessary during the research process if evidence suggests they are not valid.
