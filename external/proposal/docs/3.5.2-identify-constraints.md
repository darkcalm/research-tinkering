# Research Constraints (Task 3.5.2)

This document identifies and outlines the key constraints that will impact the research project, building upon the defined scope (`docs/3.2.3-define-scope.md`) and boundaries (`docs/3.5.1-define-boundaries.md`). Recognizing these constraints is essential for ensuring the feasibility and realistic planning of the research within the thesis timeframe.

## Identified Constraints

The research project is subject to the following key constraints:

*   **Time Constraint:** The primary constraint is the limited timeframe of a Master's thesis, typically around 20 weeks. This necessitates a focused scope and limits the depth and breadth of empirical work that can be undertaken.
*   **Resource Constraints:** Available resources may include access to specific databases for literature search, computational resources (though limited for conceptual work), and access to expertise (primarily through academic supervisors and available literature).
*   **Scope and Boundary Constraints:** As defined in `docs/3.2.3-define-scope.md` and `docs/3.5.1-define-boundaries.md`, the research is constrained to:
    *   A **conceptual level** of analysis and design (no full implementation or testing).
    *   Focus specifically on **ACP and A2A** protocols.
    *   Focus specifically on the **predictive maintenance coordination** use case.
    *   Reliance on **literature review and theoretical analysis** as the primary basis for evaluation.
    *   Development of a **quantitative evaluation framework** with limited validation through simplified test cases.
*   **Data Accessibility:** Obtaining real-world, high-resolution predictive maintenance data from diverse, multi-owner DER fleets is often challenging due to privacy concerns, proprietary systems, and lack of standardized data sharing platforms. The research design must acknowledge this and rely on publicly available information, hypothetical scenarios, or generalized requirements.
*   **Complexity of Decentralized Systems:** The inherent complexity of decentralized, multi-owner DER ecosystems with heterogeneous technologies and varying operational practices poses a constraint on developing a universally applicable conceptual design without significant generalization.
*   **Knowledge Limitations:** While the project involves a literature review, the depth of expertise on highly specific technical details of all DER types or the latest advancements in ACP/A2A implementations may be limited within the thesis scope and requires careful management of information gathering.
*   **Evaluation Framework Constraints:** The development and validation of the quantitative evaluation framework is constrained by:
    *   Limited availability of standardized metrics for protocol evaluation in energy applications
    *   Need to focus on simplified test cases that can be implemented within the thesis timeframe
    *   Requirement to maintain consistency with existing evaluation methodologies while addressing energy-specific needs
    *   Necessity to balance validation depth with available time and resources
    *   Focus on validating key metrics rather than comprehensive testing

Identifying these constraints early helps in shaping the research design and methodology to be realistic and achievable within the given limitations. They will also inform the documentation of limitations in Task 3.5.5.
