# Specific Research Objectives (Task 3.3.2)

This document outlines the specific research objectives that break down the overall research aim (Task 3.3.1) into actionable steps and address the specific research problem (Task 3.2.1) within the defined scope (Task 3.2.3). The objectives are developed based on the selected research direction (Task 3.1.2) and are intended to be measurable and achievable within the thesis timeframe.

## Specific Objectives

The specific objectives of this research are:

1.  **To analyze** the communication requirements for decentralized predictive maintenance coordination among diverse distributed energy resources (DERs) owned and operated by different entities.
2.  **To investigate** the key features and capabilities of Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) and Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A) relevant to fulfilling these communication requirements.
3.  **To design** a conceptual framework illustrating how ACP and/or A2A can be applied to facilitate the defined communication patterns for DER predictive maintenance.
4.  **To specify** core messaging patterns and information exchange requirements using ACP and/or A2A primitives and concepts for DER health data exchange and maintenance task initiation.
5.  **To develop** a quantitative evaluation framework for assessing the performance of ACP and A2A in DER predictive maintenance scenarios, identifying relevant metrics and evaluation criteria through literature review.

These objectives collectively aim to provide a conceptual design and analysis of using emerging agent communication protocols for a critical function in decentralized energy systems, thereby contributing to the overall research aim.
