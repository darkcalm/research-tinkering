# Research Scope (Task 3.2.3)

This document defines the scope and boundaries of the research problem articulated in `docs/3.2.1-specific-problem.md`, based on the selected research direction (`docs/3.1.2-research-direction-selection.md`) and considering feasibility for a 20-week Master's thesis.

## Scope Definition

The scope of this research is carefully defined to provide a focused and manageable investigation into the application and adaptation of specific agent communication protocols for a key function within the decentralized energy landscape. The scope balances the need to address a significant problem with the practical constraints of a Master's thesis project.

**In Scope:**

*   **Primary Focus:** Investigating the application and adaptation of **Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)** and **Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A)** for enabling key communication flows required for **predictive maintenance coordination** among distributed energy resources (DERs) owned and operated by different entities. This includes analyzing their features and capabilities relevant to this use case.

*   **Quantitative Framework Design:** Developing a structured framework for measuring and comparing ACP and A2A performance in DER predictive maintenance scenarios. This will involve:
    - Literature review to identify relevant performance metrics and evaluation methodologies
    - Development of benchmark scenarios based on DER maintenance requirements
    - Establishment of evaluation criteria through analysis of protocol specifications
    - Design of comparison methodology for systematic protocol assessment

*   **Protocol Performance Analysis:** Conducting theoretical analysis of protocol performance based on documented specifications and literature. The specific aspects of performance to be analyzed will be determined through literature review, potentially including:
    - Performance characteristics relevant to maintenance scenarios
    - Scalability considerations for multi-owner DER fleets
    - Security and reliability features
    - Interoperability requirements

*   **Conceptual Framework Design:** Designing a framework illustrating how ACP and/or A2A can be used to facilitate the defined communication patterns in a multi-owner DER predictive maintenance context, including:
    - Agent roles and interaction patterns
    - Performance requirements and constraints
    - Integration points with existing systems
    - Scalability considerations

*   **Messaging Pattern Specification:** Specifying core messaging patterns and information exchange requirements using ACP and/or A2A primitives, including:
    - Message structure and format specifications
    - Performance characteristics and constraints
    - Error handling and recovery mechanisms
    - Security and privacy considerations

*   **Justification of Protocol Suitability:** Providing a reasoned justification for the suitability of ACP and A2A based on:
    - Quantitative performance analysis
    - Feature comparison against requirements
    - Scalability assessment
    - Security and reliability evaluation

*   **Literature Review:** Conducting a focused literature review covering:
    - DER predictive maintenance requirements
    - Agent-based energy systems
    - ACP and A2A technical specifications
    - Performance evaluation methodologies
    - Industry standards and best practices

*   **Ethical and Sustainability Considerations:** Identifying and discussing:
    - Data privacy and security implications
    - Resource efficiency and environmental impact
    - Grid reliability contributions
    - Social and economic sustainability aspects

*   **Feasibility Assessment:** Evaluating the practical implementation of the proposed framework, including:
    - Resource requirements
    - Technical constraints
    - Integration challenges
    - Performance limitations

**Out of Scope:**

*   **Full System Implementation:** Actual software development, coding, or implementation of agents, protocols, or a complete end-to-end predictive maintenance system. The focus is on conceptual design, specification, and theoretical performance analysis.

*   **Algorithm Development:** Development or detailed evaluation of specific predictive maintenance algorithms. The research focuses on the communication infrastructure needed to support these algorithms.

*   **Large-Scale Testing:** Conducting extensive simulations, laboratory testbed experiments, or field deployments. Performance analysis will be based on theoretical properties, documented specifications, and literature.

*   **Coverage of All DER Types:** While considering general communication requirements, the research will not provide detailed technical analysis for every possible DER type.

*   **Coverage of All Agent Protocols:** The focus is specifically on ACP and A2A, not a comprehensive comparison of all possible agent protocols.

*   **Detailed Security Implementation:** While security aspects will be considered conceptually, detailed cryptographic protocol implementation is out of scope.

*   **Policy or Regulatory Analysis:** In-depth analysis of specific energy policies or regulations is outside the primary focus.

*   **Business Model Analysis:** Detailed analysis of business models for predictive maintenance services is not included.

*   **Human-Agent Interface Design:** Detailed design of user interfaces for human operators is out of scope.

This defined scope ensures the research is focused, manageable within the thesis timeframe, and directly addresses the core problem of enabling predictive maintenance communication in multi-owner DER fleets using emerging agent protocols through conceptual design, quantitative analysis, and theoretical performance evaluation.
