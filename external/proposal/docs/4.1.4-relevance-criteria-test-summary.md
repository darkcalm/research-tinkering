## Overview

This document summarizes the results of testing the relevance criteria (developed in Task 4.1.3) against a sample of papers from Elicit.com (markdown format) and Semantic Scholar (JSON results). The goal was to perform an initial validation of the criteria's ability to distinguish relevant literature based on keyword matching and weighted dimensions.

## Initial Assessment and Observations

**Scoring Logic:**
The current scoring is based on keyword presence within the combined text (title, abstract, TLDR for Semantic Scholar; cleaned full text for Elicit markdown).
- Year, venue quality, and citation count scoring are currently simplified for this test (default scores assigned). A full implementation would require parsing this metadata accurately.
- Keyword matches are weighted simply by presence; more advanced NLP techniques (e.g., TF-IDF, embeddings) were not used in this initial test.

**Effectiveness of Criteria:**
- (TODO: Add manual assessment here after reviewing the scores. How well do the scores align with intuitive relevance? Are keywords effective? Are weights appropriate?)
- (TODO: Identify any obvious false positives or false negatives based on the sample.)
- (TODO: Assess if the dimensions capture relevance adequately.)

**Potential Refinements based on this Test:**
- **Keyword List:** Review and expand/refine keyword lists for each subcriterion. Some important terms might be missing, or some might be too broad/narrow.
- **Weighting:** Adjust weights for dimensions and subcriteria if scores seem misaligned with perceived relevance.
- **Year/Quality Scoring:** Implement more robust parsing of publication year and potentially integrate with external APIs or local databases for venue/citation data if feasible for a more automated quality assessment.
- **Negative Keywords:** Consider adding negative keywords for exclusion if certain themes consistently lead to irrelevant results.
- **Scoring Algorithm:** Explore more sophisticated text matching or NLP techniques if basic keyword matching proves insufficient. For example, consider stemming or lemmatization.
- **Contextual Analysis:** For markdown papers, the current text extraction is basic. More advanced parsing to identify sections (abstract, introduction, conclusion) could allow for more targeted keyword application (e.g., higher weight for keywords in abstract/conclusion).

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Review of Test Results:** Thoroughly analyze the scores and matched keywords for each sample paper to assess the criteria's performance.
2. **Refine Criteria:** Based on the manual review, update `sources/4.1.3-relevance-criteria/relevance_criteria.json` (and re-run Task 4.1.3 script if structure changes significantly).
3. **Re-test (Optional):** If major changes are made to criteria, re-run this test script with the updated criteria.
4. **Proceed to Task 4.1.5:** Implement Semantic Scholar API papers storage, incorporating the refined relevance scoring.
5. **Proceed to Task 4.2.1:** Apply criteria systematically to all Elicit and Semantic Scholar papers.

This initial test provides valuable insights into the practical application of the relevance criteria and highlights areas for potential improvement before full-scale literature screening.
