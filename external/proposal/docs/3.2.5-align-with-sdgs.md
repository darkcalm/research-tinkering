# Alignment with SDGs (Task 3.2.5)

This document details how the specific research problem, as articulated in `docs/3.2.1-specific-problem.md` and connected to sustainability in `docs/3.2.4-connect-to-sustainability.md`, aligns with relevant United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This demonstrates the broader impact and relevance of the research, contributing to ILO4 and A-grade criteria.

## Alignment with Sustainable Development Goals

The research problem, focusing on enabling secure, scalable, and interoperable communication for decentralized predictive maintenance coordination among diverse DERs using emerging agent communication protocols, aligns primarily with the following SDGs:

1.  **SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy**
    *   **Target 7.2: Increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix:** Reliable and efficiently maintained DERs are crucial for increasing the generation and utilization of renewable energy. By improving the effectiveness of predictive maintenance, the research helps ensure DERs contribute optimally to the energy mix, supporting this target.
    *   **Target 7.3: Double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency:** Predictive maintenance helps ensure DERs operate efficiently, minimizing energy losses and maximizing their output relative to input. This contributes to overall energy system efficiency improvements.
    *   **Target 7.1: Ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services:** While not a direct focus, reliable DER operation supported by effective maintenance contributes to energy security and can potentially improve energy access, particularly in decentralized or off-grid contexts.

2.  **SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure**
    *   **Target 9.1: Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure:** The research contributes to the development of the communication infrastructure necessary for managing decentralized DERs effectively. This infrastructure is key to building a resilient and sustainable energy system.
    *   **Target 9.4: Upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and processes:** The application of emerging agent protocols represents an innovation in communication technology for the energy sector, supporting the adoption of clean technologies (DERs) and promoting resource efficiency through predictive maintenance.
    *   **Target 9.5: Enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors... and encourage innovation and diversification:** The research contributes to scientific understanding of agent communication protocols in the energy domain and promotes innovation in DER management technologies.

By addressing the communication challenges for DER predictive maintenance, the research supports the expansion and reliable operation of renewable energy infrastructure (SDG 7), promotes innovation in energy management technologies, and contributes to building resilient energy infrastructure (SDG 9). This explicit alignment demonstrates the research's contribution to global sustainability efforts, fulfilling a key requirement of the course and strengthening the proposal's impact and relevance.
