## 1. Objective of this Search Strategy

The primary objective of this Elicit.com search strategy is to systematically identify literature that will help pinpoint:
1.  **Theoretical Gaps:** Missing links, underdeveloped concepts, or unaddressed theoretical questions related to Human DER Worker Digital Twins (HDTs), agent communication protocols in this context, and the integration of human expertise into digital twin frameworks for DERs.
2.  **Methodological Limitations:** Shortcomings or underexplored research methodologies in studying the development, implementation, and evaluation of HDTs or similar human-centric AI systems in operational environments.
3.  **Practical Needs:** Unmet challenges or requirements in the DER industry concerning the management of human expertise, human-system interaction, operator support, and the adoption of advanced digital tools like DTs and AI agents.

This targeted search aims to collect evidence that will inform the formulation of a strong research gap statement (Task 4.3.7), building upon the existing literature synthesized in `docs/4.2.1.1-identify-patterns-trends-preliminary.md` and directly supporting the refined research questions (RQs) and hypotheses (Hs) in `docs/4.2.4.1` and `docs/4.2.4.2`.

## 2. Relationship to Existing Research & Visual Model

This search is not starting from scratch. It builds upon:
- The **conceptual model** (`docs/4.2.3-visual-representation.tex`), focusing on the interactions between the Human DER Worker (HEW), the Digital Twin Worker (DTW), the Application Context (AC), and the Evaluation Context (EC).
- The **refined RQs and Hs**, which already point towards areas needing deeper investigation (e.g., tacit knowledge capture, protocol adaptation, evaluation frameworks).
- The **preliminary literature review** (`docs/4.2.1.1`), which has identified key papers by Ehtesham et al. (2025) on agent protocols, Ma et al. (2024) and Abd Wahab et al. (2024) on Digital Twins and PMx, Carvalho et al. (2007) on operator communication, Chen et al. (2017) on operator support, and Starke et al. (2022) & Veith (2017) on DER agents.

This search will use Elicit.com's capabilities to ask questions directly related to the RQs and Hs, seeking papers that critically discuss limitations, challenges, open questions, and future work in these specific areas.

- Papers proposing novel theoretical frameworks or methodologies that aim to address known gaps in HDTs, agent-based systems for human modeling, or DTs in DERs.
- Recent publications (e.g., last 5-7 years) to capture the current state of the art and identified gaps, but also seminal papers if they highlight foundational, still-unresolved issues.
- Papers from reputable conferences and journals in AI, multi-agent systems, digital twins, human factors, and energy informatics.
- Review papers, systematic literature reviews, and position papers are of high interest if they synthesize gaps.

**Exclusion Criteria:**
- Papers that only describe a specific implementation without critical reflection on limitations or future needs.
- Papers heavily focused on purely technical aspects of DERs (e.g., hardware, power electronics) without a clear link to human expertise, AI agents, or digital twins in that context.

## 6. Search Process and Documentation

1.  **Iterative Queries:** Execute the search queries listed in Section 4. Analyze results. Refine queries or add new ones based on initial findings and Elicit's suggestions.
2.  **Elicit Features:** Utilize Elicit's "summary of top papers," "concepts," and "abstracts" to quickly assess relevance to gap identification.
3.  **Column Customization:** Add columns in Elicit for "Limitations Discussed," "Future Work Mentioned," "Methodology Critiqued," "Theoretical Gaps Identified."
4.  **Export:** Export relevant papers' information (including abstracts and potentially Elicit's summary of key points related to gaps/limitations) as CSV. This will be processed in Task 4.3.2.
5.  **Log:** Maintain a log of queries used and their perceived effectiveness in `docs/4.3.1-elicit-search-strategy-gap-analysis.md` (this document, possibly in an appendix or a separate linked log file if it becomes extensive).

## 7. Expected Output from this Strategy (leading to Task 4.3.2 & 4.3.3)

The execution of this strategy (Task 4.3.2 & 4.3.3) is expected to yield a curated list of papers, along with their abstracts and relevant excerpts (facilitated by Elicit.com features), that directly speak to the theoretical, methodological, and practical gaps in the research area of HDTs for DERs. This curated information will be essential for tasks 4.3.4, 4.3.5, 4.3.6, and ultimately 4.3.7.

This strategy will be iterative. Insights from initial searches may lead to refining keywords, queries, or even identifying new themes for gap exploration.
