## Scoring Methodology

### Inclusion Thresholds
- **Minimum Score:** 0.3 - Papers must achieve minimum 0.3 weighted score across all dimensions
- **Core Concept Requirement:** 0.2 - Papers must score at least 0.2 in core concepts dimension

### Keyword Matching
- **Title Match:** 2x weight
- **Abstract Match:** 1x weight
- **Keyword Match:** 0.5x weight

### Manual Assessment
Relevance to research questions and framework validation needs

## Application Strategy

### Phase 1: Automated Screening
1. Apply keyword matching across all dimensions
2. Calculate weighted scores for each paper
3. Filter papers meeting minimum thresholds
4. Rank papers by total relevance score

### Phase 2: Manual Review
1. Review borderline cases (scores 0.25-0.35)
2. Validate high-scoring papers for quality
3. Apply exclusion criteria
4. Final relevance classification

### Phase 3: Documentation
1. Document evaluation results
2. Categorize papers by relevance level
3. Identify gaps in literature coverage
4. Prepare recommendations for additional searches

## Validation Requirements

These criteria support the literature validation needs identified in the theoretical framework:

1. **Concept Validation:** Verify alignment with established practices in DER maintenance and agent protocols
2. **Relationship Validation:** Confirm theoretical framework relationships through literature evidence
3. **Gap Identification:** Identify areas where literature support is limited
4. **Framework Refinement:** Guide updates to theoretical framework based on literature findings

## Next Steps

1. **Task 4.1.4:** Test these criteria against sample papers
2. **Task 4.1.5:** Implement Semantic Scholar API papers storage with relevance scoring
3. **Task 4.2.1:** Apply criteria to review all papers from Elicit.com and Semantic Scholar
4. **Task 4.2.2:** Use results for theoretical framework validation
