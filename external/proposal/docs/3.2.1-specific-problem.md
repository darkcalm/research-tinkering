# Specific Research Problem (Task 3.2.1)

This document articulates the specific research problem addressed in the thesis proposal, based on the selected research direction (Task 3.1.2) and initial problem exploration (Task 2.3).

## Problem Articulation

The increasing deployment of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), such as rooftop solar, battery storage, and electric vehicles, is transforming the energy landscape. However, the decentralized nature of DER ownership and operation presents significant challenges for effective grid management, particularly concerning maintenance. Traditional centralized maintenance approaches are often inefficient and poorly suited for diverse, geographically dispersed DER fleets managed by various entities (e.g., homeowners, businesses, third-party aggregators).

A critical aspect of managing these decentralized DERs is ensuring their reliable and efficient operation through timely and predictive maintenance. Predictive maintenance relies on the ability to collect and analyze real-time or near-real-time health data from DERs and initiate maintenance tasks proactively before failures occur. This requires seamless, secure, and interoperable communication among the DERs themselves, their owners/operators, and maintenance service providers.

The specific problem this research addresses is: **How can emerging agent communication protocols, particularly Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) and Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A), be applied and adapted to enable secure, scalable, and interoperable communication for decentralized predictive maintenance coordination among diverse Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) owned and operated by different entities?**

This problem highlights the need for novel communication approaches that can overcome the limitations of traditional centralized systems in a decentralized, multi-stakeholder DER ecosystem. It focuses on the potential of agent-based communication to facilitate the necessary data exchange and task coordination for effective predictive maintenance in this complex environment.
