The identified limitations provide strong methodological justification for the proposed research approach and demonstrate how the chosen methodology addresses significant gaps in current research practices within HDT-related domains.

## References to Gap Analysis Strategy

This analysis aligns with the methodological gap identification strategy outlined in `docs/4.3.1-elicit-search-strategy-gap-analysis.md`, specifically addressing:

- Shortcomings in research methodologies for studying HDT development and implementation

- Limited methodological integration across the technical and human factors domains essential to HDT development

These limitations provide comprehensive support for the proposed research methodology and demonstrate the significant methodological contributions the research will make to multiple interconnected research domains.
