- **Key Phases (from KB)**:
  - *Strategic selection of cases for investigation:* (Timeline: 2-3 weeks)
  - *Collect multiple forms of evidence from selected cases:* (Timeline: 4-6 weeks)


## Content Analysis (Qualitative)

- **Key Strengths for Protocol Research (from KB)**: Useful for analyzing protocol documentation, communication logs, or stakeholder feedback
- **Limitations/Considerations (from KB)**: Interpretation can be subjective if not rigorously applied; Limited to available textual data


## Ethnography
- **Classification**: Cultural Immersion Methodology
- **Paradigm**: Interpretivist/Constructivist
- **Purpose**: Studying people in their own environment to understand their culture, behaviors, and social structures.
- **Mentions in Current Literature**: 4 (in 1 papers)

- **Key Strengths for Protocol Research (from KB)**: Rich contextual understanding of protocol use in situ; Can uncover tacit knowledge and informal practices
- **Limitations/Considerations (from KB)**: Typically long-term and immersive, challenging for short thesis; Observer bias potential


## Grounded Theory Methodology
- **Classification**: Theory-Building Qualitative Methodology
- **Paradigm**: Interpretivist with systematic analytical procedures
- **Purpose**: Generate theory grounded in systematically collected and analyzed data
- **Mentions in Current Literature**: 3 (in 2 papers)
  - *Example Context (from literature):* INFLUENCE_FACTORS_OF_THE_TACIT_KNOWLEDGE_ELICITATION_PROCESS_SYSTEMATIC_LITERATURE_REVIEW.md: ...map an aggregate cognitive map  abdul-rahman, wang and siong,  2011  repertory grid and cluster analysis  selwyn and classen, 2012  storytelling and **grounded theory**  naweed, 2014  cognitive work analysis (cwa), critical decision  method (cdm) and ground theory  rosário et. al, 2015  unstructured interview,  card...
- **Key Strengths for Protocol Research (from KB)**: Generates novel theoretical insights about protocol adaptation
- **Limitations/Considerations (from KB)**: Extremely time-intensive; May not align well with technical protocol research objectives
