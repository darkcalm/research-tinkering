# Apply PICO/PEO Framework (Task 3.4.3)

This document details the application of the PEO (Population, Exposure, Outcome) framework to the primary research question (Task 3.4.1), based on the defined problem (Task 3.2.1), scope (Task 3.2.3), and selected research direction (Task 3.1.2). The PEO framework is used here as it is more suitable than PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) for this research, which focuses on an exposure (to specific protocols) rather than a comparison between interventions.

## PEO Framework Application

Applying the PEO framework to the primary research question:

**Primary Research Question:** How can Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) and Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A) be applied and adapted to enable secure, scalable, and interoperable communication for decentralized predictive maintenance coordination among diverse, multi-owner Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), and what quantitative framework can be developed to evaluate their performance in this context?

*   **P - Population/Problem:** Diverse, multi-owner Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and the various entities (owners, operators, maintenance providers) involved in their decentralized predictive maintenance coordination.
    *   *Grounding:* This aligns with the specific research problem (`docs/3.2.1-specific-problem.md`) and the defined scope (`docs/3.2.3-define-scope.md`) which emphasizes diverse and multi-owner DERs in a decentralized context.

*   **E - Exposure/Intervention:** The application and adaptation of Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) and Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A) for enabling the necessary communication flows (e.g., health data exchange, maintenance task initiation) for predictive maintenance coordination.
    *   *Grounding:* This is the central focus of the selected research direction (`docs/3.1.2-research-direction-selection.md`) and is explicitly mentioned in the primary research question.

*   **O - Outcome:** Enabling secure, scalable, and interoperable communication to facilitate effective decentralized predictive maintenance coordination among the DERs and relevant entities, and developing a quantitative framework for evaluating protocol performance in this context.
    *   *Grounding:* This reflects the desired outcome of addressing the research problem, ensuring the communication supports the goals of predictive maintenance (reliable operation, efficiency) and meets key technical requirements (security, scalability, interoperability) as highlighted in the problem articulation and justification of significance (`docs/3.2.1-specific-problem.md`, `docs/3.2.2-justify-significance.md`).

## Why PEO instead of PICO?

The PEO framework is chosen over PICO because the research design does not primarily involve comparing the effectiveness of a specific intervention (like a new protocol implementation) against an alternative (like a traditional communication method) in a controlled manner to measure an outcome. Instead, the research focuses on exploring the *application and adaptation* of specific protocols (ACP and A2A - the Exposure) within a particular population/problem context (decentralized, multi-owner DERs - the Population) to achieve a desired state or capability (secure, scalable, interoperable communication for predictive maintenance and a quantitative evaluation framework - the Outcome). The PEO framework is better suited for studies exploring factors or exposures and their outcomes within a defined population, which aligns more closely with the conceptual design and analysis nature of this thesis proposal.

Applying this framework helps to clarify the key elements of the primary research question and ensures it is well-defined and focused.
