# Research Boundaries (Task 3.5.1)

This document defines the explicit boundaries and limitations of the research, building upon the scope defined in `docs/3.2.3-define-scope.md`.

## Boundaries

Based on the defined scope and the constraints of a Master's thesis, the research will adhere to the following boundaries:

*   **Protocol Focus:** The analysis and conceptual design will be strictly limited to the application and adaptation of the **Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)** and **Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A)**. Other agent protocols or general communication standards will not be explored in detail.
*   **Use Case Specificity:** The research is focused *solely* on the **predictive maintenance coordination** use case for DERs. Applications of ACP/A2A in other DER functions (e.g., energy trading, grid stability services) are outside the boundaries.
*   **Quantitative Framework:** The research will develop a structured framework for measuring and comparing protocol performance through:
    - Literature review to identify relevant performance metrics and evaluation methodologies
    - Development of benchmark scenarios based on documented specifications
    - Establishment of evaluation criteria through analysis of protocol features
    - Design of comparison methodology for systematic assessment
    - Limited validation through:
        * Implementation of a simplified test case using basic protocol features
        * Testing with a small set of representative scenarios
        * Validation of key metrics against theoretical predictions
        * Documentation of validation results and limitations
    The validation will be limited in scope and complexity to ensure feasibility within the thesis timeframe.
*   **Analysis Basis:** The evaluation of protocol suitability and feasibility will be based on:
    - Literature review and protocol specifications
    - Theoretical performance analysis using documented metrics
    - Scalability assessment based on protocol architecture
    - Security and reliability evaluation using published data
    - Results from limited framework validation
    While comprehensive empirical evaluation is not within the boundaries, limited validation of the quantitative framework is included to ensure its practical applicability.
*   **DER Generalization:** While considering the characteristics of DERs relevant to communication, the research will not provide in-depth technical analysis for every specific DER type (e.g., solar, wind, battery storage). The focus is on common communication requirements and performance metrics.
*   **Supporting Aspects:** While acknowledged and discussed in relation to the core problem, detailed analysis or design of supporting aspects like specific predictive maintenance algorithms, advanced security mechanisms beyond conceptual consideration, policy implications, business models, or human-agent interfaces are outside the defined boundaries.
*   **Timeframe:** The research is bounded by the typical timeframe of a 20-week Master's thesis, which necessitates a focused scope and reliance on existing knowledge, theoretical analysis, and conceptual work rather than extensive empirical studies. The limited validation of the quantitative framework is designed to be achievable within this timeframe.

These boundaries ensure the research remains focused, manageable, and achievable within the given constraints while still addressing a relevant and significant problem within the energy domain through both conceptual design and quantitative analysis, including limited practical validation.
