# Quality and Review Process for Course Thesis Proposal

## Quality Metrics

These metrics are designed to ensure the proposal meets the academic standards and effectively demonstrates the Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs) for the Master's thesis.

### Document Quality Metrics

#### Content Quality
1. **Word Count Compliance**
   - **Target:** Approximately 2000 words (~4 pages of text)
   - **Acceptable Range:** 2000-3000 words (~4-6 pages of text)
   - **Maximum Limit:** Not to exceed 3000 words to maintain clarity
   - **Rationale:** Clarity over comprehensiveness - avoid becoming too wide and vague toward the "real problem" at hand
   - **Note:** References and figures are not included in page/word count
   - **Measurement:** LaTeX word count tool, focus on text content excluding bibliography

2. **Clarity and Focus**
   - **Primary Goal:** Clear articulation of the specific problem and approach

   - **Ensure:** Relevant facts and examples that directly support the chosen topic
   - **Balance:** Rich referenced background without becoming vague about the real problem
   - **Measurement:** Clarity assessment checklist, focus validation review

3. **Structure Completeness**
