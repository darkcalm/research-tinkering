## Recommended Compression Strategies

1. **Synthesize Rather Than Describe:** Transform detailed analyses into key insights
2. **Focus on Relevance:** Include only content directly supporting the research objectives
3. **Use Summary Tables:** Replace lengthy descriptions with structured tables
4. **Prioritize High-Impact Content:** Include findings that directly inform the research design
5. **Reference Detailed Work:** Acknowledge comprehensive analyses while presenting distilled insights

## Quality Assurance Guidelines

- Maintain academic rigor while achieving word targets
- Ensure all ILOs are adequately addressed within word limits
