# 8.1.6 Simplified Visual Planning Integration Guide (Focused Approach)

*Generated: 2025-06-04T21:29:58.454562*
*Task: 8.1.6 - Simplified Visual Planning*

**Important Note:** Due to technical difficulties encountered with generating complex LaTeX figures reliably through scripting (e.g., intricate TikZ positioning, potential package conflicts), the decision has been made to focus on integrating only the two most critical and robustly generatable diagrams:

1.  **Conceptual Model Diagram**
2.  **Timeline Gantt Chart**

Other previously considered visual aids (methodology comparison tables, detailed risk matrices as complex TikZ, etc.) will be represented textually or with simple tables directly within the main document to ensure stability and avoid compilation issues.

## Generated LaTeX Figures

### 1. Conceptual Model Diagram
- **File**: `deliverable/images/conceptual-model-diagram.tex`
- **Purpose**: Visual representation of the theoretical framework and core concepts.
- **Integration**: Recommended for inclusion in Section 4 (Theoretical Framework).
- **Compilation**: Uses TikZ. Ensure necessary libraries are in `main.tex` preamble.

### 2. Timeline Gantt Chart
- **File**: `deliverable/images/timeline-gantt-simple.tex`
- **Purpose**: Visual timeline for the research project.
- **Integration**: Recommended for inclusion in Section 7.2 (Implementation Timeline).
- **Compilation**: Uses `pgfgantt`. Ensure this package is in `main.tex` preamble.

## Integration Instructions for `main.tex`

### 1. Add to Preamble (if not already present):
```latex
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes,arrows,positioning,fit,backgrounds,calc,decorations.pathreplacing} % For Conceptual Model
\usepackage{pgfgantt} % For Timeline
\usepackage{float} % For [H] figure placement, helps keep figures where intended
\usepackage{xcolor} % Usually included by tikz or pgfgantt, but good to ensure
```

### 2. Include Figures in Their Respective Sections:

**For Conceptual Model (e.g., in Section 4, after describing the model):**
```latex
% ... text describing the theoretical framework ...

\input{images/conceptual-model-diagram.tex}

% ... further text ...
```
*Consider placing it after the `\subsection{Core Conceptual Model}` or `\subsection{Framework Integration and Theoretical Contributions}`.*

**For Timeline Gantt Chart (e.g., in Section 7.2, replacing or complementing the text list):**
```latex
\subsection{Implementation Timeline}

\input{images/timeline-gantt-simple.tex}

% Optionally, remove or condense the textual list of weeks/milestones if the Gantt chart is sufficient.
% \textbf{Weeks 1-8:} Systematic literature review and gap analysis completion
% \textbf{Weeks 9-16:} Compositional framework development and protocol analysis
% \textbf{Weeks 17-20:} Proof of concept development and validation
% ...
```

## Compilation Notes

1.  **Simple Design**: The generated `.tex` files are self-contained documents for easier testing but are meant to be `\input` into `main.tex`.
2.  **Dependencies**: `main.tex` must load the required packages (`tikz`, `pgfgantt`, `float`, `xcolor` and TikZ libraries).
3.  **Figure Placement**: The `[H]` option (from the `float` package) is used in the generated files to suggest placing the figure "here". This generally works well when `\input`.
4.  **Captions & Labels**: Basic captions and labels are included in the generated files. You can adjust them as needed directly or by modifying this script.

## Quality Assurance

-   The `conceptual-model-diagram.tex` is a direct copy of a previously validated TikZ diagram.
-   The `timeline-gantt-simple.tex` uses basic `pgfgantt` features, similar to the `gantt-chart.tex` example.
-   Focus is on robust, error-free compilation.

## Next Steps

1.  Ensure the specified LaTeX packages are in the preamble of `deliverable/main.tex`.
2.  Add the `\input` commands to the relevant sections of `deliverable/main.tex`.
3.  Compile `deliverable/main.tex` to verify integration and appearance.
4.  Adjust placement, surrounding text, and captions in `main.tex` as needed.
5.  Update task status.
