*Based on methodologies identified in: `5.1.1-relevant-methodologies.json`*

This document provides detailed descriptions for the **1** mixed research methodologies identified as relevant from the current literature review.


## Mixed Methods Research (General)
- **Classification**: General Mixed Methodology Approach
- **Paradigm**: Pragmatic
- **Purpose**: Integrating quantitative and qualitative data to provide a more complete understanding of a research problem.
- **Mentions in Current Literature**: 1 (in 1 papers)
  - *Example Context (from literature):* Tacit_knowledge_elicitation_process_for_industry_40.md: ...cs/​wef_​48540_​wp_​end_​ of_​innov​ation_​prote​cting_​patent_​law.​pdf. 	85.	 magnusson ms. t-pattern detection and analysis (tpa) with themetm : a **mixed methods** approach. front psychol. 2020;10:2663. https://​ doi.​org/​10.​3389/​fpsyg.​2019.​02663. publisher’s note  springer nature remains neutral with regar...
- **Key Strengths for Protocol Research (from KB)**: Can offer triangulation of findings; May provide richer insights than a single method alone
- **Limitations/Considerations (from KB)**: Requires expertise in both quantitative and qualitative methods; Can be time-consuming and complex to integrate findings meaningfully
- **Typical Duration (from KB)**: Varies greatly depending on specific design


## Next Steps

- Research emerging methodologies (Task 5.1.5)
- Create comprehensive methodology comparison matrix (Task 5.2.1)
