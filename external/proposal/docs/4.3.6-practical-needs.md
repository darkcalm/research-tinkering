ough VR can be cost-effective and faster. Furthermore, XR devices have the potential to enhance semi-autonomous control and operations in the nuclear asset management of DTs. They can offer operators an immersive interface, projecting 3D representations and real-time data overlays directly onto physical components. When integrated with IoT sensors, XR can facilitate emergency responses and foster **collaborative decision**-making, potentially improving overall plant efficiency and ensuring a safer and more responsive nuclear power plant operation. Kuts et al. (2019) described the synchronized control of industrial robotic cell through a combination of its digital twin and VR. This is of relevance to the nuclear industry as with better VR controls, it will be feasible to manage nuclear assets in 3- D in real-time us

l aspect of this approach is related to workers’ communication skills. SMEs who have previous experience expressing their expertise are far more able to share their knowledge than others. On the contrary, workers who lack minimal communication skills with similar domain expertise cannot externalize their knowledge correctly to others. A better approach is described in [14] without considering **tacit knowledge**. 2. One-on-one mentoring: Most companies prefer to organize a worker development program in the form of one- on-one mentoring [15], where a new apprentice shadows some veteran engineer, technician, or senior worker in the first 6 or 12 months on the job. The **tacit knowledge** is usually passed on during on-site training. However, due to the urgency of the assigned tasks, senior engineers typical

Many companies do not have any systematic approach to collect and incorporate the field experience of experienced workers and assess the role of tacit **knowledge management** on the success of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems implementation [13]. At best, the loss of tacit knowledge is mitigated by informal procedures [6]. The main approaches proposed are the following: 1.

In particular, usual approaches from operational research [28,29] don’t leverage very well available historical data, whereas current data-driven approaches could provide a welcome speed-up. They don’t integrate **operator experience** and preferred thought pro- cess, hence limiting their acceptability. New research is emerging to better integrate hu- man decision-making [30]. Finally, the current workﬂow only considers snapshot-based solutions, not sequential decisions over a time horizon, thus putting the burden of the anticipation and evaluation of action long-term consequences on the operator alone.

In the TSO-DSO hybrid-managed model, the DER services bids validation is under the DSO responsibility, while the DER dispatch remains responsibility of the TSO. In the DSO-managed model, both the responsibility of DER services bids validation and DER dispatch falls on the DSO. These two models, however, increase the **coordination complexity** be- tween the TSO and DSOs. They can also be affected by poten- tial conflicts of interest from the DSO in regard to facilitating more DER services vs. the added cost that this will incur as their assets will be pushed to the limits.

It is contradictory for one to try to investigate the concept of knowledge which is known to be hard to articulate in the ﬁrst place. In order for one’s personal tacit dimension of a knowledge to be made transferable to others, the individual must ﬁrst acknowledge it, or at least be able to exercise an action that can validate to others one’s possession of that k

Another challenge is that the nature of the work that analysts conduct tends to be more sensitive against the public eye. Some may not even support the con- cept of documenting **tacit knowledge** due to the potential risk of leaking conﬁdential information about the business operation to its competitors.

However, these known problem areas did not appear to be recorded or formally presented to inspectors in the organisation’s work standards which means this information would have to be stored in inspectors’ memories and **tacit knowledge**. As mentioned in the literature, retaining this knowledge and applying it to the visual inspection process is likely to lead to increased task complexity for operators particularly when this process is still being applied as knowledge or rule based performances (Gramopadhye, et al., 1997).

This example shows that if this sort of information can be captured and provided in formal training it may reduce operators’ cognitive load for this part of the inspection process. In Area A the study showed that operators apply **tacit knowledge** and skills to adapt methods to combat task complexity caused by surface texture, as exposed by Drury and Clement’s (1978) research, by adjusting components and moving them under light sources to increase visibility of defects. Task complexity is also likely to be heightened in Area A due to an extensive defect list which would be expected to contribute to increased cognitive demand (Wickens

To mitigate this possibility, we introduce the role of the game master played by the KE, who facilitates the com- munication exchange with SMEs. The KE should be technically knowledgeable and possess a positive command attitude and directional authority to create a friendly environment and make **knowledge transfer** possible. The natural choice is to select the knowledge engineer from the pool of the best-performing SMEs, but other options that strongly depend on the corporate culture and personnel availability are possible. The HE and the KE will also create gold standards for quality assessment made of CMs extracted by human annotators from a set of tests [53]. • Phase III—Learning: In the learning pha

For the objectives of this paper, the SECI spiral model of knowledge creation perfectly justifies the role game we propose to convert **tacit knowledge** into explicit knowledge with human and virtual agents interacting in the process of knowledge transformation. It is worthwhile noting how the inability to formalize directly **tacit knowledge** does not exclude the possibility that a virtual agent (a computer system) might perform the same tasks using alternative repre- sentations or that **tacit knowledge** cannot be transferred to a machine [29, 30]. Nevertheless, no automatic cognitive system can capture the **tacit knowledge** or any other genuine human activity with a purely algorithmic approach—from workers’ heads to corporate database

Modern production processes require integration between factory floor automation and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, with the Manufacturing Execution System (MES) serving as the intermediary to manage production lines aligned with business strategies. The MES enhances **situational awareness** of the production process, and a CPPS plays a critical role in real-time DM support and predictive planning, thereby reducing unnecessary operational costs [13,14]. A fundamental element of CPS is Machine to Machine (M2M) communication, which encompasses any interaction between machines, controllers, and actuators across wired and wireless networks.

The emerging HDT concept offers new possibilities by inte- grating multi-source data and artificial intelligence for continuous monitoring and assessment. Hence, this paper reviews the evolution from DHM to HDT and proposes a unified HDT framework from a **human factors** perspective. The framework comprises the physical twin, the virtual twin, and the linkage between these two. The virtual twin integrates human modeling and AI engines to enable model-data-hybrid-enabled simulation. HDT can potentially upgrade traditional ergonomic methods to intelligent services through real-time analysis, timely feedback, and bidi- rectional interactions. Finally, the future

In general, a modularized user interface (UI) in HDT that is flexible and replace- able for the new is essential to ensure timeliness as new modes of interaction (e.g., gestures and voice) emerge. 4 Framework of HDT in **human factors** Based on the above analysis, a unified HDT framework is being proposed to integrate **human factors** and digi- tal techniques to deal with complex and dynamic situ- ations in reality. As shown in Figure 4, the proposed HDT framework is composed of the Physical Twin (PT), the Virtual Twin (VT), and the linkage between the PT and VT. It is designed based on a common connotation of digital twin (DT) according to [76, 77] and follows a widely consensual HDT framework for health and well- being

In addition, a digital representation of the physical human is also made available to create an end- to-end immersive twin that can be displayed livelier on terminal devices. To this end, this HDT framework concentrates more on accurate virtual-real mapping of essential **human factors**, such as body movements, work- ing postures, and physical and cognitive status, rather than a high-fidelity representation of human anatomy. Finally, the digital avatar must interact with both physical humans and other VTs through multi-modal interaction. Advanced technologies like AR/VR, wearables, and high- performance computing help to create an all-around and immersive interactive experi

tion of DT technology across all areas of our lives and work has promoted the develop- ment of HDT in the medical and sports fields. However, HDT is still in its infancy in the industrial field because human needs are not prioritized in the technological- centered period; instead, there is an ongoing pursuit of the quality and efficiency of production. In light of the growing emphasis on the **human factors** in Industry 5.0 and the HCPS paradigm, our research has found that HDT has the potential to provide intelligent services including data visualization, monitoring, prediction, and immersive interaction, by considering the human fac- tors throughout the product lifecycle. Furthermore, a few leading companies have shown interests and a trend of application towards HDT in the industrial field,

as knowledge or rule based performances (Gramopadhye, et al., 1997). Indeed, it was observed that after known areas had been inspected both Area A and B inspectors followed a systematic inspection process which would reduce workload and ensure all steps are completed. This example shows that if this sort of information can be captured and provided in formal training it may reduce operators’ **cognitive load** for this part of the inspection process. In Area A the study showed that operators apply tacit knowledge and skills to adapt methods to combat task complexity caused by surface texture, as exposed by Drury and Clement’s (1978) research, by adjusting components and moving them under light sources to increase visibility of defects. Task complexity is also likely to be heightened in Area A due

e in-service components they arrive dirty and, therefore, defects may be masked. However, here tacit knowledge was also found being applied to combat task complexity as the hand cleaning task prior to full inspection is used to complete a preliminary top-level inspection which pairs tactile and visual feedback to identify potential problem areas. This is highly likely to reduce the additional **cognitive load** caused by visual impairment from the dirt on the components’ surface. These results show that, over time, personnel observed in both case studies have developed solutions to limitations and challenges in their VI tasks which have developed into a range of tacit knowledge and skills. The elicitation and identification of tacit knowledge in these case studies verifies the findings from Phipps,

Touchscreens, augmented reality, or other virtual controls allow for intuitive inter- action with quick adaptability to a changing environment (Stadtmann et al. 2023; Lalik and Watorek 2021; Kilimann et al. 2019). The human–machine interface, combined with **decision support** systems based on predictive insights, provides operators with contextual information and recommenda- tions for decision-making. Another important role of the human–machine interface is to enable operational training as a support tool for new operators.

According to Kaber, Perry, Segall, McClernon and Prinzel (2006), the objective of dynamic function allocation is to moderate the mental workload of the operator, and to support **situational awareness**, by facilitating the management of the cognitive tradeoff between task demand and cognitive resources. Indeed, according to Parasuraman et al. (1992), dynamic function allocation allows a better combination between the capabilities of the operator and those of the machine. Kaber and Endsley (2004) especially identified three criteria to drive function allocation: - Critical events: the allo

These 4 different criteria can be measured in different ways. Trust. To measure trust in autonomy, authors used “direct” and subjective questionnaires or scales (like HRI trust scale or **Trust in automation** scale, see Lewis et al. (2018) for survey paper), or “indirect” and objective measures. Trust is mainly observed along two main dimensions, based on performance, or social relation, studied independently or together (see Law and Scheutz (2021) for a recent literature review). Performance-based trust is based on the perceived reliability or explainability of the autonomous agent, and can be

Radiation-related **situational awareness** can be communicated in this physical twin by marking high and low radiation areas. This is however an expensive preposition.
