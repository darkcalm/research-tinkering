# Develop Sub-Questions (Task 3.4.2)

This document outlines the development of specific sub-questions that support and break down the primary research question (Task 3.4.1), based on the specific objectives (Task 3.3.2) and defined scope (Task 3.2.3). The sub-questions are designed to be addressed within the scope of the thesis proposal and contribute to answering the primary research question.

## Sub-Questions

Based on the primary research question and specific objectives, the following sub-questions will guide the research:

1.  **Sub-Question 1: What are the key communication requirements for enabling decentralized predictive maintenance coordination among diverse Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) owned and operated by different entities?**
    *   This sub-question directly supports Objective 1 (To analyze the communication requirements) and is essential for understanding the technical and organizational needs that agent protocols must address for this use case.

2.  **Sub-Question 2: How can the features and messaging patterns of Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) and Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A) be applied and potentially adapted to address these requirements, ensuring secure, scalable, and interoperable communication for DER predictive maintenance coordination?**
    *   This sub-question links directly to Objectives 2, 3, and 4 (To investigate protocol features, design a conceptual framework, and specify messaging patterns). It focuses on the core application and adaptation of the specific agent protocols (ACP and A2A) to meet the identified communication requirements, which is the central theme of the research.

3.  **Sub-Question 3: What metrics and evaluation criteria should be used to assess the performance of ACP and A2A in the context of DER predictive maintenance coordination, and how can these be identified through literature review?**
    *   This sub-question supports Objective 5 (To develop a quantitative evaluation framework) and focuses on the systematic identification of relevant performance metrics and evaluation criteria through literature review, ensuring a rigorous and well-grounded approach to protocol assessment.

These three sub-questions break down the primary research question into more focused and answerable inquiries that will be addressed through the research activities outlined by the specific objectives.
