Per the instruction, I have mentioned that the proposal can hold approximately 2000 words. "Approximately" meaning that it is not superstrict. 2000 words is about 4 pages of text. Here, you don't have to include references or figures in those pages. If you spill over to 6 pages (3000 words) this is also OK.

However, I don't want a 15 pager ... Why? Because it will negatively affect clarity. I want the background to be rich in referenced facts and examples, but they need to be RELEVANT for your chosen topic. If you make it too wide, you often become vague towards the "real problem" at hand, and therefore it becomes hard to motivate the objective and so on.  I like to think of it as "you can't see the forest for all the trees ..." -- a saying used sometimes.

Also, in a "real" proposal situation you are not making the full literature review for your thesis -- that comes later as part of your overall methodology and time plan. And while you should describe alternative methods for the purpose of your objective, discuss them, and then motivate and further detail your choice -- it shall NOT be at the level of detail that you will later describe in your Master thesis report.

Think of the purpose of the proposal -- it is so that you have a good understanding of what you are going to do for your thesis, and for your company and supervisors who are involved to be well-informed. Often, you would probably like to iterate the proposal with such participants before you get going on the proposal. Then, it shouldn't be too long.
