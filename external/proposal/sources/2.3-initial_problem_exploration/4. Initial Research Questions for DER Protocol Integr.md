# Initial Research Questions for DER Protocol Integration

## Core Research Question

**How can emerging agent communication protocols (MCP/ACP/A2A) be adapted to bridge the gap between system-level distributed energy resource (DER) management requirements and individual device capabilities?**

## Technical Implementation Questions

1. **Protocol Adaptation**
    - What modifications are required to align MCP/ACP/A2A with IEEE 1547-2018 and UL 1741 SA standards?
    - How can protocol buffers be designed to enable automatic CIM/61850 schema translation?
    - What quantum-resistant encryption methods maintain sub-150ms latency for DER control messages?
2. **Interoperability Frameworks**
    - How should automated protocol negotiation mechanisms handle multi-vendor DER environments?
    - What QoS extensions enable priority handling of critical infrastructure messages per IEEE 2030.5?
    - Can Linux MCP-DBus bridging techniques achieve >90% automated schema mapping for DER components?
3. **Scalability Challenges**
    - What hybrid architectures combine MCP resource registration with A2A dynamic task management for 10,000+ node networks?
    - How do federated learning models impact optimization solve times in decentralized DER coordination?
    - What edge computing configurations reduce cloud dependency while maintaining 99.7% consensus accuracy?

## Operational Performance Questions

4. **Coordination Effectiveness**
    - Does A2A's task lifecycle model improve frequency stabilization response times below 150ms during dip events?
    - How does MCP's tripartite architecture impact voltage regulation accuracy in high-penetration DER scenarios?
    - What performance tradeoffs emerge when implementing HIPAA-style encryption in DER telemetry streams?
5. **Cross-Domain Transfers**
    - Can manufacturing OPC UA models achieve >80% compatibility with DER capability registries?
    - How do healthcare-derived JWT token implementations affect DER onboarding workflows?
    - What IoT-inspired MACsec configurations enable sub-1ms latency for protection relay communications?

## Policy and Sustainability Questions

6. **Regulatory Alignment**
    - What certification processes ensure protocol implementations meet evolving FERC Order 2222 requirements?
    - How should dynamic tariff structures incentivize protocol-enabled DER services across state jurisdictions?
    - What interoperability testing frameworks validate compliance with NERC CIP-002-5.1a security standards?
7. **Sustainability Impact**
    - Do protocol-driven DER coordination models increase renewable hosting capacity beyond 65% penetration levels?
    - How does edge-based processing reduce carbon emissions compared to centralized cloud architectures?
    - What equity considerations arise from protocol-dependent DER participation requirements?

## Validation and Methodology Questions

8. **Testing Approaches**
    - What metrics quantify semantic interoperability improvements in CIM/61850 schema mappings?
    - How should the NREL ARIES platform be configured to stress-test protocol extensions at grid scale?
    - What constitutes a representative DER mix for protocol performance benchmarking?
9. **Implementation Pathways**
    - What phased rollout strategy minimizes disruption to existing utility communication infrastructures?
    - How can protocol adaptation costs be justified against \$214M/5yr equipment underperformance losses?
    - What training programs enable smooth transition from legacy SCADA systems to agent-based architectures?

These questions directly address the identified research gaps while maintaining alignment with SDG 7 (Affordable Clean Energy) and SDG 9 (Industry Innovation). The PICO framework ensures answerability through measurable outcomes:

**P** - DER systems with protocol integration challenges
**I** - Adapted MCP/ACP/A2A implementations
**C** - Traditional DERMS architectures
**O** - Improved interoperability, scalability, and security metrics

**Next Step:** Task 2.3.5 - Prepare for problem formulation phase.
