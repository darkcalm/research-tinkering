Digital twins (DTs) have emerged as a promising technology for enhancing predictive maintenance (PMx) and operational support in distributed energy resources (DERs). While DTs offer significant potential for improving efficiency, automation, and cost-effectiveness in industrial operations (Melesse et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2024), several limitations hinder their widespread adoption. These include poor explainability, sample inefficiency in data-driven methods, and high complexity in physics-based models (Ma et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2023). Current DT implementations also face challenges in standardization, real-time capabilities, and integration with other technologies (Idrisov et al., 2023; D'Amico et al., 2022). To address these limitations, researchers propose developing hybrid modeling strategies, improving data fusion algorithms, and creating standardized frameworks for DT implementation in PMx (Kandemir et al., 2024; Abdullahi et al., 2024). Future research should focus on enhancing DT maturity, addressing gaps in current implementations, and developing requirement-based roadmaps for standardized PMx automation using DT technologies (Ma et al., 2023).
