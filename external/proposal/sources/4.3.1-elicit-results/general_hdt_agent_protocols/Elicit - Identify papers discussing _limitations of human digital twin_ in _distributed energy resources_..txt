Digital twins (DTs) offer promising applications in distributed energy resources and smart grids, but face several limitations. Key challenges include big data management, real-time measurements, continuous communication, and investment in measuring systems (Lamagna et al., 2021). Security concerns are often overlooked, with DTs presented as an additional layer of protection rather than a potential vulnerability (Heluany & Gkioulos, 2023). Measurement and network uncertainties significantly impact DT output quality (Deakin et al., 2023). Human-focused DTs for occupational safety require complex integration of hardware and software components (Park et al., 2023). In power systems, DTs can address limitations of conventional virtual power plants, such as lack of real-time simulation and predictive maintenance (Idrisov et al., 2023). However, implementing DTs in buildings faces technical shortcomings in current Internet of Things systems (Khajavi et al., 2019). Despite these challenges, DTs show potential for improving design, operation, and maintenance across various domains (Botín-Sanabria et al., 2008; Patel et al., 2023).
