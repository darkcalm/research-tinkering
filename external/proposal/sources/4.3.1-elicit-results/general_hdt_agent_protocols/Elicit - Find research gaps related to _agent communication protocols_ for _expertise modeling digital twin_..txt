Recent research on digital twins and agent communication protocols highlights several key areas. Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical assets that enable real-time monitoring and decision-making (Barnard & Stolze, 2023; Luan et al., 2021). Multi-agent systems play a crucial role in implementing digital twins, particularly in healthcare and smart agriculture (Kalyani & Collier, 2024; Croatti et al., 2020). Communication protocols like MQTT and OPC UA are essential for data transmission in digital twin systems (Barnard & Stolze, 2023). Integrating expert knowledge with data-driven approaches remains a challenge in developing accurate digital twin models (Jungmann & Lazarova-Molnar, 2024). Research gaps include the need for standardized definitions, exploration of use cases across product lifecycles, and addressing data ownership issues (Jones et al., 2020). Novel frameworks like the "Expert Twin" combine traditional simulations with real-time communication and fuzzy logic to enhance decision-making in manufacturing (Monek & Fischer, 2024). Agent-directed digital twins show promise in simulation-based training for organizational processes (Lektauers et al., 2022).
