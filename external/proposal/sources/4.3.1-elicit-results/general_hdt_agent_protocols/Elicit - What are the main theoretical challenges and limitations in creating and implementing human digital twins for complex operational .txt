Creating and implementing human digital twins (HDTs) for complex operational roles like DER workers faces several theoretical challenges and limitations. Data integration and real-time information extraction are significant hurdles (Möhring et al., 2022; Ghanbarifard et al., 2023). The high degree of individuality among humans necessitates AI-based learning to accurately represent each person (Vildjiounaite et al., 2023). Developing HDTs for labor-intensive systems adds uncertainty and requires consideration of worker well-being (Götz & Lazarova-Molnar, 2024; Berti et al., 2023). Integrating various hardware and software components for human data acquisition and representation is challenging (Park et al., 2023). HDTs must address human activities, knowledge-based behavior, and professional characteristics while ensuring interoperability with machine digital twins (Bomström et al., 2022). Ethical implications, including potential misuse of HDTs, must also be carefully considered (Cardin & Trentesaux, 2022). Despite these challenges, HDTs offer potential benefits in improving efficiency, safety, and decision-making in complex operational environments.
