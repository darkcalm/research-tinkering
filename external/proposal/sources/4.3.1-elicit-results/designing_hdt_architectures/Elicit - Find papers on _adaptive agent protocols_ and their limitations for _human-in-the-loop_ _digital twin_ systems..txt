Recent research explores adaptive agent protocols and digital twins for human-in-the-loop systems, addressing challenges of transparency and controllability. Digital twins combined with VR interfaces enhance human involvement in self-adaptation processes (Enes Yigitbas et al., 2021). Human Digital Twins (HDTs) are proposed to manage human-agent interactions, ensuring consistency and alignment with human objectives (Hafez, 2021; Hafez, 2019). Multi-agent systems play a crucial role in implementing digital twins, facilitating adaptability and real-time data management (Kalyani & Collier, 2024). The ANSR-DT framework combines neuro-symbolic learning for improved decision-making in human-machine collaboration (Bin Hakim et al., 2025). However, limitations exist in extracting symbolic rules in complex environments. Applications in healthcare systems show potential for workload management and burnout prevention (Xames & Topcu, 2023). Two-layer machine learning architectures for HDTs enable intelligent human-machine collaboration by learning communication patterns without relying on content (Hafez, 2020).
