Recent research highlights the potential of digital twins (DTs) for enhancing distributed energy resource (DER) management and human-agent interaction in smart environments. DTs can improve visibility and control of DERs, addressing challenges in power system security and renewable integration (Han et al., 2022; Ilić et al., 2020). Human Digital Twins are proposed to manage human-agent interactions consistently (Hafez, 2021). Multi-agent systems play a crucial role in DT implementations for various applications, including smart agriculture (Kalyani & Collier, 2024). However, several challenges remain, such as protocol-level security vulnerabilities in DER communications (Sundararajan et al., 2018), interoperability issues in developing a European electricity grid DT (Diakakis et al., 2024), and the need for suitable modeling and simulation approaches for local energy communities (Nguyen-Huu et al., 2022). The field still lacks a universal DT reference framework, standardization, and widely accepted performance metrics (Sharma et al., 2020), highlighting areas for future research and development.
