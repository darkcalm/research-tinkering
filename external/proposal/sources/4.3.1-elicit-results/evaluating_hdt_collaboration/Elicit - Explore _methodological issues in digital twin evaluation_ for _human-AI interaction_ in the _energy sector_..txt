Digital twins (DTs) are gaining prominence in the energy sector, offering benefits such as improved asset performance, efficiency, and environmental impact reduction (Ghenai et al., 2022). They are being applied across various energy domains, including generation, transmission, and distribution (Ismail et al., 2024). DTs enable predictive maintenance, grid optimization, and integration of renewable energy sources (Ismail et al., 2024). Methodological approaches like MEREC and MAIRCA are being used to evaluate DT solutions for smart city energy systems (Elsayed et al., 2024). However, human-DT interaction remains understudied in HCI literature (Barricelli & Fogli, 2022). DTs are also being employed for household energy management and smart appliance research (Koropiecki & Piotrowski, 2023). Researchers are developing open architecture frameworks and technology stacks to facilitate DT implementation in the energy sector (Gourisetti et al., 2023). DTs show potential for improving energy consumption management in production environments (Perossa et al., 2022) and are expected to play a significant role in future energy applications (Wang et al., 2022).
