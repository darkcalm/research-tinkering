1 Introduction 
 
Tacit knowledge can be understood as the practical way to know how to perform 
some activity. The term is not limited only to a category of knowledge, but to a process 
of building skills, competencies and rationalities Oguz and Elif (2011).  Studies on tacit 
knowledge began in Polanyi (1966), especially regarding the dimension of this kind of 
knowledge. Subsequently, Nonaka (1991) and Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995), 
disseminated the concepts of tacit knowledge, relating it to the process of conversion to 
explicit knowledge for the purpose of promoting organizational learning, the process of 
conversion, according to Zhou (2004) and Flanagan and Clarkson (2007), beginning with 
the understanding of the cognitive process of knowledge holders. 
Nonaka (1994), Nonaka, Byosiere and Borucki (1994), Nonaka, Umemoto and 
Senoo (1996) and Nonaka and Von Krogh (2009) contributed to Polanyi's thesis by 
focusing on the theory of knowledge creation, instituting the four stages of conversion of 
tacit knowledge to explicit, i) Socialization, ii) Externalization, iii) Combination and iv) 
Internalization, represented by the SECI model. Through the four phases, knowledge is 
transformed from individual epistemological tacit to explicit organizational ontological. 
However, Gavrilova and Andreeva (2012) point to limitations in the Externalization 
phase, indicating research opportunities to explore this phase of knowledge conversion. 
In this sense, the authors stimulate the scientific community when they pose the following 
question, “Externalization, how to achieve it?”. One of the mechanisms adopted by the 
scientific community to promote the conversion of tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge 
are the tactics of eliciting tacit knowledge Rosário et al. (2015); Hao et al. (2017). 
Gàbor and Barna (1988) and Wagne, Otto and Chung (2002) indicate that 
knowledge elicitation is the main activity in the management of Knowledge Based 
Systems (KBS). In this context, Ulrich (2004), Li Dacheng and Jinji Gao (2010), Garg, 
Monica, Sharma and Yashi (2014), Liu, Jian-Xin, Xiao-Jun and Ging-lian (2014), Oliva, 
Medina, Weber and Jung (2015) recognize the importance of human knowledge as part 
of the systems modeling process developed to promote greater process reliability. 
Knowledge mapping, as exemplified in Margaryan, Littlejohn and Stanton (2016), 
consists of the development of mechanisms that comprise tacit practices. In a macro 
context, they have a multidisciplinary approach involving elements such as

organizational structure, cultural factors, technologies and human resources Ebrahim 
(2006), Sasson and Ian (2006) and Plessis (2007). For Coffey and Hoffman (2003) and 
Garcia-Perez, Shaikh, Kalutarage and Jahantab (2015), through knowledge modeling it 
is possible to represent a complex system and the decision making inherent in that 
system. Finally, Nikulina and Khomenko (2015) mention that cognition management is a 
more productive way to help understand what is done to represent the best way to do it. 
Thus, the elicitation of tacit knowledge becomes an important element to be researched 
in a context involving Knowledge Based Systems (KBS), (Cairó & Guardati, 2012). 
The theme of this systematic review was to address the factors of the tacit 
knowledge elicitation process, based on indications of the need for theoretical deepening 
the topic found, for example, in Hoffman (2008), Abdul-Rahman, Wang and Siong 
(2011), Gavrilova and Andreeva (2012), Krishna and Busch (2012), Vásquez-Bravo, 
Segura, Domínguez and Amescua (2014), Rosario et al. (2015). 
Hao et al. (2017) explore the factors of the process of knowledge elicitation, but 
without discussing them in an integrated manner. Thus, this study aims to contribute to 
a greater understanding of the subject through the analysis and synthesis of previously 
defined research topics. In addition, it seeks to highlight future research opportunities, 
as well as propose theoretical support for research in an empirical context. The following 
research questions are formulated to address this objective: 
Research Question 1: “How is the state-of-the-art around the influence factors 
of the process of converting tacit to explicit knowledge from 2008 to 2020?" 
Research Question 2: "What are the future empirical research directions 
regarding the adoption of tacit knowledge elicitation techniques?" 
 
1.1 Investigation topics 
 
The section aims to establish some research topics underlying the research 
questions. Research topics are the factors that involve the process of eliciting tacit 
knowledge. In his research on the first essays towards the knowledge elicitation process, 
Hoffman (2008) addressed some points that were used as parameters to establish the 
first research topics that are related to the knowledge elicitation process, such as: Type

of interview with knowledge holder, Types of knowledge (declarative, procedural, and 
episodic) and Elicitation of individual and collective knowledge. 
Regarding the interview with the knowledge holder, Gavrilova and Andreeva 
(2012) propose a special agent (analyst) to facilitate the process of knowledge elicitation. 
Evidence of practical use of the agent has already been studied and can be found in 
studies such as Rosário et al. (2015). According to the authors, the agent is called the 
Knowledge Engineer and thus established the fourth research topic: Evidencing the 
indications of a Knowledge Engineer as a facilitator of the tacit knowledge elicitation 
process. 
The studies of Polanyi (1966,) show the dimension of tacit knowledge and the 
human limitations expected of a Knowledge Engineer, given the fact that the real 
dimension of human knowledge is limited to the ability to verbalize the knowledge in its 
entirety. Based on its premises, one of the challenges of this research arises, that is, to 
investigate the trends of the development of mechanisms that may be useful to deal with 
the difficulty of verbalizing knowledge. To this end, it becomes relevant to analyze the 
paradigm of the dimension of tacit knowledge thus establishing the fifth topic of 
investigation. 
In this scope, knowledge elicitation techniques are adopted to assist in the 
process of knowledge reuse and, as a consequence, promote organizational learning 
Preiss (2000), Kwong and Lee (2009) and Whyte and Classen (2012). For Hao Jia et al. 
(2017) knowledge elicitation techniques are adopted as a mechanism for the conversion 
of tacit knowledge to explicit knowledge, which can be adopted by the Knowledge 
Engineer as a way to maximize results in a process of elicitation of knowledge. However, 
what have been the recent trends in adopting these techniques? The sixth research topic 
addresses trends in the adoption of tacit knowledge elicitation techniques. For example, 
Hao Jia et al. (2017) indicate the Repertory Grid technique as an emerging alternative 
for eliciting tacit knowledge based on Abdul-Rahman, Wang and Siong (2011). When 
studying trends in the adoption of knowledge elicitation techniques, the scope of the 
techniques is an aspect to be considered. This review adopted the premise of Vásquez-
Bravo et. al. (2014) in which the process of knowledge elicitation comprises three 
phases: 1st) acquisition, 2nd) representation and 3rd) knowledge transfer. From this 
perspective, the authors Gavrilova and Andreeva (2012) and Vásquez-Bravo et al. 
(2014) indicate the importance of merging knowledge elicitation techniques, given their

limitations when adopted exclusively. Therefore, it is possible to promote 
complementarity between the techniques in promoting knowledge management. Hao Jia 
et al. (2017) complement this view by indicating the possibility of adopting hybrid 
methods for the process of eliciting tacit knowledge by stating that, “To study hybrid 
methods for tacit knowledge extraction, because the combination of multiple methods 
has the potential to overcome the disadvantages of a single method, Hao Jia et al. 
(2017)”. 
 However, it is understood that a systematic analysis of the trends in the adoption 
of tacit knowledge elicitation techniques is necessary in order to further highlight the 
scientific indications around this theme. Figure 1 represents the relationship between 
research question I and II and contextualized research topics. Table 1 represents the 
summary of the research topics underlying the research questions.

2 Methodology 
 
According to Boell and Kecmanovic (2015) and Templier and Paré (2015), the 
first step in planning a rigorous Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is the formulation of 
research questions, as they will be responsible for directing the research protocol. To 
this end, the introductory section contextualized the theme and established the research 
questions. The protocol adopted in this study was PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses), indicated by Moher, Eastwood, Rennie and 
Stroup (1999; 2009), in order to reduce the possibility of inconsistency in conducting the 
investigation. According to Moher et al. (2009), PRISMA consists of four phases to guide 
the development of the research protocol, 1st) database identification, 2nd) screening, 3rd) 
eligibility and 4th) inclusion criteria. 
The databases, Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus and Emerald Insight 
were chosen based on the possibility of finding articles from collections such as: Elsevier, 
Springer e Taylor & Francis. Search terms related to “knowledge Elicitation” are the 
following:   "knowledge Elicitation" OR "knowledge acquisition" AND technique AND 
“Tacit Knowledge". 
The selection criteria were based only on articles written in the English language 
and taking into consideration the period from 2008 to 2020. The choice of the starting 
date of the literature review period coincides with the studies of Hoffman (2008),

establishing the first research topics in relation to the process of knowledge elicitation. 
We selected the first ten articles, listed by database, by search term, based on the 
relevance criteria of each database. 
After the initial search, duplicity between the articles was analyzed. The eligibility 
criteria selected were articles from journals covered in JRC 2020 (Journal Citation 
Reports). For the inclusion criteria of previously validated articles, it was decided to 
analyze the abstract looking for a relationship with the research questions. The analysis 
was performed by two researchers with experience and knowledge of the central theme 
of the study and the inclusion criteria were: 
✓ 1st Approach to tacit knowledge as the central theme of the research; 
✓ 2nd Focus on techniques of knowledge elicitation. 
The number of articles selected in each step of the protocol is represented by 
Figure 2.

Understanding how the scientific community approaches the types of knowledge 
is important to establish the theoretical framework and direct future research. In this 
context, Xavier et al. (2013) report three types of knowledge: procedural, declarative and 
episodic. For Pattarawan, Brian and Patel (2016) and Rosso et al. (2018), tacit 
knowledge is a type of knowledge framed as procedural, in which it relates to action with 
the way the activity is performed. Xavier et. al. (2013) indicate that procedural knowledge 
can be framed as specific related to skill and psychomotor activity. Procedural knowledge 
was related to tacit knowledge in the work of Ting, Wang and Tse (2011) in Health Care, 
Yip and Lee, (2017) and Grandvallet, Pourroy, Prudhomme and Vignat (2017) in the 
manufacturing industry. Declarative knowledge is related to the facts that drive actions 
Leyer, Schneider and Claus (2016) and Pattarawan, Brian and Patel (2016). Declarative

knowledge fits in as short-term memory. Also according to Xavier et al. (2013), episodic 
knowledge is related to long-term memory. As a convergence of ideas Leu and Abbass 
(2016) and Leyer, Schneider and Claus (2016), they indicate that human cognition 
represents the interaction of the aforementioned types of knowledge. 
By inducing the knowledge holder to report episodic memories, one can identify 
characteristic elements of long-term memory, Brown, Bruza, Heard, Mengersen and 
Murray (2016). Furthermore, the authors report that the knowledge holder (expert) has 
the ability to retrieve episodic memories at a higher level than a non-specialist. This is 
attributed to the lack or little experience of the non-specialist, which implies dependence 
on short-term memory, since the non-specialist has limited episodic memory. According 
to Feldon, Franco, Chao, Peugh and Maahs-Fladung (2018), the expert manipulates 
both memory types, short and long-term memory. Short-term memory acts as the driving 
force of long-term memory, and episodic memory works as a link in this context. 
Establishing elements that can identify the presence of episodic memory in a process of 
knowledge elicitation may imply the quality of knowledge modeling, as it may assist in 
the selection of the expert, the knowledge holder (Brown et al., 2016). 
The classification of the elicitation of knowledge as individual and collective, third 
research topic, can help in the process of identification of the elicitation technique and 
the researcher's objective. Table 3 lists such applications.

Regarding the mechanism that enhances the results of knowledge elicitation, the 
role of the knowledge engineer as the fourth research topic was highlighted. In this 
context, there were indications such as: an agent with ability to model mental patterns 
(Berge et al., 2008), problem modeling (Compton, 2013; Akhavan, Shahabipour & 
Hosnavi, 2018), a mediator (Léger & Naud, 2009) and the need for communication skills 
(Xavier et al., 2013). 
Given the indications of socialization practices between knowledge holders and

knowledge engineer who is responsible for making the knowledge explicit in a structured 
way. The authors Zhang et al. (2009) and Alonso, Martínez, Pérez and Valente (2012) 
indicate the importance of the need for mutual collaboration between them. Finally, Leu 
and Abbass (2016) indicate that the knowledge engineer must observe the domain to be 
modeled before formal socialization with the knowledge holder. 
The dimension of tacit knowledge, the fifth research topic, is a challenging theme 
in a process of knowledge elicitation. The premise under analysis deals with the concept 
instituted by Polanyi (1966). Overall, the scientific community that addresses knowledge 
management remains respectful of the tacit knowledge dimension as a Polanyi 
paradigm. For example, Selwyn and Classen (2012), Pattarawan, Brian and Jignya 
(2016) and Grandvallet et al. (2017) mention that tacit knowledge is difficult to formalize 
and communicate. Pattarawan, Brian and Jignya (2016) state that they do not oppose 
the paradigm, considering that there are limitations regarding the process of eliciting tacit 
knowledge in its entirety. Other authors such as Mohamed, Chakraborty and Dehlinger 
(2016), Yip and Lee (2017), Centobelli, Cerchione and Esposito (2018) and Brösamle 
and Hölscher (2018), cite Polanyi as a reference to a context that addresses knowledge 
without considering the aspects related to the dimension of tacit knowledge and its 
characteristics. Therefore, as a contribution, it has been chosen to analyze the 
characteristics of tacit knowledge reported by Selwyn and Classen (2012), Rosário et al. 
(2015), Pattarawan, Brian and Jignya, (2016) and Rosso et al. (2018). The citations of 
the characteristics of tacit knowledge based on Polanyi are summarized by Table 4, 
observing a convergence in relation to the characteristic of tacit knowledge, intuition, 
schemas, perspectives, beliefs, procedural and cognitive dimension.

Regarding the use of tacit knowledge elicitation techniques, Zappavigna and 
Patrick (2010) state that they remained problematic from the perspective of the 
dimension of extracted knowledge. However, the prevalence of Polanyi's premise is 
observed, due to the lack of studies that direct actions to investigate the dimension of 
tacit knowledge.  
Only one survey found a counterpoint to Polanyi's premise. The authors, 
Zappavigna and Patrick (2010), state that Polanyi (1966) 's maxim,' We know more than 
we can say ', remains the dominant perspective in the literature regarding the assumption 
that tacit knowledge cannot be articulated and transmitted. However, Zappavigna and 
Patrick (2010) state that linguistic theory may be a counterpoint to Polanyi's premise. 
The research deepens the study in relation to the meaning of the term "saying", 
integrating the areas of linguistic theory and information systems. In this study, tacit 
knowledge was extracted through a grammar-oriented interview method, the Grammar-
targeted Interview Method (GIM), adopting systemic functional linguistics as a way of 
analyzing real time conversations. Zappavigna and Patrick (2010) propose an extension 
to Polanyi's model. "Knowledge can be" codified "in spoken speech because of the 
linguistic pattern employed in verbalization." The codification of verbalization from the 
point of view of linguistics and the information system, in turn, helps in the perception of 
the acquisition of tacit knowledge, and points a way for rediscussion in relation to 
Polanyi's paradigm.

3.3 Trend of adoption of Tacit Knowledge Elicitation Techniques 
 
Tacit knowledge elicitation techniques comprise one of the main factors explored 
by the review. The second research question deals with trend analysis in the adoption of 
techniques. To this end, the sixth and seventh research topics were established as 
shown in Figure 1. The research question stems from: "What are future empirical 
research directions regarding the adoption of tacit knowledge elicitation techniques?" 
The techniques found during the literature review are presented in Table 5. It is 
structured to represent the sources, techniques or methods, temporal analysis of 
citations (chronology), number of citations, classification in relation to the phases of the 
knowledge elicitation process, and the ranking of citations. The phases of the knowledge 
elicitation process for the study context were classified based on Vásquez-Bravo et al. 
(2014), which comprises the phases of Acquisition (A), Representation (R) and 
Knowledge Transfer (T).  
The descriptions of each phase were considered for the classification of 
knowledge elicitation techniques. In the phase of knowledge acquisition (A) there is 
socialization between the holder and the receiver of the knowledge. Representation (R) 
deals with the phase in which the inference and modeling of knowledge acquired through 
a platform corresponding to the reality of the environment in which the knowledge is 
inserted is promoted. Finally, the knowledge transfer phase (T) has the role of 
transmitting knowledge, that is, the way in which knowledge holders make decisions.

Knowledge elicitation techniques may be represented somewhere between the 
three phases of the knowledge elicitation process. The seventh research topic discusses 
the complementary or hybrid adoption of the techniques, given its limitations when 
adopted exclusively (Hao Jia et al., 2017). The researches that adopted as a strategy 
the complementary use of knowledge elicitation techniques are detailed in Table 6.

4 Discussion and future searches 
 
Assuming the need to provide instruments for the knowledge engineer, 
knowledge elicitation techniques play an important role in this context. Based on the 
classification of the most cited techniques in the literature according to Table 5, as well 
as considering the phases of the knowledge elicitation process. Based Vásquez-Bravo 
et al. (2014), the ways in which the techniques hypothetically can be integrated were 
projected.

4.1 Knowledge acquisition phase 
 
Durso, Kazi and Ferguson (2015), Mohamed, Chakraborty and Dehlinger (2016), Leu 
and Abbass (2016) and Grandvallet et al. (2017), indicate that the observation technique 
can be used to identify the strategies adopted. It can also be implemented to study motor 
skills or automated procedures to identify activities involved in solving a problem, as well 
as its constraints. The observation technique can be adopted as a form of prior learning 
of the knowledge engineer so that it can enhance their understanding of the process to 
be elicited. In this sense, it is recommended to use interview techniques after the 
observations, employing them, according to the objectives of the elicitation, such as the 
Critical Decision Method (CDM), pointed out by Rosso et al. (2018) and  Schnittker et al. 
(2019), as an alternative structured interview technique. Semi-structured and 
unstructured interviewing techniques can also be applied according to elicitation 
objectives, for example, repertory grid techniques, Card sorting, Brainstorming, 
Storytelling, Limited information, and Cognitive maps can be adopted in a 
complementary and concomitant manner of interviewing techniques. Among the 
aforementioned techniques, the repertory grid stands out, pointed out as an emerging 
alternative of tacit knowledge elicitation based on the indications of Abdul-Rahman, 
Wang and Siong (2011). According to the authors, the repertory grid technique was 
designed to extract the interviewee's traits and objects and classify them into categories 
through the interviewer's inference. This technique allows the elicitation of mental 
constructs, which represent the mental patterns formed during the lived experience. The 
premises that constitute the practical application of the repertory grid technique are: i) to 
understand the structure of the constructs, ii) to classify the elements as their degree of 
mental hierarchy; iii) to infer the relationship of the constructs and the elements. The 
structure of personal constructs may be understood using bipolar measurement scales.  
The inference about the elements and the constructs will occur in the analysis of 
knowledge leveling among the knowledge holders, where the elements are represented 
by the problem situation variables and the constructs represented by the measurement 
scale.

4.2 Knowledge representation and transfer phase 
 
The literature that approaches tacit knowledge in a perspective that involves its 
articulation, discusses the capture and codification of knowledge, for example, explored 
in Lazaric et al. (2003) and Oguz and Elif (2011). Knowledge is the modeling of the 
results of knowledge acquisition with the objective of codifying it. At this stage it is 
considered that knowledge will be articulated, a theme pointed out as the research 
direction by Lazaric et al. (2003), Oguz and Elif (2011) and Krishna and Busch (2012), 
adopted in the systematic review as one of the discussion elements, considering the 
sequencing of the knowledge elicitation process. On based on Vásquez-Bravo et al. 
(2014), the following are described techniques that can be employed in the phase of 
representation and transfer of knowledge and its articulations. 
Based on the results of the repertory grid application, exposed in the previous 
section, the classification of variables as their degree of mental hierarchy can be 
performed using the Cluster analysis technique based on Abdul-Rahman, Wang and 
Siong (2011). The authors adopted the techniques complementarily, as shown in Table 
6. The role of the cluster analysis technique is to organize the data semantically 
establishing the links between the main variables verbalized by the knowledge holders. 
In this context, integration between Repertory Grid and Cluster analysis can be 
recommended, for example, it can be found in Rosário et al. (2022). Based on Neil 
(1990), the use of dendrograms is suggested as a representation of links between the 
variable Thus the clusters will be represented by dendrograms, as a cognitive map, found 
in Nikas et al. (2017) and Akhavan, Shahabipour and Hosnavi (2018). The objectives of 
analyzing knowledge holders' mental patterns are twofold: I) to analyze the degree of 
similarity in knowledge between them, for example, as an Aggregate cognitive map, 
found in Kwong & Lee (2009); and II) to establish a degree of hierarchy between the 
variables. Based on the knowledge elicitation process, until the cluster analysis phase, 
it will be possible to establish the relationship of the occurrences of the conditional state 
variables, due to the links established by the dendrograms. The Bayesian Belieff Network 
(BBN) can be modeled based on the dendrograms, for example, it can be found in 
Rosário et al. (2022). BBN consists of a statistical model that represents a set of variables 
and their causal relationships as a function of their dependency links, and as a 
consequence, assists in decision making. For the purposes of the systematic review, the

Bayesian network represents a mechanism of knowledge representation and 
transference among knowledge holders, since it allows the realization of probabilistic 
simulations after modeling, based on the decision making elicitation, promoting the 
articulation of knowledge sharing. 
 
5 Conclusion 
 
The systematic review explored the factors that impact the tacit knowledge 
elicitation process. It was structured based on the indications of future works in a 
theoretical scope, which allowed a systematic exposure of the scope and complexity of 
the knowledge conversion process from tacit to explicit. It has been decided to broaden 
the debate around the process of converting individual epistemological tacit knowledge 
to organizational ontological explicit knowledge by establishing some alternatives for the 
empirical use of knowledge elicitation techniques employed in an integrated manner, 
given the indications of their fragility when adopted alone. A relevant point of the 
systematic review had been to propose the articulation of knowledge after the acquisition 
process, as there are indications in the literature about the need to approach this 
perspective. The paradigm of the dimension of knowledge was also a point discussed 
by the review. However, far from being exhausted, there was an indication of the need 
for future works that solidify the codification of the verbalization of knowledge through 
the analysis of linguistic patterns, a way to rediscuss the paradigm of the dimension of 
knowledge instituted by Polanyi. One of the factors that may help in this context is the 
projection of interviews with knowledge holders in order to stimulate the memory of 
episodic memories as a means of identifying tacit knowledge. Finally, the integration of 
knowledge elicitation techniques and the factors that involve this process was the central 
discussion of the systematic review, thus contributing to the scientific community when 
exposing the modeling alternatives of tacit knowledge as tactical knowledge-oriented 
propositions.
