The coordination of distributed energy resources (DERs) in power systems presents numerous challenges, particularly in agent-based approaches. These include the need for improved transmission and distribution system operator (TSO-DSO) coordination (Lind et al., 2019; Givisiez et al., 2020), addressing uncertainties in load and generation (Navidi et al., 2023), and integrating DERs for grid services like blackstart and volt-VAR optimization (Mukherjee et al., 2024). Multi-agent systems offer potential solutions for energy management in microgrids (Harb et al., 2014; Colson & Nehrir, 2011), but face challenges in scalability and real-time operation (Colson & Nehrir, 2011). The increasing penetration of DERs necessitates new coordination models and market structures (Birk et al., 2016). While human expertise modeling can enhance system validation (Knauf et al., 2005), its application to DER coordination remains unexplored in the reviewed literature. Overall, effective DER coordination requires addressing technical, economic, and regulatory barriers while ensuring grid reliability and stability.
