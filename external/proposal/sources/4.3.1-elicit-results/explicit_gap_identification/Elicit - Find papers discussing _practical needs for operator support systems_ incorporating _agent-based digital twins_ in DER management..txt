Recent research highlights the potential of digital twins (DTs) and agent-based systems in supporting operator decision-making for distributed energy resource (DER) management. DTs enable improved observability, controllability, and resilience in power systems (Brosinsky et al., 2024), while agent-based approaches offer flexibility and intelligent decision support (Ocker et al., 2021; Croatti et al., 2020). The integration of DTs with multi-agent systems (MAS) can enhance real-time decision-making and interaction in complex environments (Pretel et al., 2022). Cloud-edge hosted DTs facilitate coordinated control of DERs, reducing reliance on real-time communications (Han et al., 2023). DT-based frameworks for grid-integrated electric vehicles support independent decision-making and optimal incentive strategies (Yu et al., 2024). As distribution systems evolve towards distributed system platforms, Distribution System Operators (DSOs) are emerging as neutral market facilitators (Campos do Prado et al., 2019). These advancements address the practical needs for operator support systems in managing the increasing complexity of DER integration (Nguyen-Huu et al., 2022).
