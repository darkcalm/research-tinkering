Digital twins (DTs) in the energy sector face limitations regarding human factors integration. While DTs enable real-time monitoring and decision-making (Roy et al., 2024), they often lack consideration of human elements and interdependencies between assets (Bécue et al., 2020). Current challenges include data privacy, security, and ethical standards (Pietrantoni et al., 2024), as well as the need for improved human modeling and simulation (He et al., 2024). The concept of Human Digital Twins (HDTs) has emerged to address these limitations, aiming to integrate human aspects into DT frameworks (Naudet et al., 2021). However, research on security often presents DTs as an additional layer of protection without investigating their own security (Heluany & Gkioulos, 2023). To overcome these challenges, researchers propose holistic DT approaches (Bécue et al., 2020), open architecture frameworks (Gourisetti et al., 2023), and the integration of XR technologies (Roy et al., 2024) to enhance human-centric design and improve trust in DT applications.
