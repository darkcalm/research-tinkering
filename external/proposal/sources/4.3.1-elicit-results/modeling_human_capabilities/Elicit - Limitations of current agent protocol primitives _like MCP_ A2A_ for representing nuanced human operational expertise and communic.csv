Issues in Human–Agent Communication,"M. Barnes, Shan G. Lakhmani, E. Holder, Jessie Y.C. Chen",-,-,-,4,2019,"Current agent protocol primitives are limited in representing nuanced human operational expertise and communication patterns due to differences in reasoning processes, capabilities, and knowledge bases between humans and agents."
MCP: Learning Composable Hierarchical Control with Multiplicative Compositional Policies,"X. B. Peng, Michael Chang, Grace Zhang, P. Abbeel, S. Levine",-,-,Neural Information Processing Systems,183,2019,The paper proposes a method called multiplicative compositional policies (MCP) to learn reusable motor skills that can be composed to produce a large variety of complex behaviors.
