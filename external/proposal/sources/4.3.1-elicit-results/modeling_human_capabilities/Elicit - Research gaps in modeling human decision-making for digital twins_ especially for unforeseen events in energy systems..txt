Recent research highlights significant gaps in modeling human decision-making for digital twins in energy systems, particularly for unforeseen events. Digital twins offer promising solutions for optimizing energy systems and smart cities (Cali et al., 2023; Lamagna et al., 2021), but current models often lack comprehensive integration of behavioral and societal aspects (Huckebrink & Bertsch, 2021). Key challenges include data privacy, security, and sharing (Yazdanie & Orehounig, 2021), as well as real-time measurements and communication between physical and digital systems (Lamagna et al., 2021). To address these issues, researchers propose developing more integrated modeling approaches (Yazdanie & Orehounig, 2021), incorporating human factors and interdependencies between production assets (Bécue et al., 2020), and implementing interactive digital twins that translate decision-makers' preferences into optimization models (Granacher et al., 2022). Advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep neural networks, show potential for improving scheduling and cost savings in integrated energy systems (You et al., 2021; Sleiti et al., 2022).
