The methodological challenges in eliciting and formalizing tacit knowledge for AI systems in industrial operations are multifaceted. Capturing workers' tacit knowledge is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage and operational efficiency (Arévalo et al., 2022; Fenoglio et al., 2021). Challenges include modeling expert knowledge, quantifying uncertainty, and validating acquired knowledge (Arévalo et al., 2022). Various approaches have been proposed, such as intelligent assistants for systematic reflection (Samuel Kernan Freire et al., 2023), knowledge transfer frameworks (Arévalo et al., 2022), and cooperative games with domain ontologies (Fenoglio et al., 2021). Effective strategies involve visual stimuli, expert strategies analysis, and semi-structured interviews (Chervinskaya & Wasserman, 2000). Systematic task analysis methods have proven effective in eliciting tacit knowledge, particularly in visual inspection tasks (Johnson et al., 2019). However, the process remains time-consuming and may lead to inaccuracies in knowledge bases (Cooke & McDonald, 1986). Integrating cognitive psychology techniques and appropriate knowledge representation schemes can enhance the elicitation process (Cooke & McDonald, 1986).
