      "abstract": "Tata Power-DDL worked in collaboration with 3M on a pilot project for making the medium voltage distribution network smart and efficient. This project aimed at enabling real-time monitoring of electrical parameters such as voltage, current and reactive-power-flow. While enabling these features, it was vital to make the solution compact and retrofit-to-existinginfrastructure for saving cost in terms of reduced equipment\u2019s footprint. In this pilot project, electrical parameters and direction of power flow were accurately captured using sensor-based technology. Captured parameters and corresponding benefits are analyzed in detail in this paper. Further, the availability of real-time captured data can be potentially used through analytical tools for enabling many features such as predictive maintenance and identifying faulted-segments in underground cabling networks. Power-flow-direction can potentially be used for advanced protection coordination in the looped distribution network. Thus, enabling reliable integration of existing grid with distributed energy generation source."
