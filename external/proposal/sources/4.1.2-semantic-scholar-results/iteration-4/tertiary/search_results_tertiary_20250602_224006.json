      "abstract": "Nowadays, society and business rely heavily on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems, which are progressing faster than ever. To stay on pace with them, focus is shifted towards integration of individual ICT systems into complex systems, which offers more functionality than simply the sum of individual systems. In this regard, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) have gained significant importance and System-of-Systems (SoS) approach has been suggested for modeling complex CPSs to achieve a higher level goal, by dynamically building a large system with existing autonomous, and heterogeneous constituent systems (CSs). An important challenge in a system of Cyber-Physical Systems (SoCPSs) is to develop seamless collaboration between autonomous constituent-CPSs (CCPSs) to coordinate their operations. In this paper, we propose an agent based coordination mechanism to coordinate resource allocation and demand in SoCPSs. The approach models each CCPS as an agent and describes how multiple autonomous CCPSs, i.e., Virtual Power Plant (VPP), Commercial Greenhouse Growers (CGGs), communicate and collaborate with each other asynchronously through negotiation and how potential conflicts between CCPSs with conflicting goals are resolved. The efficacy of the proposed mechanism is validated through simulation of different real-world acyclic SoCPSs topologies. The results show that proposed approach is able to balance the individual requirements of multiple connected CPSs while achieving SoCPSs\u2019 mission."

      "abstract": "This paper deals with consensus in discrete-time multi-agent systems under directed networks subject to time-varying delays and input saturation. Because saturation might prevent multi-agent systems from attaining consensus, system analysis and controller design require the characterization of the allowed region for the initial conditions. The main contributions of this work are sufficient conditions for consensus analysis and design of distributed protocols for discrete-time systems. Moreover, the conditions lead to a procedure allowing an estimate of the region of attraction. Such a procedure considers the effect of current and delayed states separately, yielding broader estimates of the allowed region for initial conditions. The results follow from the transformation of the consensus problem into a stability problem, with the subsequent employment of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory. The conditions are formulated as convex optimization problems. Finally, the paper presents examples and comparisons with previous approaches to illustrate the validity of the proposed methods."
