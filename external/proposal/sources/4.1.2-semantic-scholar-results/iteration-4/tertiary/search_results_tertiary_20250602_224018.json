      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a coherent framework for multi-machine analysis, using a group clustering model, which can be utilized for predictive maintenance (PdM). The framework benefits from the repetitive structure posed by multiple machines and enables for assessment of health condition, degradation modeling and comparison of machines. It is based on a hierarchical probabilistic model, denoted Gaussian topic model (GTM), where cluster patterns are shared over machines and therefore it allows one to directly obtain proportions of patterns over the machines. This is then used as a basis for cross comparison between machines where identified similarities and differences can lead to important insights about their degradation behaviors. The framework is based on aggregation of data over multiple streams by a predefined set of features extracted over a time window. Moreover, the framework contains a clustering schema which takes uncertainty of cluster assignments into account and where one can specify a desirable degree of reliability of the assignments. By using a multi-machine simulation example, we highlight how the framework can be utilized in order to obtain cluster patterns and inherent variations of such patterns over machines. Furthermore, a comparative study with the commonly used Gaussian mixture model (GMM) demonstrates that GTM is able to identify inherent patterns in the data while the GMM fails. Such result is a consequence of the group level being modeled by the GTM while being absent in the GMM. Hence, the GTM are trained with a view on the data that is not available to the GMM with the consequence that the GMM can miss important, possibly even key cluster patterns. Therefore, we argue that more advanced cluster models, like the GTM, can be key for interpreting and understanding degradation behavior across machines and ultimately for obtaining more efficient and reliable PdM systems."

The HOVON-87/NMSG18 study was a randomized, phase 3 study in newly diagnosed transplant ineligible patients with multiple myeloma, comparing melphalan-prednisolone in combination with thalidomide or lenalidomide, followed by maintenance therapy until progression (MPT-T or MPR-R). The EORTC QLQ-C30 and MY20 questionnaires were completed at baseline, after three and nine induction cycles and six and 12 months of maintenance therapy. Linear mixed models and minimal important differences were used for evaluation. 596 patients participated in HRQoL reporting. Patients reported clinically relevant improvement in global quality of life (QoL), future perspective and role and emotional functioning, and less fatigue and pain in both arms. The latter being of large effect size. In general, improvement occurred after 6\u201312 months of maintenance only and was independent of the World Health Organisation performance at baseline. Patients treated with MPR-R reported clinically relevant worsening of diarrhea, and patients treated with MPT-T reported a higher incidence of neuropathy. Patients who remained on lenalidomide maintenance therapy for at least three months reported clinically meaningful improvement in global QoL and role functioning at six months, remaining stable thereafter. There were no clinically meaningful deteriorations, but patients on thalidomide reported clinically relevant worsening in neuropathy. In general, HRQoL improves both during induction and maintenance therapy with immunomodulatory drugs. The side effect profile of treatment did not negatively affect global QoL, but it was, however, clinically relevant for the patients. (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NTR1630)."

      "abstract": "General cognitive function is a prominent and relatively stable human trait that is associated with many important life outcomes. We combine cognitive and genetic data from the CHARGE and COGENT consortia, and UK Biobank (total N\u2009=\u2009300,486; age 16\u2013102) and find 148 genome-wide significant independent loci (P\u2009<\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22128) associated with general cognitive function. Within the novel genetic loci are variants associated with neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, physical and psychiatric illnesses, and brain structure. Gene-based analyses find 709 genes associated with general cognitive function. Expression levels across the cortex are associated with general cognitive function. Using polygenic scores, up to 4.3% of variance in general cognitive function is predicted in independent samples. We detect significant genetic overlap between general cognitive function, reaction time, and many health variables including eyesight, hypertension, and longevity. In conclusion we identify novel genetic loci and pathways contributing to the heritability of general cognitive function. Cognitive function is associated with health and important life outcomes. Here, the authors perform a genome-wide association study for general cognitive function in 300,486 individuals and identify genetic loci that implicate neural and cell developmental pathways in this trait."

      "abstract": "Background: Novel agents have recently questioned the role of both autotransplantation and consolidation therapy after intensification in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. We prospectively compared intensification with transplantation versus bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone (VMP), and bortezomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (VRD) consolidation versus no consolidation. \n \nMethods: In this randomized, open-label, phase 3 study we recruited previously untreated myeloma patients aged up to 65 years at 172 sites of the European Myeloma Network. Patients were first randomized (1:1) to VMP (4 cycles) or transplantation, and afterwards to VRD consolidation (2 cycles) or no consolidation, followed by lenalidomide-maintenance. Progression-free survival from first and second randomization were primary endpoints. Comparison of single versus double transplantation was a secondary endpoint. \n \nFindings: Between February, 2011 and April, 2014, 1503 patients were enrolled. Overall, 1197 patients were eligible for the first randomization: 702 received transplantation and 495 VMP; 877 patients underwent the second randomization: 449 received VRD consolidation and 428 no consolidation. Progression-free survival from first randomization was significantly better with transplantation than with VMP (median, 56\u00b77 versus 41\u00b79 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b773, 95% CI 0\u00b762-0\u00b785, p=0\u00b70001). VRD consolidation prolonged median progression-free survival from second randomization compared with no consolidation (58\u00b79 versus 45.5 months; HR 0\u00b777, 95% CI 0\u00b763-0\u00b795, p=0\u00b7014). Overall survival estimates at 5 years were 75% with transplantation and 71\u00b76% with VMP (HR 0\u00b790, 95% CI 0\u00b771-1.13, p=0\u00b735). Double transplantation significantly prolonged progression-free survival (HR 0\u00b774, 95% CI 0\u00b756-0\u00b798, p=0\u00b7036) and overall survival (HR 0\u00b762, 95% CI 0\u00b741-0\u00b793, p=0\u00b7022) compared to a single transplantation. The rate of at least one grade \u22653 adverse event was 88% with transplantation versus 52% with VMP. Transplant-related mortality was 1%. \n \nInterpretation: In newly diagnosed myeloma patients, intensification therapy with transplantation significantly prolonged progression-free survival compared with VMP, although overall survival was similar. After intensification, VRD consolidation significantly improved progression-free survival compared with no consolidation. \n \nTrial Registration: This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01208766. \n \nFunding Statement: The Dutch-Belgian Cooperative Trial Group for Hematology Oncology (HOVON) sponsored and designed this study.

      "abstract": "We assessed the predictive capacity of the HCV-MOSAIC risk score, originally developed for primary early HCV infection, as a screening tool for HCV reinfection in 103 men who have sex with men (MSM) with HIV using data from the MOSAIC cohort, including MSM with HIV/HCV-coinfection who became reinfected (cases, n = 27) or not (controls, n = 76) during follow-up. The overall predictive capacity of the score was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. The effects of covariates on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were assessed using parametric ROC regression. The score cut-off validated for primary early infection (\u22652.0) was used, from which the sensitivity and specificity were calculated. The AUROC was 0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.63\u20130.84). Group sex significantly increased the predictive capacity. Using the validated cut-off, sensitivity was 70.4% (95%CI = 49.8\u201386.2%) and specificity was 59.2% (95%CI: 47.3\u201370.4%). External validation from a cohort of 25 cases and 111 controls, all MSM with HIV, resulted in a sensitivity of 44.0% (95%CI = 24.4\u201365.1) and specificity of 71.2% (95%CI = 61.8\u201379.4). The HCV-MOSAIC risk score may be useful for identifying individuals at risk of HCV reinfection. In sexual health or HIV-care settings, this score could help guide HCV-RNA testing in MSM with a prior HCV infection."

      "abstract": "Many railway assets suffer increasing wear and tear during operation. Prognostics can assist diagnosis by assessing the current health of a system and predicting its remaining life based on features that capture the gradual degradation in a system\u2019s operational capabilities. Prognostics are critical to improve safety, plan successful work, schedule maintenance, and reduce maintenance costs and down time. Unlike fault diagnosis, prognosis is a relatively new area, but it has become an important part of Condition-based Maintenance (CBM) of systems. As there are many prognostic techniques, usage must be attuned to particular applications. Broadly stated, prognostic methods are either data-driven or model-based. Each has advantages and disadvantages; consequently, they are often combined in hybrid applications. A approach hybrid model can combine some or all model types (data-driven, and phenomenological); thus, more complete information can be gathered, leading to more accurate recognition of the fault state. This approach is especially relevant in railway systems where the maintainer and operator know some of the failure mechanisms, but the complexity of the infrastructure and rolling stock is huge that there is no way to develop a complete model-based approach. Therefore, hybrid models are extremely useful for accurately estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of railway systems. The paper addresses the process of data aggregation into a hybrid model to get RUL values within logical confidence intervals so that the life cycle of railway assets can be managed and optimised."

      "abstract": "The Hamburg City Health Study\u00a0(HCHS) is a large, prospective, long-term, population-based cohort study and a unique research platform and network to obtain substantial knowledge about several important risk and prognostic factors in major chronic diseases. A random sample of 45,000 participants between 45 and 74\u00a0years of age from the general population of Hamburg, Germany, are taking part in an extensive baseline assessment at one dedicated study center. Participants undergo 13 validated and 5 novel examinations primarily targeting major organ system function and structures including extensive imaging examinations. The protocol includes validate self-reports via questionnaires regarding lifestyle and environmental conditions, dietary habits, physical condition and activity, sexual dysfunction, professional life, psychosocial context and burden, quality of life, digital media use, occupational, medical and family history as well as healthcare utilization. The assessment is completed by genomic and proteomic characterization. Beyond the identification of classical risk factors for major chronic diseases and survivorship, the core intention is to gather valid prevalence and incidence, and to develop complex models predicting health outcomes based on a multitude of examination data, imaging, biomarker, psychosocial and behavioral assessments. Participants at risk for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, stroke and dementia are invited for a visit to conduct an additional MRI examination of either heart or brain. Endpoint assessment of the overall sample will be completed through repeated follow-up examinations and surveys as well as related individual routine data from involved health and pension insurances. The study is targeting the complex relationship between biologic and psychosocial risk and resilience factors, chronic disease, health care use, survivorship and health as well as favorable and bad prognosis within a unique, large-scale long-term assessment with the perspective of further examinations after 6\u00a0years in a representative European metropolitan population."

      "abstract": "General cognitive function is a prominent human trait associated with many important life outcomes1,2, including longevity3. The substantial heritability of general cognitive function is known to be polygenic, but it has had little explication in terms of the contributing genetic variants4,5,6. Here, we combined cognitive and genetic data from the CHARGE and COGENT consortia, and UK Biobank (total N=280,360). We found 9,714 genome-wide significant SNPs (P<5 \u00d7 10\u22128) in 99 independent loci. Most showed clear evidence of functional importance. Among many novel genes associated with general cognitive function were SGCZ, ATXN1, MAPT, AUTS2, and P2RY6. Within the novel genetic loci were variants associated with neurodegenerative disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, physical and psychiatric illnesses, brain structure, and BMI. Gene-based analyses found 536 genes significantly associated with general cognitive function; many were highly expressed in the brain, and associated with neurogenesis and dendrite gene sets. Genetic association results predicted up to 4% of general cognitive function variance in independent samples. There was significant genetic overlap between general cognitive function and information processing speed, as well as many health variables including longevity."

      "abstract": "\n \n EKM, AM and MD contributed equally to this work.\n BACKGROUND. Despite major advances in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) in the past two decades, outcomes remain heterogenous, with some patients being primary refractory and others being long-term non-progressors. There is still an unmet need to identify patients at risk for early relapse/progression (ER) upfront to tailor new treatment strategies and improve outcomes in this population.\n METHODS. This analysis included data from 10843 patients with newly diagnosed (ND)MM treated in 16 international, multicenter clinical trials from 2005 to 2016. Data were collected by the European Myeloma Network (EMN) within the HARMONY Platform (www.harmony-alliance.eu) supported by the European Hematology Association (EHA).\n The primary endpoint was a landmark analysis of overall survival (OS) starting from 18 months after randomization in patients with and without ER within 18 months from MM diagnosis (ER<18). ER<18 as an independent factor and baseline factors associated with ER<18 were analyzed in multivariable models. An additive scoring system to predict ER<18 was developed based on a clinical and statistical selection of MM disease parameters. High-risk cytogenetic abnormalities (HRCA) were defined as either del(17p), t(4;14), t(14;16) or +1q21. Patients who were censored (n=442) or died without progressive disease within the first 18 months (n=661) were excluded from the analyses.\n RESULTS. A total of 9740 patients were available for the landmark analyses at 18 months from MM diagnosis (median follow-up: 72 months, IQR 58-87), 1970 of whom had an ER<18 (1254 deaths), 7051 had no ER<18 (2392 deaths) and 719 had died with progressive disease within the first 18 months. OS at 18 months from MM diagnosis was significantly shorter in patients with ER<18 vs those without ER<18 (median OS: 48 [95% CI 46-51] vs 115 months [95% CI 109-122], HR 3.32, 95% CI 3.10-3.56, p<0.0001). In a multivariable model including 2768 complete patient cases, ER<18 was an independent prognostic factor (HR 2.79, 95% CI 2.60-3.00, p<0.0001), along with established prognostic factors such as International Staging System (ISS) stage III (vs I: HR 1.83, 95% CI 1.65-2.02, p<0.0001), HRCA (vs standard risk: HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.58-1.99, p<0.0001) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; yes vs no: HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.20-1.43, p<0.0001).\n ER<18 was significantly associated with single-hit HRCA (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.27-1.83, p<0.0001) and double-hit HRCA (OR 2.87, 95% CI 2.24-3.68, p<0.0001). Other factors associated with ER<18 were ISS stages II and III (II: OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.35-1.72, p<0.0001; III: OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.79-2.37, p<0.0001) and elevated LDH (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.21-1.56, p<0.0001). Treatment with a proteasome inhibitor plus an immunomodulatory agent vs only one of the two drug classes significantly reduced the risk of ER<18 (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.42-0.53, p<0.0001). The dissection of HRCA in a similar multivariable model revealed that double-hit HRCA involving del(17p) had the overall strongest association with ER<18 (OR 3.32, 95% CI 2.29-4.81, p<0.0001), followed by single-hit del(17p) (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.59-3.17, p<0.0001).\n An additive scoring system for ER<18 identified single-hit HRCA (1 point), double-hit HRCA (2), ISS II (1), ISS III (2) and elevated LDH (1) as significant MM disease-specific parameters. Patients with low (0-1 points, 47% of patients), intermediate (2-3, 44%) and high (4-5, 9%) counts had gradually increasing and statistically significant different risks for ER<18 of respectively 18% (reference), 33% (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.92-2.78, p<0.0001) and 49% (OR 4.51, 95% CI 3.37-6.04, p<0.0001). Among patients with ER<18, the three risk categories retained their prognostic impact, with a median OS at 18 months from MM diagnosis of 68 (95% CI 56-89), 41 (95% CI 37-46) and 29 months (95% CI 25-34) in the low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups, suggesting OS heterogeneity even among functional high-risk MM patients.\n CONCLUSIONS. Our unique, large dataset of NDMM patients confirmed the unmet need for patients with ER<18 and brought to light the adverse prognostic impact of del(17p) as single- or double-hit HRCA. Although it did not account for all patients with ER<18, the accumulation of established MM-specific risk factors was associated with an increasing risk for ER<18, and MM-specific risk factors retained their prognostic significance among functional high-risk patients.\n"

      "abstract": "Background: Several population-based studies on multiple myeloma (MM) have shown an improvement in relative survival (RS) for patients aged 65 years or younger at the time of diagnosis. In patients aged 75 years or older, the improvement in long-term RS is absent in most reports or much less pronounced. To our knowledge, only 2 studies based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database have demonstrated a significant increase in RS for this age-group. (Pulte et al. 2011, Costa et al. 2017) We performed a population-based study on Norwegian MM-patients to provide up-to-date estimates on changes in relative survival during the past 3 decades.\n Methods: The Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN) was established in 1951 and provides high-quality nationwide cancer statistics. For MM, the reported completeness of case-ascertainment is above 95%. Incidence data and all reported cases of MM diagnosed between January 1, 1982 and December 31, 2017 were retrieved from the CRN (n=10 961). Nationwide drug consumption statistics for drugs used in myeloma treatment were retrieved from the Norwegian Drug Wholesales Statistics and the Norwegian Prescriptions Database, Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Follow-up ended December 31, 2017. The time of MM-diagnosis was divided into 7 categories: 1982-1987, 1988-1992 (melphalan-prednisone), 1993-1997(early high-dose melphalan with autologous stem-cell transplant (HDM-ASCT)), 1998-2002 (introduction of thalidomide), 2003-2007 (early thalidomide upfront, introduction of bortezomib), 2008-2012 (thalidomide and bortezomib upfront, introduction of lenalidomide), 2013-2017 (lenalidomide upfront, early pomalidomide, daratumumab, panobinostat and carfilzomib). Age at diagnosis was divided into 3 categories; <65 years, 65-79 years and 80 years or older. We estimated relative survival ratios (RSR) with 95% confidence intervals 5 and 10 years after the time of diagnosis by the Ederer-II method. The analysis was stratified by age-group and calendar period of diagnosis. Cohort analysis was applied to calendar periods with complete follow-up, and period analysis was applied where complete-follow up was not available (2013-2017 and 10-year estimates for 2008-2012). Non-overlapping confidence intervals were considered statistically significant.\n Results: The age-standardized incidence rate was stable until approximately year 2000, followed by an increasing tendency reaching 8.4 cases per 100 000 persons in 2017. Figure 1. Patients diagnosed before the age of 65 had a steady increase in both 5 and 10-year RSR across all calendar periods. For patients aged 65-79 years, the 5- and 10-year RSR's were stable at approximately 0.3 and 0.1, respectively, until the calendar period 1998-2002. In the following years, an improvement in both 5- and 10-year RSR was observed. The 5-year RSR improved significantly from 0.31 (95% CI; 0.27-0.35) in the first calendar period to 0.43 (95% CI;0.39- 0.47) during 2008-2012. The predicted 5-year RSR for 2013-2017 was 0.48 (95% CI; 0.44-0.52). There were also signs of improved 10-year RSR, predicted to 0.23 (95% CI; 0.18-0.27) during 2013-2017 compared to 0.11 (95% CI; 0.08-0.14) during 1982-1987. The 5-year RSR for patients aged 80+ years was 0.11 (95% CI; 0.01-0.17) during 1982-1987 and the 10-year RSR was 0.03 (95% CI; 0.01-0.11). In the following 4 calendar periods the RSR-estimates fluctuated before a rising tendency during the last 2 periods. The 5-year RSR improved significantly to 0.26 (95% CI; 0.20-0.32) during 2008-2012 and further rising to a predicted value of 0.32 (95% CI; 0.25-0.38) during 2013-2017. Figure 2. Additionally, complete annual prescription statistics for the oral agents thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide were obtained.\n Conclusions: We provide real-world observations on changes in RS in a population-based cohort of 10 961 MM-patients. We demonstrate an improvement in 5-year relative survival across all age-groups, including patients aged 80 years or older. For patients <65 years, there was a steady increase in RS since 1982 and we see no obvious impact of the implementation of HDM-ASCT. For the other age-groups, the improvement in RS coincides with the introduction of new drugs. The increase in incidence since 2000 may be due to increased testing for M-protein. We can point to the introduction of new drugs and increased incidence of indolent cases as possible reasons for increasing RS.\n \n \n \n No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.\n"

      "abstract": "Background: Healthcare-associated infection (HAI) surveillance is essential for most infection prevention programs and continuous epidemiological data can be used to inform healthcare personal, allocate resources, and evaluate interventions to prevent HAIs. Many HAI surveillance systems today are based on time-consuming and resource-intensive manual reviews of patient records. The objective of HAI-proactive, a Swedish triple-helix innovation project, is to develop and implement a fully automated HAI surveillance system based on electronic health record data. Furthermore, the project aims to develop machine-learning\u2013based screening algorithms for early prediction of HAI at the individual patient level. Methods: The project is performed with support from Sweden\u2019s Innovation Agency in collaboration among academic, health, and industry partners. Development of rule-based and machine-learning algorithms is performed within a research database, which consists of all electronic health record data from patients admitted to the Karolinska University Hospital. Natural language processing is used for processing free-text medical notes. To validate algorithm performance, manual annotation was performed based on international HAI definitions from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Sepsis-3 criteria. Currently, the project is building a platform for real-time data access to implement the algorithms within Region Stockholm. Results: The project has developed a rule-based surveillance algorithm for sepsis that continuously monitors patients admitted to the hospital, with a sensitivity of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85\u20130.93), a specificity of 0.99 (0.98\u20130.99), a positive predictive value of 0.88 (0.83\u20130.93), and a negative predictive value of 0.99 (0.98\u20130.99). The healthcare-associated urinary tract infection surveillance algorithm, which is based on free-text analysis and negations to define symptoms, had a sensitivity of 0.73 (0.66\u20130.80) and a positive predictive value of 0.68 (0.61\u20130.75). The sensitivity and positive predictive value of an algorithm based on significant bacterial growth in urine culture only was 0.99 (0.97\u20131.00) and 0.39 (0.34\u20130.44), respectively. The surveillance system detected differences in incidences between hospital wards and over time. Development of surveillance algorithms for pneumonia, catheter-related infections and Clostridioides difficile infections, as well as machine-learning\u2013based models for early prediction, is ongoing. We intend to present results from all algorithms. Conclusions: With access to electronic health record data, we have shown that it is feasible to develop a fully automated HAI surveillance system based on algorithms using both structured data and free text for the main healthcare-associated infections.

      "abstract": "The pharmaceutical industry is an important contributor to the health of the UK economy, with 65 000 people directly employed and many more in support industries [1]. It delivered a net trade surplus of \u00a32.6 billion to the UK economy in 2002 and was rated as the highest value-adding industry, with \u00a378 000 of value added to the economy per industry employee in the same period. It is a highly competitive global industry with significant high-risk, long-term investment in increasingly costly drug discovery and development activity. It takes ~10\u201312 years to bring a new medicine to market and the average development cost is \u00a3350 million, with high attrition rates. The rewards are high for successful transnational players, with pre-tax profits of 30% on sales [2]. The industry presents particular challenges to occupational health practitioners engaged in the delivery of effective occupational health services. The demands of a highly technical work environment must be blended with the need to maintain effective health management in a fast-paced, changing and pressured global business climate. This, combined with a high level of focus on innovation and productivity through human capital development strategies, provides a rich mix of factors to take into account when selecting and implementing health interventions that are appropriate, risk-targeted, cost-effective and acceptable to employees and management. An overview of health hazards in the industry published in 1947 provides a familiar list of headings and exposure issues to today\u2019s pharmaceutical occupational health practitioner. The contemporary collection of reviews in this issue of Occupational Medicine provides an update: so, has anything changed beyond the product names that populate the lists of recognized causes of exposure-related health effects? [3] Providing rational, risk-based advice on the prediction, prevention and management of exposure-related health effects from a diverse and novel range of workplace health hazards requires increasingly specialized technical competences and industry knowledge. Binks reviews occupational toxicology and the control of exposure to pharmaceutical agents at work [4]. He provides insight into the high level of resource investment and multidisciplinary expertise applied to predicting the potential adverse effects of occupational exposure. The industry has pioneered occupational hazard categorization systems and led the way in developing novel approaches to the containment of highly potent biologically active substances. Heron and Pickering review the published evidence for health effects related to exposure to active pharmaceutical ingredients [5]. The literature continues to be dominated by well-known historical clusters of occupational illness burden associated with particular classes of drug compounds and there is a paucity of recently published data. Is this a cause for optimism that the battle has been won? Laboratory animal allergy (LAA) remains an important and potentially life-threatening cause of occupational sensitization, often with significant career implications for those affected. Gordon and Preece [6] present a summary of the state of the art in preventing this condition. They offer encouragement that investment in a policy-driven integrated approach to allergen exposure control can result in a reduction in incidence. The lower level of importance of occupational health interventions, such as health surveillance, compared to other components of LAA risk management systems is noted. However, occupational health practitioners remain well placed to play a key role in facilitating and co-ordinating the Director, Southern Client Services, Aon Health Solutions, 2 Circus Place, London EC2M 5RS, UK.

      "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is often over expressed in ovarian cancer (OVCA), promoting ascites and effusions. Preclinical studies of inhibition of VEGF and its receptors (VEGFR) show activity in OVCA xenografts. Clinical interest in evaluating VEGF (R) inhibition was triggered when the Gynecologic Oncology Group demonstrated single agent activity of the VEGF targeted antibody, bevacizumab (BEV) in recurrent OVCA. Since that time, BEV and small molecular VEGFR inhibitors have been studied in numerous phase II and III trials in OVCA. Randomized BEV trials are the most mature with results reported in first line (GOG218, ICON7), platinum sensitive recurrent disease (OCEANS trial) and platinum resistant recurrent disease (AURELIA trial) settings. All trials gave concurrent chemotherapy + BEV with some providing maintenance BEV after chemotherapy. All have shown a biological effect of the addition of BEV with higher response rates and longer progression free survival (PFS) in BEV arms. To date, no trial has shown overall survival (OS) improvement, although mature analyses for OS are awaited. Quality of life data have not suggested a benefit with BEV and toxicity is greater. Results of phase III trials of VEGFR inhibitors cedarinib, pazopanib and nintedanib are awaited. The BEV results lead to several important questions: 1) in the absence of significant OS improvement to date, is there sufficient patient benefit from PFS increases to warrant incorporation of BEV into ovarian cancer treatment? And when over the course of the disease should the agent be given? 2) Is the use of BEV cost effective and affordable? 3) Which patient subset is benefiting most? Subgroup analysis of the ICON7 study, suggests that patients with greater bulk disease (Stage III> 1 cm residual and Stage IV) seem to derive more PFS benefit. Indeed in this subgroup, overall survival also was improved. However, in the GOG0218 trial, the hazard ratio for PFS was observed to be better in patients with < 1 cm residual. Some have suggested VEGF A plasma levels may be predictive of BEV benefit, but no results from the BEV OVCA trials are yet published. In summary, clinical results to date show significant PFS improvements from BEV in 4 trials, but it is unclear if this will translate into improved OS and how best and in whom BEV should be used in OVCA management. Disclosure: The author has declared no conflicts of interest."

Purpose Haptoglobin (Hp) is an innate antioxidant and scavenges haemoglobin. In humans, Hp is present in three major genotypes: Hp 1-1, 2-1, and 2-2. The antioxidant ability of Hp is genotype-dependent. Hp 2-2 has previously been associated with a progressive decline in renal function and enhanced risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. In renal transplant recipients no previous data exist regarding the infl uence of Hp genotype. The aim of this study was to examine the relation between Hp genotype, graft loss, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in renal transplant recipients. Methods In a cohort of 1989 Norwegian renal transplant recipients Hp genotype was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. Follow-up data on graft loss, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality were registered in a validated database (Norwegian renal registry). Data were analyzed using a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. Results Median follow-up was 5.1 years with 432 (21.7%) events. When divided in three groups according to Hp genotype no difference was seen between groups regarding graft-loss, cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. In a multivariate analysis, adjustment for the following variables: age, gender, estimated glomerular fi ltration rate, body mass index, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, time on dialysis, transplant number, donor age, living donor, HLA-DR mismatches, cholesterol and number of anti-hypertensives, did not alter the results. Multivariate analysis for graft loss or death: Hp 2-2 (ref), Hp 2-1 (HR 1.13 (0.92-1.39), p 0.25) and Hp1-1 (HR 0.97 (0.71-1.3), p 0.82). Conclusion In a large cohort of renal transplant recipients with long-term follow-up, Hp genotype did not infl uence graft loss, cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. Abstract# C1775 Endothelial Progenitor Cells in Kidney Transplant Patients. F. Damiano,1 G. Ligabue,1 S. De Biasi,2 M. Granito,1 A. Cossarizza,2 G. Cappelli.1 1Dept of Surgery, Medicine, Dentistry and Morphological Scienses, University Hospital of Modena, Nephrology Unit, Modena, Italy; 2Dept of Surgery, Medicine, Dentistry and Morphological Scienses, University of Modena & Reggio Emilia,, Modena, Italy. Background: Circulating bone-marrow derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) promote vascular repair. Lower concentrations of EPCs correlate with cardiovascular risk. In uremic patients, the number of functionally active EPCs is reduced. Kidney transplantation (KTx) improves both survival and endothelial function in patients with advanced renal failure. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of KTx and immunosuppressive therapy on the number of EPCs. Methods: EPCs were measured by fl ow cytometry analysis in 51 renal transplant patients (52\u00b113,92 years; mean eGFR 52,61\u00b119,90 ml/min) and 25 healthy subjects (49\u00b115 years; mean eGFR 94\u00b123 ml/min). We examined the associations between counts of EPCs and traditional cardiovascular risk factors, uremia related risk factors, kidney function and immunosuppressive agents. Results: EPCs numbers were similar in Kidney transplant recipients and controls. We found signifi cant (p<0.05) independent inverse associations between counts of EPCs and age, sistolic and diastolic blood pressure and C-Reactive Protein (CRP). Renal transplant recipients with reduced graft function (mean eGFR <30 ml/min) had lower EPCs counts compared with healthy volunteers(1,05-05 \u00b1 1,17-05 vs.3,9504 \u00b1 8,35-04 as % on 5x106 PBMc; p=0,0105). Patients receiving regimen therapy including corticosteroids showed signifi cantly lower EPCs number (1,77-02\u00b1 1,24-02 vs.6,74-04 \u00b1 9,77-04 as % on 5x106 PBMc; p<0,0001). The use of Cyclosporine and Everolimus induced a further decrease in EPCs number compared to Cyclosporine and Mycophenolate (7,70-05 \u00b1 1,65-04 vs.6,74-04 \u00b1 9,77-04 as % on 5x106 PBMc; p=0,0044). Conclusions: EPCs numbers in KTx are comparable to those found in healthy subjects. In addition, this study suggests negative associations in KTx between EPC counts and age, blood pressure, CRP, graft function and use of some immunosuppressive drugs combination. These fi ndings indicate an improved potential for endothelial repair after KTx, suggest a different effect from different anti-rejection drugs and emphasize the role of EPCs as marker of endothelial health and predictors of cardiovascular outcomes.

Abstract# C1776 Osteoporosis and Fractures After Solid Organ Transplantation: A Nationwide Population-Based Case-Control Study. T. Yu,1,2 C. Kao.2 1Internal Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan; 2Clinical Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan. Objectives: Metabolic bone disease after solid organ transplantation (SOT) is becoming an important complication to consider in chronic transplant patients. However, few population studies have described long-term outcomes of osteoporosis and related fractures after SOT. Therefore, we devoted to investigate the prevalence of bone disorders after SOT and to compare the risk of different SOT in a nationwide population-based study. Methods: We used Taiwan\u2019s National Health Insurance Research Database to identify 9,535 solid organ transplant recipients and 38,140 gender and age matched-control subjects to compare the incidence and risk of bone disorders in both groups. Results: Patients with SOT had a signifi cantly higher incidence rate of osteoporosis and related fractures as compared to the non-SOT group. The overall hazard ratio of osteoporosis after transplantation for SOT patients was 5.36 (95% CI= 3.298.72) as well as HR of related fractures was 6.07(95% CI =4.039.16) after adjustment. The highest sexand age-specifi c HR were observed in the male patients (HR=7.79, 95% CI=3.46-17.5) and those with an age \u226450 years (HR=7.46, 95% CI=2.50-22.3). In addition, SOT patients without any comorbidity had an 8.96-fold higher risk of developing osteoporosis than non-SOT subjects (HR=8.96, 95% CI=5.25-15.3). To compare the risk of osteoporosis and related fractures among different SOT patients, the highest risk of osteoporosis as well as fractures was noted among patients receiving lung transplantation followed by other types of SOT. Conclusion: In the study, we report unacceptably high rates of metabolic bone disorders after SOT in chronic transplant patients over a long follow-up period. Pre-transplant bone disorders and immunosuppressant agents are supposed to be involved with metabolic disorders after transplantation.
