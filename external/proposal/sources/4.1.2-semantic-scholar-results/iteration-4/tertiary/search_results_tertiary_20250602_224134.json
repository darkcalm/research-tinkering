      "abstract": "The prevalence of the Internet of things (IoT) and smart meters devices in smart grids is providing key support for measuring and analyzing the power consumption patterns. This approach enables end-user to play the role of prosumers in the market and subsequently contributes to diminish the carbon footprint and the burden on utility grids. The coordination of trading surpluses of energy that is generated by house renewable energy resources (RERs) and the supply of shortages by external networks (main grid) is a necessity. This paper proposes a hierarchical architecture to manage energy in multiple smart buildings leveraging federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL) with dynamic load in a distributed manner. Within the context of the developed FDRL-based framework, each agent that is hosted in local building energy management systems (BEMS) trains a local deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model and shares its experience in the form of model hyperparameters to the federation layer in the energy management system (EMS). Simulation studies are conducted using one EMS and up to twenty smart houses that are equipped with photovoltaic (PV) systems and batteries. This iterative training approach enables the proposed discretized soft actor-critic (SAC) agents to aggregate the collected knowledge to expedite the overall learning procedure and reduce costs and CO2 emissions, while the federation approach can mitigate privacy breaches. The numerical results confirm the performance of the proposed framework under different daytime periods, loads, and temperatures."

      "abstract": "Smart power grids (SGs) enhance efficiency, reliability, and sustainability by integrating distributed energy resources (DERs) such as solar panels and wind turbines. A key challenge in SGs is managing home battery charging during periods of insufficient renewable energy generation to ensure fairness, efficiency, and customer satisfaction. This paper introduces a secure reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for optimizing battery charging coordination while addressing privacy concerns and false data injection (FDI) attacks. Privacy is preserved through Federated Learning (FL), enabling collaborative model training without sharing sensitive State of Charge (SoC) data that could reveal personal routines. To combat FDI attacks, Deep Learning (DL)-based detectors are deployed to identify malicious SoC data manipulation. To improve FL efficiency, the Change and Transmit (CAT) technique reduces communication overhead by transmitting only model parameters that experience enough change comparing to the last round. Extensive experiments validate the framework\u2019s efficacy. The RL-based charging coordinator ensures fairness by maintaining SoC levels within thresholds and reduces overall power utilization through optimal grid power allocation. The CAT-FL approach achieves up to 93.5% communication overhead reduction, while DL-based detectors maintain high accuracy, with supervised models reaching 99.84% and anomaly detection models achieving 92.1%. Moreover, the RL agent trained via FL demonstrates strong generalization, achieving high cumulative rewards and equitable power allocation when applied to new data owners which did not participate in FL training. This framework provides a scalable, privacy-preserving, and efficient solution for energy management in SGs, offering high accuracy against FDI attacks and paving the way for the future of smart grid deployments."

      "abstract": "The increased integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) results in a two-way dynamic operation of the power distribution grid. Consequently, conventional Protection, Automation, and Control (PAC) systems are not able to manage DER related constraints in the distribution grid. New Fault location, Isolation, and service Recovery (FLISR) schemes based on communication capabilities are gaining a lot of momentum. Together with the 5th generation of mobile networks (5G), they improve the reactivity and the coordination of the grid defense lines. In this context, we present in this paper a FLISR traffic management framework in 5G Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) networks. Our framework consists first in optimizing the placement of FLISR protection functions within the Radio Access Network (RAN). Then, a joint routing and link scheduling of FLISR traffic in the 5G-RAN is proposed by taking into account the energy consumption. To achieve this, we formulate the master problem as two correlated integer linear programs (ILP) and present an optimal solution to solve it. Our objective is to find the best trade-off between the achieved network throughput and energy consumption, while ensuring the latency constraint of FLISR traffic. Our approach is compliant with the Software-Defined Radio Access Network (SD-RAN) paradigm since it can be integrated as a control flow application on top of a SD-RAN controller. Through a case study, we show that our proposed approach achieves significant gains in terms of energy consumption, flow acceptance and achieved network throughput, compared to baseline routing and placement strategies."

      "abstract": "Actions under this plan will result in a common specification for price. This specification will be used in demand response applications, market transactions, distributed energy resource integration, meter communications, and many other inter-domain communications. Businesses, homes, electric vehicles, and the power grid will benefit from automated and timely communication of energy prices, characteristics, quantities, and related information. Price is a number associated with product characteristics, including delivery schedule, quality (reliability, power quality, source, etc.), and environmental and regulatory characteristics. Price also is a common abstraction for abundance, scarcity, and other market conditions. A common price model will define how to exchange data on energy characteristics, availability, and schedules to support efficient communication of information in any market. Why Coordination of energy supply and demand requires a common understanding of supply and demand. A simple quotation of price, quantity, and characteristics in a consistent way across markets enables new markets and integration of distributed energy resources. Price and product definition are key to transparent market accounting. A consistent information model will reduce implementation costs. A consistent model for market information exchange simplifies communication flow and improves the quality and efficiency of actions taken by energy providers, distributors, and consumers. Better communication of actionable energy prices facilitates effective dynamic pricing and is necessary for net-zero-energy buildings, supply-demand integration, and other efficiency and sustainability initiatives. Common, up-to-the-moment pricing information is also an enabler of local generation and storage of energy, such as electric-charging and thermal-storage technologies for homes and buildings. Major Objectives \u2022 Develop a summary of power reliability and quality characteristics that affect price and availability (supply side) and desirability (demand side). \u2022 Survey existing price communications and develop harmonized specification (review by October 2009, draft specification by April 2010). \u2022 Engage the broad group of stakeholders into the effort. \u2022 Build on existing work in financial energy markets and existing demand response programs. \u2022 Integrate with schedule and interval specifications under development (see section 5.3).

      "abstract": "As part of a sustainable power system, a synergy between electric mobility and renewable energy sources (RESs) can play a crucial role on mitigating the nature of RESs and defer costly grid upgrades via smart-charging. This paper presents a distributed autonomous control architecture for electric vehicle (EV) chargers and a clustering method for charging coordination. The architecture framework is detailed depending on the number of chargers and specific location properties. Moreover, the framework unveils the communication, measurement and power flow. The aforementioned approach aims at simplifying the overall charging experience for the EV owners while coupling it with a healthy grid behavior. The proposed control architecture is simulated on a prosumer case with two EVs. The performance of the controller is considerably affected by observability capabilities of current smart-meters. Faster measurement cycles of smart-meters can reduce the overshoot time span but not prevent it."

To fully understand the interdependency between them, we propose to integrate the Network Simulator 3 (NS3) into the High Engine for Large-Scale Infrastructure Co-Simulation (HELICS), a new open-source, cyber-physical-energy co-simulation platform. This paper aims to the development and case study of the HELICS-based high performance distribution-communication co-simulation framework for the DER coordination. The novel co-simulation framework for the NS3 integrating into the HELICS is developed. The DER monitoring application about hybrid smart grid communication network design is simulated and validated on this proposed HELICS-based cyber-physical co-simulation platform."

      "abstract": "This work involves the development of a device - EmSense (\u201cEmulated Sensor\u201d) - that emulates a high-resolution sensor for a power grid. The device collects raw current and voltage sensor data which derive from ORNL's signature library. This library is a dataset that ORNL curates from many different sources that include power systems from various utilities. The EmSense packages the data from the library in the form of IEC 61850 Sampled Value (SV) packets and then broadcasts these SV packets on the network. In another mode, EmSense can generate artificial sinusoidal data that appears as waveforms for voltage and current signals. EmSense has an internal algorithm for determining the period of a signal based on the data so that the period can be specified as a variable in the IEC 61850 packets. The purpose of EmSense is to allow for experimentation with the Dark Net Infrastructure where a variety of power line sensors must be represented along with their typical communication traffic. The EmSense device was developed in coordination with the software for receiving and processing the packets in the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) framework of the DarkNet Project. This receiving software must have a methodology for dealing with information of high velocity, variety, and volume. Experimenting with EmSense facilitates the development of such software. The results showed that the DLT framework and the trust-anchoring approach managed to process a large flow of traffic even with up to six instances of EmSense device broadcasting data. This was achieved without overfilling packet queues in the memory of the actual hardware of the DLT devices or causing the Central Processing Unit (CPU) of the hardware to be overwhelmed. The DLTs were also able to store the data in a compact and useful form for later analysis and archival purposes."

      "abstract": "Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) play a pivotal role in transportation electrification. The flexible nature of PEVs\u2019 charging demand can be utilized for reducing charging cost as well as optimizing the operating cost of power and transportation networks. Utilizing charging flexibility of geographically spread PEVs requires design and implementation of efficient optimization algorithms. There is a synergy between electro mobility (e-Mobility) infrastructures (including charging stations) and PEVs. In this paper, we introduce a holistic framework to model interdependent nature of power systems and electrified transportation networks, enhance the operational performance of these systems as a network-of-networks, and explain the required information exchange via coupling agents (e.g., PEVs and charging stations). We develop a holistic framework that enables distributed coordination of interdependent networks through the IoT lens. To this end, we propose to use a fully distributed consensus+innovations approach. This iterative algorithm achieves a distributed solution of the decision making for each agent through local computations and limited communication with other neighboring agents that are influential in that specific decision. For instance, the optimal routing decision of a PEV involves a different set of agents as compared with the optimal charging strategy of the same PEV. The exogenous information from an external network/agent can affect internal operation of the other agents. For instance, having some information about traffic congestion at the transportation networks changes the decision of PEVs to charge their battery at another location. Our approach constitutes solving an iterative problem, which utilizes communication at the smart city layer, as a network of infrastructures, including power grid and electrified transportation network, that enables fully distributed coordination of agents. Fully distributed decision making enables scalability of the solution and plug-and-play capability, as well as increasing the information privacy of PEVs by only requiring limited local information exchange with neighboring agents. We investigate a detailed application of our framework for interdependent power systems and electrified transportation networks. To this end, we first identify the functionalities, constraints, objectives, and decision variables of each network. Then, we investigate the interdependent interactions among these networks and their corresponding agents."

      "abstract": "The exponential growth of distributed energy resources is enabling the transformation of traditional consumers in the smart grid into prosumers. This transition presents a promising opportunity for sustainable energy trading. However, the integration of prosumers in the energy market imposes new considerations in designing unified and sustainable frameworks for efficient use of the power and communication infrastructure. Furthermore, several issues need to be tackled to adequately promote the adoption of decentralized renewable-energy-oriented systems, such as communication overhead, data privacy, scalability, and sustainability. In this article, we present the different aspects and challenges to be addressed for building efficient energy trading markets in relation to communication and smart decision making. Accordingly, we propose a multi-level pro-decision framework for prosumer communities to achieve collective goals. Since the individual decisions of prosumers are mainly driven by individual self-sufficiency goals, the framework prioritizes the individual prosumers' decisions and relies on the 5G wireless network for fast coordination among community members. In fact, each prosumer predicts energy production and consumption to make proactive trading decisions as a response to collective-level requests. Moreover, the collaboration of the community is further extended by including the collaborative training of prediction models using federated learning, assisted by edge servers and prosumer home area equipment. In addition to preserving prosumers' privacy, we show through evaluations that training prediction models using federated learning yields high accuracy for different energy resources while reducing the communication overhead."

      "abstract": "This report outlines National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\u2019s validation tools developed to help address the smart grid\u2019s emergent needs and complement research and standards coordination efforts. Rapid advances have enabled an opportunity for the grid to autonomously and simultaneously control generation, balance load, and regulate power quality. The grid will need this coordinated control to regulate power and voltage in realtime, to meet fast-changing power demands, especially with increasing distributed energy resources. To do this, the grid needs measurements from across the distribution network to accurately assess demand and prevent negative impact of variable grid-edge generation. Additionally, such a coordinated control system depends on a new operating paradigm with two-way information flows between domains of the grid. The different operational domains and the information flows between them are outlined in the NIST Framework and Roadmap of Smart Grid Interoperability Standards, Release 4.0 [1]. The coordinated control mentioned above requires improved observability of the state of distributed resources and depends on marshalling increasingly decentralized control systems. To implement such a system and meet system level performance objectives, distribution system operators (DSOs) need an understanding of the bandwidth, security and integrity considerations while also ensuring reliability at the grid\u2019s edges. Industry is also concerned with how to represent uncertainties like latency and cyber-vulnerabilities in a complex cyber-physical system. Additionally, industry is concerned that standards are focused more on devices than on coordinated control systems. Thus, this report presents an overview of a data acquistion and control system designed by NIST as a validation tool and deployed on the NIST campus in Gaithersburg, MD. This system is comprised of interoperating computing resources, cybersecurity infrastructure, communication links and data interfaces to both take measurements and to transmit control inputs to commonly used distribution system control components. An important proof of concept included in the aforementioned validation system is a data pipeline optimized to stream data from a 5 MW PV inverter and multiple sources of synchronized phasor data. This pipeline utilizes industry standard information modeling and communication standards with the intent of being compatible with industry standard testing equipment. This capability demonstrates how DSOs could test current standards against functionality \u2014 such as phasor based control of distribution circuits. Assumptions and Assessment of Needs The research presented in this report is motivated by these assumptions: 1. The grid is evolving towards coordinated control of distributed energy resources. 2. Formal methods to quantify uncertainty in power systems will be standardized across the DSO community. i _____________________________________________________________________________________ This puication is avilable ree of carge rom : https://rg/10.6028/N IST.TN .173 3. Industry standards and testing protocols will evolve to capture system-level performance. An assessment of the current situation indicates that it is computationally infeasible to fully model and centralize the control of distribution system operations, especially given the uncertainties associated with distributed generation. However, it may be possible to improve computational feasibility using approximation tools such as reachability analysis for planning and modeling. Recent state-of-the-art methods may enable coordinated control of distributed energy resources. These include optimization-based methods and consensus\u2013based controls. Regarding standards and testing, NIST assesses that standards-setting organizations (SSOs) are in the early stages of working with industry to develop precise and accepted system-level interoperability test methodologies [2] and that these efforts will be positively impacted with the availability of validation and analysis tools tailored to distribution circuits. Areas of research and development for validation The NIST Smart Grid Program has initiated several research projects to address the gap in validation and test tools. These projects include efforts to harmonize information models to help DSOs integrate groups of distributed energy resources on their primary and secondary feeders into an existing Distribution Management System (DMS). Researchers at NIST are developing an Adaptive Reference Governor scheme to assist in distributed control of constrained distributed energy resources (DERs). This Reference Governor is a control strategy that predicts the evolution of the system state to enforce pre-specified constraints on the inputs, states or the outputs of a system. Additionally, NIST is using its expertise in electrical metrology and test design to develop software libraries, calibration methods and automated test software to meet validation needs for controlling distributed energy resources. Campus capabilities for validation This research is performed using the facilities of NIST campus in Gaithersburg, Maryland. These include a distribution network with four 13.8 kV feeders that span the campus. In addition to a local power utility, this network is supplied by two large on-site, distributed generators in addition to four smaller generators. Nodal state variables such as voltage and current magnitude, real and reactive power are reported to a central database, along with some power quality measurements such as total harmonic distortion, frequency, and power factor. Measurements are acquired at terminal nodes. A 400 Mbps data pipeline for inverter and phasor data was implemented to meet the needs of emerging research needs. The pipeline captures time-aligned data from multiple sites enabling researchers to monitor and respond to fast occurring events. NIST researchers have used the capabilities of the streaming pipeline to validate an AdaptiveContractive Reference Governor for constraint aware fast responding power converters. ii _____________________________________________________________________________________ This puication is avilable ree of carge rom : https://rg/10.6028/N IST.TN .173"

      "abstract": "Microgrids play a major role in enabling the widespread adoption of renewable distributed energy resources. However, as the power generated from renewable resources is intermittent in nature, it impacts the dynamics and stability of the microgrid, and hence their integration needs new approaches to coordination and control. The existing systems lack run-time adaptive behavior. To face these constraints, the electric energy system must adapt by integrating Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Multiagent system (MAS) is emerging as an integrated solution approach to distributed computing, communication, and data integration needs for smart grid application. Distributed and heterogeneous information can be efficiently processed locally, but utilized globally to coordinate distributed knowledge networks, resulting in reduction of information processing time and network bandwidth. Parallel operations, asynchronous communication, and autonomous actions of agents enable MAS to adapt to dynamic changes of the environment, thereby improving the reliability, responsiveness, fault tolerance, and stability of the microgrid. In this chapter, MAS is implemented with Java Agent DEvelopment (JADE) framework for advanced energy management of a microgrid. Also, MAS is linked with Arduino microcontroller for practical verification of agent operations. Three microgrids are interconnected to form a microgrid testbed, and smart grid features such as demand side management and plug and play are implemented, making it into a smart microgrid."
