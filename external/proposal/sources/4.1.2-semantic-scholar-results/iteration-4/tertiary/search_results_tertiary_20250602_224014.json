      "abstract": "Designing effective collaboration structure for multi-agent LLM systems to enhance collective reasoning is crucial yet remains under-explored. In this paper, we systematically investigate how collaborative reasoning performance is affected by three key design dimensions: (1) Expertise-Domain Alignment, (2) Collaboration Paradigm (structured workflow vs. diversity-driven integration), and (3) System Scale. Our findings reveal that expertise alignment benefits are highly domain-contingent, proving most effective for contextual reasoning tasks. Furthermore, collaboration focused on integrating diverse knowledge consistently outperforms rigid task decomposition. Finally, we empirically explore the impact of scaling the multi-agent system with expertise specialization and study the computational trade off, highlighting the need for more efficient communication protocol design. This work provides concrete guidelines for configuring specialized multi-agent system and identifies critical architectural trade-offs and bottlenecks for scalable multi-agent reasoning. The code will be made available upon acceptance."

      "abstract": "Multi-UAV systems typically require complex in-frastructure to deploy in real-world scenarios, limiting their accessibility and scalability. In addition, current research often relies on custom solutions or proprietary hardware to facilitate inter-UAV communication. In this paper, we propose an open-source, low-cost, plug-and-play solution to enable decentralized UAV-to-UAV communication over 2.4GHz Wi-Fi using a con-nectionless protocol. Our approach simplifies the deployment of decentralized systems by allowing UAVs to easily exchange any type of binary data, seamlessly interfacing with ROS2. The solution uses an ad-hoc style network that allows UAVs to join or leave dynamically without requiring centralized governance or a priori configuration. We describe the architecture of the system, assess the network performance in an outdoor environment using UAVs, and evaluate the system's ability to share information as a swarm through hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) and experiments using UAVs. Our results show that the proposed system facilitates connectivity and is able to transmit mission-critical data for real-world UAV operations. HITL experiments show that a decentralized planning algorithm running on three simulated UAVs can effectively reach consensus on decentralized task allocation. We have made the code public and thus provide a viable solution for researchers seeking to implement decentralized UAV swarms using cost-effective commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and minimal infrastructure."

      "abstract": "Introduction: In H.U.Donostia (Gipuzkoa) we identified multi-pathological patients with repeated admissions due to the same process. We wondered how to avoid it and design the first studies. Description of practice change implemented: Evolution of an integration strategy based on person-centered care incorporating liaison nurse, primary and hospital care and hospital at home service (HaH). Impact of new technologies. Aim: Improving patients\u2019 quality of live. Training patients and healthcare providers. Optimizing the use of healthcare resources. Establishment of objectives and care directives. Target population: - Multi-pathological patients with high readmission rates due to HF and/or COPD. - Home-dependent patients. - Nursing home residents. Timeline: 2007-2008: before-after preliminary study with a multipronged strategy (EMAI) on HF with high readmission rates. 2008-2009: RCT: EMAI vs EMAI + telemedicine. 2009-2010: before-after study with a multipronged strategy (PAMI) targeting patients with high readmission rates. 2010-2011: cluster RCT: PAMI in nursing homes. 2014-2015: RCT: PAMI vs PAMI+web. 2017: RCT: PAMI vs PAMI+osarean. 2017: cluster RCT in home-dependent patients: PAMI vs PAMI+web/APP. Highlights: - Preliminary study with multi-intervention EMAI (assignment of a liaison nurse and a hospital-based specialist, structured telephone support, communication with the GP and appointment with the hospital-based specialist):\u00a0 80% reduction in the number of bed days and in the attendances to the Emergency Department (ED) compared to the previous year. - PAMI: extension of the previous study with implementation of the multidisciplinary care programme with direct telephone line for maximum accessibility. 60.7% reduction in the number of bed days and 77% in the attendances to the ED compared to the previous year. High adherence to treatment and patient perceived good quality of care. - With reduction in-patient bed days, increased consultations. Adding telemedicine to PAMI reduced the use of health resources, without impact on the quality of life, but not being cost-effective. - Adapting PAMI to patients living in nursing homes: reduction in ED attendances and an exchange of inpatients bed days for days cared by HaH without differences in mortality. - Implementing PAMI with a web-based self-care programme during one year:\u00a0 no differences in terms of mortality, visits to the ED, hospital admissions or quality of live. - The liaison nurse call was replaced by a call-center (Osarean) compared to classical PAMI: a decrease in visits to the ED (4%) and days of admission (3%) and an increase in stays in HaH and hospital visits. - Implementing PAMI with a self-care programme (web or APP) in home-dependent patients: pending results. Sustainability: Reorganizing healthcare system would allow optimizing actual resources Transferability: The technology and protocols are available to all in the Basque Country. Conclusions: Our multipronged strategy demonstrated its efficacy to manage better patients with high rates of readmissions or those with dependency (at home and nursing homes). Discussion: A unified clinical history accessible to all the agents involved and improving the communication channels would make the strategy more efficient. Lessons learned: Training both patients and professionals and accessibility to the health system are the main keys in the future to manage multi-pathological patients."

      "abstract": "Future wireless networks will need to support diverse applications (such as extended reality), scenarios (such as fully automated industries), and technological advances (such as terahertz communications). Current wireless networks are designed to perform adequately across multiple scenarios so they lack the adaptability needed for specific use cases. Therefore, meeting the stringent requirements of next-generation applications incorporating technology advances and operating in novel scenarios will necessitate wireless specialized networks which we refer to as SpecNets. These networks, equipped with cognitive capabilities, dynamically adapt to the unique demands of each application, e.g., by automatically selecting and configuring network mechanisms. An enabler of SpecNets are the recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), which allow to continuously learn and react to changing requirements and scenarios. By integrating AI/ML functionalities, SpecNets will fully leverage the concept of AI/ML-defined radios (MLDRs) that are able to autonomously establish their own communication protocols by acquiring contextual information and dynamically adapting to it. In this paper, we introduce SpecNets and explain how MLDR interfaces enable this concept. We present three illustrative use cases for wireless local area networks (WLANs): bespoke industrial networks, traffic-aware robust THz links, and coexisting networks. Finally, we showcase SpecNets' benefits in the industrial use case by introducing a lightweight, fast-converging ML agent based on multi-armed bandits (MABs). This agent dynamically optimizes channel access to meet varying performance needs: high throughput, low delay, or fair access. Results demonstrate significant gains over IEEE 802.11, highlighting the system's autonomous adaptability across diverse scenarios."
