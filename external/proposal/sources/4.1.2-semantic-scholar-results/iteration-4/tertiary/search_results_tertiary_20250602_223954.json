      "abstract": "We consider a decentralized optimization problem, in which $n$ nodes collaborate to optimize a global objective function using local communications only. While many decentralized algorithms focus on \\emph{gossip} communications (pairwise averaging), we consider a different scheme, in which a ``token'' that contains the current estimate of the model performs a random walk over the network, and updates its model using the local model of the node it is at. Indeed, token algorithms generally benefit from improved communication efficiency and privacy guarantees. We frame the token algorithm as a randomized gossip algorithm on a conceptual graph, which allows us to prove a series of convergence results for variance-reduced and accelerated token algorithms for the complete graph. We also extend these results to the case of multiple tokens by extending the conceptual graph, and to general graphs by tweaking the communication procedure. The reduction from token to well-studied gossip algorithms leads to tight rates for many token algorithms, and we illustrate their performance empirically."

In this context, SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems are an essential infrastructure. This paper presents a conceptual design of a communication and resources management scheme based on an intelligent SCADA with a decentralized, flexible, and intelligent approach, adaptive to the context (context awareness). The methodology is used to support the energy resource management considering all the involved costs, power flows, and electricity prices leading to the network reconfiguration. The methodology also addresses the definition of the information access permissions of each player to each resource. The paper includes a 33-bus network used in a case study that considers an intensive use of distributed energy resources in five distinct implemented operation contexts."

This approach couples Quality Function Deployment, elements of the Systems Engineering Process, a centralized or decentralized decision mechanism, and an ongoing performance measurement system. The approach can be applied during conceptual design to eliminate system design solutions that prove to be deficient and/or provide excess capacity. A hypothetical example consisting of a simplified network communication system is presented to illustrate a complete application of the approach. This research shows that the Integrated Decision Approach can be used to resolve certain decision problems that involve publicly shared systems as effectively as the best of the centralized mechanisms but with less time and analysis required. \u00a9 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

      "abstract": "Thousands of drone operations are expected over urban areas in different countries, as drones bring economic and societal benefits. However, it raises problems regarding unmanned traffic management, including safety, regulatory, security, automatization, communication, and scalability aspects. How can we provide decentralized services for drone traffic management that are compliant with the regulatory framework? We identified some requirements from the European U-space regulation and applied the Systems Development Methodology. We devised a permissioned blockchain-based architecture, Services as smart contracts, and a simple consensus mechanism named Appointed-by-Authority as conceptual contributions. The practical one is a working software named U-spaceChain. It is a proof-of-concept of a blockchain in which smart contracts provide Flight Authorization, Network Identification, Traffic Information, Conformance Monitoring, Geo Awareness, Weather Information, and Common Information services. It is compliant with regulations, secure by design, can support the development of new services, and the concepts can be reused in other domains. We also designed enablers that allow testing this proof-of-concept by creation and then simulation of drone traffic. U-spaceChain may be a reference for the research and application of blockchain to the drone traffic management domain."

      "abstract": "In this communication, conceptual design guidelines for a tri-band dual sense circularly polarized ceramic-based antenna is explored. An asymmetrical S-shaped aperture is used to stimulate the ring-shaped ceramic. Some exclusive features are obtained in the designed antenna: (i) creation of five different hybrid modes (HEM11\u03b4 , HEM11\u03b4+2, HEM12\u03b4-like, HEM12\u03b4 , and HEM13\u03b4) is helpful for getting dual wideband impedance bandwidth; (ii) proposed aperture assists in achieving CP waves in three different frequency ranges with two different senses. Its experimental results confirm the simulated outcomes. The proposed antenna is operated within the dual-frequency ranges, i.e., 2.2\u20134.19 GHz and 4.74\u20136.11 GHz, respectively. The measured 3-dB axial ratio is achieved in three different frequency ranges within the operating band, i.e., 2.71\u20132.98 GHz, 3.6\u20133.79 GHz, and 5.5\u20135.81 GHz, respectively. The proposed antenna design is left-handed circularly polarized (LHCP) in the first and third frequency ranges, while it is right-handed in the second one. These features, along with broadsided far-field patterns, recommend the proposed antenna design for potential application in WLAN (2.4/5.5 GHz) and WiMAX (3.3/5.0 GHz) wireless networks."
