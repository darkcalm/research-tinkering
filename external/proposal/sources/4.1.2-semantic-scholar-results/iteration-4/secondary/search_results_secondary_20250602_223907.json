However, these systems face fundamental challenges in context management, coordination efficiency, and scalable operation. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for advancing multi-agent systems through Model Context Protocol (MCP), addressing these challenges through standardized context sharing and coordination mechanisms. We extend previous work on AI agent architectures by developing a unified theoretical foundation, advanced context management techniques, and scalable coordination patterns. Through detailed implementation case studies across enterprise knowledge management, collaborative research, and distributed problem-solving domains, we demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to traditional approaches. Our evaluation methodology provides a systematic assessment framework with benchmark tasks and datasets specifically designed for multi-agent systems. We identify current limitations, emerging research opportunities, and potential transformative applications across industries. This work contributes to the evolution of more capable, collaborative, and context-aware artificial intelligence systems that can effectively address complex real-world challenges."

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of secure consensus tracking control for nonlinear leader-follower multi-agent systems, with a specific focus on safeguarding followers\u2019 private information from external network eavesdroppers or internal untrusted neighbors. To tackle this problem, we first employ the dynamic linearization approximation technique to transform the nonlinear system models into equivalent linear forms that involve unknown time-varying pseudopartial derivatives. Then, a novel model-free secure distributed adaptive control (MFSDAC) framework is proposed using an encoding-decoding mechanism and Paillier encryption. Within this framework, we develop a secure distributed control scheme using a recursive form and design an adaptive updating law with a modified projection to estimate the time-varying pseudoparial derivatives. To enhance security, we introduce an adjustable parameter and a random integer into the distributed communication protocol, effectively preventing the disclosure of followers\u2019 data during both network transmissions and controller evaluations. Additionally, parameter selection rules for the controller, quantizer, and adaptive updating law are provided, along with convergence analysis and guarantees against quantizer saturation. Finally, numerical simulations confirm that the proposed MFSDAC framework successfully achieves leader-following tracking and secure data transmission, even in the presence of external network eavesdroppers or internal untrusted neighbors. Note to Practitioners\u2014Multi-agent systems (MASs) provide a versatile framework for modeling and understanding various real-world applications, including autonomous systems, traffic management, and distributed sensor networks. Designing effective control strategies for MASs is essential to enhance cooperation and coordination among agents, strengthen system-level resilience and adaptability, and tackle complex tasks that surpass the capabilities of individual agents. A key challenge in this area is ensuring network security and protecting individual privacy, especially in the presence of external eavesdroppers and untrusted internal neighbors. To tackle this challenge, we propose a model-free secure distributed adaptive control framework for nonlinear leader-follower MASs. This framework incorporates a confidential communication protocol that leverages homomorphic encryption to protect sensitive information. The proposed framework has undergone rigorous stability analysis and been validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness in achieving secure consensus control of nonlinear MASs."

      "abstract": "In this study, we address the challenge of time-varying formation control in multi-agent systems (MASs) in the presence of time-varying intra- and inter-agent communication delays. To tackle time-varying delays, we equip each agent with a bank of distributed observers to estimate its own and its neighbors\u2019 states. We apply dynamic periodic event-triggered mechanisms to both sensor-to-observer (S-O) and controller-to-actuator (C-A) channels, aiming to reduce unnecessary data transmissions in the network by relying on locally triggered sampled data in a distributed fashion to enhance resource efficiency. In the design stage, we transform the state formation control problem into an asymptotic stability problem. Using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) approach, we design the event-triggering parameters such that the closed-loop system of all agents is stable and agents reach the desired formation. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our approach achieves a balance by reducing inter-agent communication frequency while maintaining the desired formation. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of this approach through experiments on a real-world robotic system. Note to Practitioners\u2014In practical applications of multi-agent systems, the use of a communication network introduces some challenging issues. To name a few, periodic sampling with a high frequency relies on heavy transmission of information between components, which may result in network congestion. Factors such as limited bandwidth, signal attenuation, and packet losses contribute to delays in networked MAS. Additionally, network security, protocols, buffering, processing, and transmission times play significant roles. Since network-induced delays depend heavily on variable network conditions, they are generally non-uniform and time-varying. This paper proposes a solution for formation control in MASs, considering communication delays, and holds practical implications across various industries. It can enhance coordination for tasks such as warehouse logistics and collaborative manufacturing in autonomous robotics. Drone swarms can benefit from more efficient and reliable movement coordination, impacting surveillance and precision agriculture. In industrial automation, synchronization among machines or robotic arms can be improved for increased efficiency. A noteworthy aspect of this paper is the validation of our results through experiments on a real-world multi-robot system, demonstrating broad applicability."

      "abstract": "This paper studies the generic architecture and coordination mechanism of an FIPA (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents) compliant heterogeneous multi-agent system (MAS) in a distributed control scenario. Proposed generic MAS framework has been applied to a real-time traffic detection and management system. The agent-based real-time traffic detection and management system (ABRTTDMS) is designed for the information fusion of different traffic detection systems on highways to optimize real-time traffic detection and management. ABRTTDMS is a multi-level agent system. The lowest level agents are responsible for processing the real-time traffic data and monitoring traffic conditions. The middle level agents coordinate all of the lowest level agents in a subnetwork. The highest-level agent is located in the transportation management center (TMC) to accept human commands and delegate tasks to lower level agents. The re-configurable hybrid control architecture of the system provides the capability of dynamically grouping distributed heterogeneous agents (intelligent control systems) into virtual clusters to accomplish tasks related to different geographical areas and different purposes. A platform independent agent execution engine has been implemented using an embeddable C/C++ interpreter called Ch. The communication between agents that reside on different hosts has been simulated in the Integration Engineering Laboratory at the University of California, Davis. The use of agent technology greatly enhances the distributed computing and cooperation capabilities of traffic detection and management systems.Copyright \u00a9 2004 by ASME"

      "abstract": "The rise of large model-based AI agents has spurred interest in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for their capabilities in decision-making, collaboration, and adaptability. While the Model Context Protocol (MCP) addresses tool invocation and data exchange challenges via a unified protocol, it lacks support for organizing agent-level collaboration. To bridge this gap, we propose Agent-as-a-Service based on Agent Network (AaaS-AN), a service-oriented paradigm grounded in the Role-Goal-Process-Service (RGPS) standard. AaaS-AN unifies the entire agent lifecycle, including construction, integration, interoperability, and networked collaboration, through two core components: (1) a dynamic Agent Network, which models agents and agent groups as vertexes that self-organize within the network based on task and role dependencies; (2) service-oriented agents, incorporating service discovery, registration, and interoperability protocols. These are orchestrated by a Service Scheduler, which leverages an Execution Graph to enable distributed coordination, context tracking, and runtime task management. We validate AaaS-AN on mathematical reasoning and application-level code generation tasks, which outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, we constructed a MAS based on AaaS-AN containing agent groups, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) workflows, and MCP servers over 100 agent services. We also release a dataset containing 10,000 long-horizon multi-agent workflows to facilitate future research on long-chain collaboration in MAS."

      "abstract": "In the realm of Natural Disaster Management (NDM), timely communication with local authorities is paramount for an effective response. To achieve this, multi-agent systems play a pivotal role by proficiently identifying and categorizing various disasters. In the field of Distributed Deep Neural Network (D-DNN) inference, such approaches often require DNN nodes to transmit their results to the cloud for inference, or they necessitate the establishment of a fixed topology network to enable inference directly on the edge, a practice prone to security risks. In this work, we propose a decentralized inference strategy tailored for fire classification tasks. In this approach, individual DNN nodes communicate within a network and enhance their predictions by considering other DNN node inference outputs that contribute to improving their individual performance. The overall coordination of the system on a specific decision is achieved through a consensus protocol, which acts as a universally accepted inference rule adopted by all DNN nodes operating within the system. We present a comprehensive experimental analysis, of the forest-fire classification task, focusing on enhancing both individual DNN node performance and the stability of the consensus protocol."
