        "abstract": "The explosive increase in sensory equipment for the gathering of data in recent years has pushed computing resources to their limits and has created the need for a more decentralized approach in Big Data Analytics. The term Edge Computing refers to this new paradigm where computation is performed away from the traditional cloud, in a more distributed manner and physically closer to the actual gathering of data. However, in large scale applications like an energy smart grid system spanning entire cities, there are many challenges that need to be faced for such a system to perform effectively, namely the continuous communication and exchange of information between heterogeneous edge devices, sensors and actuators, and the division of devices in spatial clusters that need to perform special operations depending on the characteristics of the area. The aim of this paper is to provide a small-scale conceptual architecture for the communication of clusters of edge devices in a smart grid system, using the actor model and the AKKA framework as a communication backbone."

        "abstract": "The rapid digitalization of healthcare systems has led to an unprecedented accumulation of sensitive patient data across various platforms, exposing the industry to growing risks of data breaches, unauthorized access, and integrity compromise. Ensuring the security, privacy, and trustworthiness of healthcare data is paramount to maintaining patient confidentiality and enhancing clinical decision-making. This study proposes a conceptual framework that synergistically integrates Blockchain technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance healthcare data security. The framework is designed to address key challenges such as data integrity, access control, real-time threat detection, and secure interoperability across healthcare stakeholders. Blockchain, with its decentralized and immutable ledger capabilities, provides a robust foundation for tamper-proof data storage and transparent audit trails. Smart contracts are employed to automate access controls and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. AI, on the other hand, plays a critical role in intelligent threat detection and anomaly monitoring. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the framework can identify suspicious patterns, detect insider threats, and predict potential breaches in real time. The proposed architecture comprises four core components: Secure data ingestion, blockchain-based data storage, AI-powered analytics, and a privacy-preserving access management layer. The framework also incorporates role-based authentication and homomorphic encryption techniques to enhance data privacy while supporting authorized data sharing. Case scenarios such as electronic health record (EHR) exchange and remote patient monitoring are used to demonstrate the practicality and scalability of the model. This integrated approach not only ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of healthcare data but also fosters trust among patients, providers, and regulatory bodies. The framework aligns with global healthcare data standards and complies with regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR. Future directions include the deployment of federated learning models to further decentralize AI training while maintaining data privacy across institutions."

Researchers target is to find the reasons, layers, and resolving techniques of employees\u2019 frustration in the SMEs of Bangladesh. \nMethods/analysis: Qualitative content analysis with multiple case studies and focused group studies has been applied in this study following Yin and Andalib to collect and analyze data. NVIVO tool and soft systems technique has been applied to analyze collected data. \n\u00a0Findings: The study mainly observes and analyzes employees\u2019 mental state of five SMEs of Bangladesh to understand and find out the reasons\u2019 and layers of employees\u2019 frustration. Researchers have also found the resolving techniques by detailed analysis and designed a conceptual model by introducing employees\u2019 rights in the model. From previous scholars\u2019 works employees\u2019 frustration reasons, its categories, behavioral pattern of the employees\u2019 when frustrated, differences between threat and conflict have been found and discussed. From qualitative multiple case studies of five SMEs and focused group discussion among twenty employees, three major themes are identified, which are employees\u2019 need, barriers creating frustration, and layers of employees\u2019 frustration. Later, while developing the conceptual model employee rights\u2019 got introduced and resolving techniques have been added as per employees\u2019 suggestions from the focused group discussion. \nNovelty/improvement: The novelty and originality of this research lies in its methods of analyzing especially in the qualitative method, where both multiple case studies and focused group discussion have been parts since that SMEs should be brought under qualitative research more to gain more deeper understanding and insight. Moreover, Andalib mentioned in 2018 that the inclusion of component \u2018employees\u2019 rights\u2019 in the conceptual model to resolve frustration has been an importantly novel addition. \nKeywords: Conceptual Model, SME Cases, Focused Group Discussion, Layers of Frustration, Resolving Techniques."

        "abstract": "Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLT) are emerging decentralized infrastructures touted by researchers to improve existing systems that have been limited by centralized governance and proprietary control. These technologies have shown continued success in sustaining the operational models of modern cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance applications (DeFi). These applications has incentivized growing discussions in their potential applications and adoption in other sectors such as healthcare, which has a high demand for data liquidity and interoperability. Despite the increasing research efforts in adopting blockchain and DLT in healthcare with conceptual designs and prototypes, a major research gap exists in literature: there is a lack of design recommendations that discuss concrete architectural styles and domain-specific considerations that are necessary for implementing health data exchange systems based on these technologies. This paper aims to address this gap in research by introducing a collection of design patterns for constructing blockchain and DLT-based healthcare systems that support secure and scalable data sharing. Our approach adapts traditional software patterns and proposes novel patterns that take into account both the technical requirements specific to healthcare systems and the implications of these requirements on naive blockchain-based solutions."

        "abstract": "The new generation of database management systems, also known as NoSQL (Not-only-SQL) database management systems, appeared to solve the large variety of challenges raised by big data. On one hand, they offer unmatched performance advantages compared to relational database systems. On the other hand, NoSQL database management systems evolve at a very fast pace and are more challenging to understand and master, compared to relational database management systems. The fact that each NoSQL database management system has its own query language raises additional challenges for users (both experts and non-experts in computer science) in working or starting to work with them. Visual Query Systems can help in addressing this challenge by offering a more intuitive way of interacting with the database server. Based on a conceptual model which uses conceptual graphs to represent database structure and queries, we propose a Visual Query System for Apache Cassandra, the leading NoSQL database management system of the wide column stores DB-Engines ranking."

        "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has made significant development in recent years, and it is currently applied not only in simulators and games but also in embedded systems. However, when implemented in a real-world context, reinforcement learning is frequently shown to be unstable and incapable of adapting to realistic situations, particularly when directing a large number of agents. In this paper, we develop a decentralized architecture for reinforcement learning to allow multiple agents to learn optimal control policies on their own devices of the same kind but in varied environments. For such multiple agents, the traditional centralized learning algorithm usually requires a costly or time-consuming effort to develop the best-regulating policy and is incapable of scaling to a large-scale system. To address this issue, we propose a decentralized reinforcement learning algorithm (DecRL) and information exchange scheme for each individual device, in which each agent shares the individual learning experience and information with other agents based on local model training. We incorporate the algorithm into each agent in the proposed collaborative architecture and validate it in the telecommunication domain under emergency conditions, in which a macro base station (BS) is broken due to a natural disaster, and three unmanned aerial vehicles carrying BSs (UAV-BSs) are deployed to provide temporary coverage for mission-critical (MC) users in the disaster area. Based on the findings, we show that the proposed decentralized reinforcement learning algorithm can successfully support multi-agent learning, while the learning speed and service quality can be further enhanced."

In his context, the 1996 paper \u201cAnchoring data quality dimensions ontological foundations\u201d by Wand and Wang has been highly influential on the understanding of DQ. However, the present study demonstrates that some of the assumptions made in their paper can be challenged. On this basis, this study seeks to develop clearer definitions.Design/methodology/approachThe assumptions behind Wand and Wang\u2019s DQ classification are discussed, on which basis three counter-propositions are formulated. These are investigated through a representation theoretical approach involving analyses of deficient mappings between real-world and information system states. On this basis, an intrinsic DQ classification is derived. A case study is conducted to investigate the value of the developed DQ classification.FindingsThe representation theoretical analysis and the case study support the three propositions. These\u00a0give rise to the development of a DQ classification that includes three primary intrinsic DQ dimensions (accuracy, completeness and conciseness), which are associated with six primary value-level DQ deficiencies (inaccuracy, incorrectness, meaninglessness, incompleteness, absence and redundancy). The case study supports the value of extending Wand and Wang\u2019s DQ classification with the three additional data deficiencies.Research limitations/implicationsBy improving the conceptual clarity of DQ, this study provides future research with an improved basis for studies and discussions of DQ.Originality/valueThe study advances the understanding of DQ by providing additional clarity."

But the utilization of vehicular data collection and aggregation poses problem areas in the issues of privacy, security and performance. This research presents a new conceptual model to employ deep learning algorithms for privacy preservation of data aggregated in V ANETs. We adopt differential privacy for providing privacy-preserving capabilities, federated learning and the usage of the blockchain make it more scalable and secure and edge computing to retain efficiency for solving these challenges. It's about adding controlled noise in order to prevent data points from being reverse engineered, differential privacy is used. Federated learning is used to decentralize the data processing, where participation of the central location is opted out and raw data transmission is kept to the barest minimum as a means of ensuring data privacy. Blockchain technology adds another layer of more secure and reliable aggregation of data improving the overall security of transactions and the prevention of alteration or sabotage. Edge computing is incorporated to ensure the real-time response of the system hence minimizing the latency of the system besides enhancing the performance of the system. In this regard, the study demonstrates that the proposed system ideally implements all the three objectives concerning privacy, data usefulness and real-time capability. Although using differential privacy slightly affects the accuracy of a model it greatly enhances the privacy of data. Together with edge computing, federated learning avoids performance degradation in privacy-preserving computations by decentralizing computations and minimizing transmission costs. The combination of block-chains with the existing networks helps to eliminate cases of data manipulation while the minor adverse impacts towards the systems\u201d network latency are packet."

Due to the need for the improved efficiency and reliability of these processes, digitalization has become a major topic of interest in the metrology community. Data formats such as the digital calibration certificate (DCC) have an essential role as an enabler of further digitalization, acting as the harmonized data format for calibration data. Naturally, introducing these data formats into industrial usage sets new requirements with respect to the calibration management and associated systems. Diversity of metrology also means that the systems need to be flexible and scalable to fulfill the needs of actors in the global calibration infrastructure with very different requirements. This paper presents a conceptual approach for enhancing the communications between the existing systems in a calibration ecosystem and enabling DCC-based data exchange with third-party systems using the Beamex calibration ecosystem as an example. Thus, the presented system architecture concept that introduces data and DCC exchange services would provide a solution to enable the use of DCCs on Beamex systems.\n"

Its major challenges are reliability,\nand security related issues during data delivery. To mitigate these, the development of secure\nrouting protocols, which are capable of optimum utilization of WSNs\u2019 nodes resources for\neffective data delivery, has been one of the major research interests. However, most of the existing\nsingle path routing protocols for WSNs are not able to meet with up with the performance requirements\nof the mission and safety-critical systems. Meanwhile, a few that are multipath require\nhigh computational power, energy and their multiple paths are not ranked, this makes them unsuitable\nas routing protocol for WSNs in mission and safety-critical systems.\n\n\n\nIn this work, we propose a secure multipath routing protocol based on sectorisation and\nbest neighbouring nodes selection models to meet up with the performance requirements of WSNs\nin the mission and safety-critical systems. The protocol is capable of providing optimal multiple\nranked route paths for reliable data delivery.\n\n\n\nA route management technique, using direct approach, is developed for selecting different\noptimal data paths for reliable data routing. Also, simple but efficient lightweight privacy preserving\nauthentication scheme is proposed for the protocol to ensure security and privacy during\ndata routing.

        "abstract": "Exchange of information, financial transactions, and involvement of intermediaries play an important role in agriculture. However, current ICT-based agriculture systems are centralized and fail to address problems such as information asymmetry and reliability. Besides, consumers are keen to know the origin of food (traceability), intermediaries focus on transparency of shareable data and tracking of transactions are the areas to be studied in depth for smart and sustainable farming. Disruptive technology like blockchain is suitable to effectively manage smart farming. Blockchain promises reliability and authenticity of source of information as it can track the origin of a transaction. Several researchers have proposed conceptual frameworks and models. However, there is a limited study on real-time architecture that uses blockchain and decentralized applications to address the issues for smart farming. This research in progress paper presents the current gaps and focuses on incorporating blockchain to a smart and sustainable farming by developing an effective architecture. The research outcomes of the proposed study will benefit the agriculture value chains, intermediaries, farmers, and food suppliers in Australia."

        "abstract": "This paper presents a blockchain-based architecture for facilitating clinical communications within the historically underfunded rare disease community. Due to the complex nature of diagnosing and treating these conditions, patients with rare diseases are often referred to multiple care providers and specialists. Each care provider instructs patients to provide identification information to onboard them to their in-house medical record system. An effective identity management service or platform is needed to avoid repetitive steps and to identify patients in a scalable, collaborative, and sustainable way. This work proposes a decentralized, blockchain-based identity management infrastructure driven by interoperability across data management systems to accurately identify unique patients within rare disease communities and provide a supporting platform that facilitates the management and exchanges of information about identities. The proposed system identifies and represents participants with specific roles using a domain-specific digital identifier model. Once a patient's information is certified by a verifier, a Unique Digital Identifier is created for them that is linked to a persistent document holding their \u201ccyber\u201d identity. This allows the patient to identify themselves by presenting only the digital proof of their Unique Digital Identifier ownership during the subsequent medical encounters. Overall, we present a conceptual framework that allows for the fast identification of patients in the rare disease community that minimizes duplication of entries. It also enables providers and researchers to receive updates and exchange knowledge about rare diseases in an unambiguous way."

        "abstract": "Multi-UAV systems typically require complex in-frastructure to deploy in real-world scenarios, limiting their accessibility and scalability. In addition, current research often relies on custom solutions or proprietary hardware to facilitate inter-UAV communication. In this paper, we propose an open-source, low-cost, plug-and-play solution to enable decentralized UAV-to-UAV communication over 2.4GHz Wi-Fi using a con-nectionless protocol. Our approach simplifies the deployment of decentralized systems by allowing UAVs to easily exchange any type of binary data, seamlessly interfacing with ROS2. The solution uses an ad-hoc style network that allows UAVs to join or leave dynamically without requiring centralized governance or a priori configuration. We describe the architecture of the system, assess the network performance in an outdoor environment using UAVs, and evaluate the system's ability to share information as a swarm through hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) and experiments using UAVs. Our results show that the proposed system facilitates connectivity and is able to transmit mission-critical data for real-world UAV operations. HITL experiments show that a decentralized planning algorithm running on three simulated UAVs can effectively reach consensus on decentralized task allocation. We have made the code public and thus provide a viable solution for researchers seeking to implement decentralized UAV swarms using cost-effective commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and minimal infrastructure."

        "abstract": "In recent years, Blockchain arose as a key technology in building autonomous decentralised financial systems. Its ability to digitize trust enables building trustless systems such as cryptocurrencies where users do not need to rely on any third party to exchange value. The success of cryptocurrencies to operate without any intermediaries draw the interest of business operators who seek to bypass intermediation and thus to reduce cost and gain competitive advantages. As a result, Blockchain was used outside the crypto-sphere to build decentralized systems. However, this portage led to the inception of new types of Blockchains adapted to different specifications and with different designs. Consequently, the technology has diverged from its baseline (Bitcoin) to the point where some systems marketed as \u201cblockchain\u201d share only a few design concepts with the original Blockchain design proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto. This conceptual divergence alongside the lack of comprehensive models and standards made it difficult for both system designers and decision-makers to clearly understand what is a blockchain or to choose a suitable solution.This survey has a double goal; on the one hand, it attempts to contribute to the discussion on the ontological status of DLTs by providing a taxonomy oriented-framework (DCEA) for conceptualizing and examining DLT. On the other hand, it also attempts to present an up-to-date review and evaluation of current blockchains and their variants as constructed of four layers: the data, consensus, execution and application layers."

In the FIPA(Foundation of Intelligent Physical Agents) agent platform, all message transfer services among agents are in charge of a conceptual entity named ACC(Agent Communication Channel). In our multi-agent message transport architecture, the ACC is represented as a set of system agents named MTSA(Message Transfer Service Agent). The MTSA enables close collaboration among agents by supporting asynchronous communication, by using Reactor pattern to handle agent input messages efficiently, and by selecting optimal message transfer protocols according to the relative positional relationships of sender agents and receiver agents. The multi-agent framework SMAF(Small Multi-Agent Framework), which is implemented on the proposed multi-agent message transport architecture, shows better performance on message transfer among agents than JADE(Java Agent Development Environment) which is a well-known FIPA-compliant multi-agent framework. The faster the speed of message transfer of a multi-agent architecture becomes, the wider application areas the architecture can support."

        "abstract": "The diverse applications of Machine-Type Communication (MTC) lead to exponential growth in Machine to Machine traffic. In connection with MTC deployment, a large number of devices are expected to access the wireless network simultaneously, resulting in network congestion. The conventional Random Access mechanism lacks the capability to handle the large number of access attempts expected from massive MTC (mMTC). Additionally, mMTC transceivers often operate by generating short data packets in a sporadic and sometimes unpredictable manner. To address the growing need for efficient communication in massive machine-type communication scenarios we propose an innovative solution, called Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Multi-Access (DRLMA). Our model considers the Base Station (BS) as an agent navigating the landscape of machine-type communication devices. This agent dynamically switches between grant-based and grant-free access to leverage their strengths. We address the multi-access problem, formulating it as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), to better understand and tackle challenges associated with dynamic access policies. Leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques, our approach optimizes sporadic traffic patterns, crafting an adaptable access policy to maximize both network throughput and energy efficiency under the battery constraint. Simulation results show that proposed DRLMA scheme outperforms traditional access schemes and existing access protocols in sporadic traffic in terms of the energy efficiency, throughput and network life time."

INTRODUCTION It is beyond dispute that multi-agent systems are one of the most important design concepts for today\u2019s software. A multi-agent system (MAS) is a computational system that constitutes a collection of intelligent agents. An intelligent agent is a reactive, proactive, autonomous, and social entity, which performs a given task using information gleaned from its environment. In general, intelligent agents possess four major properties (Rao & Georgeff, 1992): \u2022 Reactivity \u2014 agents can perceive their environment and respond in a timely fashion to changes that occur in it; \u2022 Pro-activity \u2014 agents not only can simply act in response to their environments, but also are able to exhibit goal-directed behaviours by taking the initiative; \u2022 Autonomy \u2014 agents have some level of self-control ability, and they can operate without the direct intervention of humans; and \u2022 Social ability \u2014 agents interact with other agents. The social ability of an agent is exercised in an MAS. An MAS can be considered as a society of agents that live and work together. In such a multi-agent society, interactions between agents are unavoidable (Lesser, 1999). The interaction between agents occurs when an agent has some intentions and has decided to satisfy these through influencing other agents. Agent interactions are established through exchanging messages that specify the desired performatives of other agents and declarative representations of the contents of messages. The messages exchanged among agents are composed in agent communication languages (ACLs), such as Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML) (Finin, Labrou, & Mayfield, 1997) and the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA) ACL (FIPA, 2004). In addition, messages exchanged between agents need to follow some standard patterns, which are described in agent interaction protocols (Cranefield, Purvis, Nowostawski, & Hwang, 2002). As the application domains of MASs are getting more and more complex, many current agent interaction protocols exhibit some limitations that impede MAS implementations. Firstly, many current application domains of MASs require agents to work in changing and uncertain (open) environments. In such environments, interactions between agents may be influenced by some unexpected factors, such as unexpected messages, loss of messages, or deviation in the message order. Most current agent interaction protocols lack mechanisms to handle these unexpected factors. Secondly, agent architectures in some MASs are heterogeneous, and different agents may possess different interaction protocols. Therefore, due to the heterogeneity, when an agent initialises an interaction with others, it cannot guarantee that its interaction protocol can be understood and accepted by other agents. Thirdly, most agents are hard-coded using interaction protocols, which leads to problems. More specifically, issues such as when to use a particular protocol, what information to transmit, what order to execute tasks, and so on, are left to agent designers. This feature reduces the flexibility of the agent interactions because protocols are hard to modify at runtime once they are pre-coded into the agents. Finally, many current interaction protocols, such as KQML, are not specifically designed to carry knowledge. This kind of knowledge \u201cpoor\u201d (Lesser, 1998) protocol is not suitable for applications that need 14 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the \"Add to Cart\" button on the publisher's webpage: www.igi-global.com/chapter/coordinating-agent-interactionsunder-open/4673"

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a coherent framework for multi-machine analysis, using a group clustering model, which can be utilized for predictive maintenance (PdM). The framework benefits from the repetitive structure posed by multiple machines and enables for assessment of health condition, degradation modeling and comparison of machines. It is based on a hierarchical probabilistic model, denoted Gaussian topic model (GTM), where cluster patterns are shared over machines and therefore it allows one to directly obtain proportions of patterns over the machines. This is then used as a basis for cross comparison between machines where identified similarities and differences can lead to important insights about their degradation behaviors. The framework is based on aggregation of data over multiple streams by a predefined set of features extracted over a time window. Moreover, the framework contains a clustering schema which takes uncertainty of cluster assignments into account and where one can specify a desirable degree of reliability of the assignments. By using a multi-machine simulation example, we highlight how the framework can be utilized in order to obtain cluster patterns and inherent variations of such patterns over machines. Furthermore, a comparative study with the commonly used Gaussian mixture model (GMM) demonstrates that GTM is able to identify inherent patterns in the data while the GMM fails. Such result is a consequence of the group level being modeled by the GTM while being absent in the GMM. Hence, the GTM are trained with a view on the data that is not available to the GMM with the consequence that the GMM can miss important, possibly even key cluster patterns. Therefore, we argue that more advanced cluster models, like the GTM, can be key for interpreting and understanding degradation behavior across machines and ultimately for obtaining more efficient and reliable PdM systems."

        "abstract": "Data on the impact of long term treatment with immunomodulatory drugs (IMiD) on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is limited. The HOVON-87/NMSG18 study was a randomized, phase 3 study in newly diagnosed transplant ineligible patients with multiple myeloma, comparing melphalan-prednisolone in combination with thalidomide or lenalidomide, followed by maintenance therapy until progression (MPT-T or MPR-R). The EORTC QLQ-C30 and MY20 questionnaires were completed at baseline, after three and nine induction cycles and six and 12 months of maintenance therapy. Linear mixed models and minimal important differences were used for evaluation. 596 patients participated in HRQoL reporting. Patients reported clinically relevant improvement in global quality of life (QoL), future perspective and role and emotional functioning, and less fatigue and pain in both arms. The latter being of large effect size. In general, improvement occurred after 6\u201312 months of maintenance only and was independent of the World Health Organisation performance at baseline. Patients treated with MPR-R reported clinically relevant worsening of diarrhea, and patients treated with MPT-T reported a higher incidence of neuropathy. Patients who remained on lenalidomide maintenance therapy for at least three months reported clinically meaningful improvement in global QoL and role functioning at six months, remaining stable thereafter. There were no clinically meaningful deteriorations, but patients on thalidomide reported clinically relevant worsening in neuropathy. In general, HRQoL improves both during induction and maintenance therapy with immunomodulatory drugs. The side effect profile of treatment did not negatively affect global QoL, but it was, however, clinically relevant for the patients. (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NTR1630)."

We combine cognitive and genetic data from the CHARGE and COGENT consortia, and UK Biobank (total N\u2009=\u2009300,486; age 16\u2013102) and find 148 genome-wide significant independent loci (P\u2009<\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22128) associated with general cognitive function. Within the novel genetic loci are variants associated with neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, physical and psychiatric illnesses, and brain structure. Gene-based analyses find 709 genes associated with general cognitive function. Expression levels across the cortex are associated with general cognitive function. Using polygenic scores, up to 4.3% of variance in general cognitive function is predicted in independent samples. We detect significant genetic overlap between general cognitive function, reaction time, and many health variables including eyesight, hypertension, and longevity. In conclusion we identify novel genetic loci and pathways contributing to the heritability of general cognitive function. Cognitive function is associated with health and important life outcomes. Here, the authors perform a genome-wide association study for general cognitive function in 300,486 individuals and identify genetic loci that implicate neural and cell developmental pathways in this trait."

We prospectively compared intensification with transplantation versus bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone (VMP), and bortezomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (VRD) consolidation versus no consolidation. \n \nMethods: In this randomized, open-label, phase 3 study we recruited previously untreated myeloma patients aged up to 65 years at 172 sites of the European Myeloma Network. Patients were first randomized (1:1) to VMP (4 cycles) or transplantation, and afterwards to VRD consolidation (2 cycles) or no consolidation, followed by lenalidomide-maintenance. Progression-free survival from first and second randomization were primary endpoints. Comparison of single versus double transplantation was a secondary endpoint. \n \nFindings: Between February, 2011 and April, 2014, 1503 patients were enrolled. Overall, 1197 patients were eligible for the first randomization: 702 received transplantation and 495 VMP; 877 patients underwent the second randomization: 449 received VRD consolidation and 428 no consolidation. Progression-free survival from first randomization was significantly better with transplantation than with VMP (median, 56\u00b77 versus 41\u00b79 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b773, 95% CI 0\u00b762-0\u00b785, p=0\u00b70001). VRD consolidation prolonged median progression-free survival from second randomization compared with no consolidation (58\u00b79 versus 45.5 months; HR 0\u00b777, 95% CI 0\u00b763-0\u00b795, p=0\u00b7014). Overall survival estimates at 5 years were 75% with transplantation and 71\u00b76% with VMP (HR 0\u00b790, 95% CI 0\u00b771-1.13, p=0\u00b735). Double transplantation significantly prolonged progression-free survival (HR 0\u00b774, 95% CI 0\u00b756-0\u00b798, p=0\u00b7036) and overall survival (HR 0\u00b762, 95% CI 0\u00b741-0\u00b793, p=0\u00b7022) compared to a single transplantation. The rate of at least one grade \u22653 adverse event was 88% with transplantation versus 52% with VMP. Transplant-related mortality was 1%. \n \nInterpretation: In newly diagnosed myeloma patients, intensification therapy with transplantation significantly prolonged progression-free survival compared with VMP, although overall survival was similar. After intensification, VRD consolidation significantly improved progression-free survival compared with no consolidation. \n \nTrial Registration: This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01208766. \n \nFunding Statement: The Dutch-Belgian Cooperative Trial Group for Hematology Oncology (HOVON) sponsored and designed this study.

        "abstract": "We assessed the predictive capacity of the HCV-MOSAIC risk score, originally developed for primary early HCV infection, as a screening tool for HCV reinfection in 103 men who have sex with men (MSM) with HIV using data from the MOSAIC cohort, including MSM with HIV/HCV-coinfection who became reinfected (cases, n = 27) or not (controls, n = 76) during follow-up. The overall predictive capacity of the score was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. The effects of covariates on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were assessed using parametric ROC regression. The score cut-off validated for primary early infection (\u22652.0) was used, from which the sensitivity and specificity were calculated. The AUROC was 0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.63\u20130.84). Group sex significantly increased the predictive capacity. Using the validated cut-off, sensitivity was 70.4% (95%CI = 49.8\u201386.2%) and specificity was 59.2% (95%CI: 47.3\u201370.4%). External validation from a cohort of 25 cases and 111 controls, all MSM with HIV, resulted in a sensitivity of 44.0% (95%CI = 24.4\u201365.1) and specificity of 71.2% (95%CI = 61.8\u201379.4). The HCV-MOSAIC risk score may be useful for identifying individuals at risk of HCV reinfection. In sexual health or HIV-care settings, this score could help guide HCV-RNA testing in MSM with a prior HCV infection."

        "abstract": "Many railway assets suffer increasing wear and tear during operation. Prognostics can assist diagnosis by assessing the current health of a system and predicting its remaining life based on features that capture the gradual degradation in a system\u2019s operational capabilities. Prognostics are critical to improve safety, plan successful work, schedule maintenance, and reduce maintenance costs and down time. Unlike fault diagnosis, prognosis is a relatively new area, but it has become an important part of Condition-based Maintenance (CBM) of systems. As there are many prognostic techniques, usage must be attuned to particular applications. Broadly stated, prognostic methods are either data-driven or model-based. Each has advantages and disadvantages; consequently, they are often combined in hybrid applications. A approach hybrid model can combine some or all model types (data-driven, and phenomenological); thus, more complete information can be gathered, leading to more accurate recognition of the fault state. This approach is especially relevant in railway systems where the maintainer and operator know some of the failure mechanisms, but the complexity of the infrastructure and rolling stock is huge that there is no way to develop a complete model-based approach. Therefore, hybrid models are extremely useful for accurately estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of railway systems. The paper addresses the process of data aggregation into a hybrid model to get RUL values within logical confidence intervals so that the life cycle of railway assets can be managed and optimised."

        "abstract": "The Hamburg City Health Study\u00a0(HCHS) is a large, prospective, long-term, population-based cohort study and a unique research platform and network to obtain substantial knowledge about several important risk and prognostic factors in major chronic diseases. A random sample of 45,000 participants between 45 and 74\u00a0years of age from the general population of Hamburg, Germany, are taking part in an extensive baseline assessment at one dedicated study center. Participants undergo 13 validated and 5 novel examinations primarily targeting major organ system function and structures including extensive imaging examinations. The protocol includes validate self-reports via questionnaires regarding lifestyle and environmental conditions, dietary habits, physical condition and activity, sexual dysfunction, professional life, psychosocial context and burden, quality of life, digital media use, occupational, medical and family history as well as healthcare utilization. The assessment is completed by genomic and proteomic characterization. Beyond the identification of classical risk factors for major chronic diseases and survivorship, the core intention is to gather valid prevalence and incidence, and to develop complex models predicting health outcomes based on a multitude of examination data, imaging, biomarker, psychosocial and behavioral assessments. Participants at risk for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, stroke and dementia are invited for a visit to conduct an additional MRI examination of either heart or brain. Endpoint assessment of the overall sample will be completed through repeated follow-up examinations and surveys as well as related individual routine data from involved health and pension insurances. The study is targeting the complex relationship between biologic and psychosocial risk and resilience factors, chronic disease, health care use, survivorship and health as well as favorable and bad prognosis within a unique, large-scale long-term assessment with the perspective of further examinations after 6\u00a0years in a representative European metropolitan population."

The substantial heritability of general cognitive function is known to be polygenic, but it has had little explication in terms of the contributing genetic variants4,5,6. Here, we combined cognitive and genetic data from the CHARGE and COGENT consortia, and UK Biobank (total N=280,360). We found 9,714 genome-wide significant SNPs (P<5 \u00d7 10\u22128) in 99 independent loci. Most showed clear evidence of functional importance. Among many novel genes associated with general cognitive function were SGCZ, ATXN1, MAPT, AUTS2, and P2RY6. Within the novel genetic loci were variants associated with neurodegenerative disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, physical and psychiatric illnesses, brain structure, and BMI. Gene-based analyses found 536 genes significantly associated with general cognitive function; many were highly expressed in the brain, and associated with neurogenesis and dendrite gene sets. Genetic association results predicted up to 4% of general cognitive function variance in independent samples. There was significant genetic overlap between general cognitive function and information processing speed, as well as many health variables including longevity."

        "abstract": "\n \n EKM, AM and MD contributed equally to this work.\n BACKGROUND. Despite major advances in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) in the past two decades, outcomes remain heterogenous, with some patients being primary refractory and others being long-term non-progressors. There is still an unmet need to identify patients at risk for early relapse/progression (ER) upfront to tailor new treatment strategies and improve outcomes in this population.\n METHODS. This analysis included data from 10843 patients with newly diagnosed (ND)MM treated in 16 international, multicenter clinical trials from 2005 to 2016. Data were collected by the European Myeloma Network (EMN) within the HARMONY Platform (www.harmony-alliance.eu) supported by the European Hematology Association (EHA).\n The primary endpoint was a landmark analysis of overall survival (OS) starting from 18 months after randomization in patients with and without ER within 18 months from MM diagnosis (ER<18). ER<18 as an independent factor and baseline factors associated with ER<18 were analyzed in multivariable models. An additive scoring system to predict ER<18 was developed based on a clinical and statistical selection of MM disease parameters. High-risk cytogenetic abnormalities (HRCA) were defined as either del(17p), t(4;14), t(14;16) or +1q21. Patients who were censored (n=442) or died without progressive disease within the first 18 months (n=661) were excluded from the analyses.\n RESULTS. A total of 9740 patients were available for the landmark analyses at 18 months from MM diagnosis (median follow-up: 72 months, IQR 58-87), 1970 of whom had an ER<18 (1254 deaths), 7051 had no ER<18 (2392 deaths) and 719 had died with progressive disease within the first 18 months. OS at 18 months from MM diagnosis was significantly shorter in patients with ER<18 vs those without ER<18 (median OS: 48 [95% CI 46-51] vs 115 months [95% CI 109-122], HR 3.32, 95% CI 3.10-3.56, p<0.0001). In a multivariable model including 2768 complete patient cases, ER<18 was an independent prognostic factor (HR 2.79, 95% CI 2.60-3.00, p<0.0001), along with established prognostic factors such as International Staging System (ISS) stage III (vs I: HR 1.83, 95% CI 1.65-2.02, p<0.0001), HRCA (vs standard risk: HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.58-1.99, p<0.0001) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; yes vs no: HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.20-1.43, p<0.0001).\n ER<18 was significantly associated with single-hit HRCA (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.27-1.83, p<0.0001) and double-hit HRCA (OR 2.87, 95% CI 2.24-3.68, p<0.0001). Other factors associated with ER<18 were ISS stages II and III (II: OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.35-1.72, p<0.0001; III: OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.79-2.37, p<0.0001) and elevated LDH (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.21-1.56, p<0.0001). Treatment with a proteasome inhibitor plus an immunomodulatory agent vs only one of the two drug classes significantly reduced the risk of ER<18 (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.42-0.53, p<0.0001). The dissection of HRCA in a similar multivariable model revealed that double-hit HRCA involving del(17p) had the overall strongest association with ER<18 (OR 3.32, 95% CI 2.29-4.81, p<0.0001), followed by single-hit del(17p) (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.59-3.17, p<0.0001).\n An additive scoring system for ER<18 identified single-hit HRCA (1 point), double-hit HRCA (2), ISS II (1), ISS III (2) and elevated LDH (1) as significant MM disease-specific parameters. Patients with low (0-1 points, 47% of patients), intermediate (2-3, 44%) and high (4-5, 9%) counts had gradually increasing and statistically significant different risks for ER<18 of respectively 18% (reference), 33% (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.92-2.78, p<0.0001) and 49% (OR 4.51, 95% CI 3.37-6.04, p<0.0001). Among patients with ER<18, the three risk categories retained their prognostic impact, with a median OS at 18 months from MM diagnosis of 68 (95% CI 56-89), 41 (95% CI 37-46) and 29 months (95% CI 25-34) in the low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups, suggesting OS heterogeneity even among functional high-risk MM patients.\n CONCLUSIONS. Our unique, large dataset of NDMM patients confirmed the unmet need for patients with ER<18 and brought to light the adverse prognostic impact of del(17p) as single- or double-hit HRCA. Although it did not account for all patients with ER<18, the accumulation of established MM-specific risk factors was associated with an increasing risk for ER<18, and MM-specific risk factors retained their prognostic significance among functional high-risk patients.\n"

        "abstract": "Background: Several population-based studies on multiple myeloma (MM) have shown an improvement in relative survival (RS) for patients aged 65 years or younger at the time of diagnosis. In patients aged 75 years or older, the improvement in long-term RS is absent in most reports or much less pronounced. To our knowledge, only 2 studies based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database have demonstrated a significant increase in RS for this age-group. (Pulte et al. 2011, Costa et al. 2017) We performed a population-based study on Norwegian MM-patients to provide up-to-date estimates on changes in relative survival during the past 3 decades.\n Methods: The Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN) was established in 1951 and provides high-quality nationwide cancer statistics. For MM, the reported completeness of case-ascertainment is above 95%. Incidence data and all reported cases of MM diagnosed between January 1, 1982 and December 31, 2017 were retrieved from the CRN (n=10 961). Nationwide drug consumption statistics for drugs used in myeloma treatment were retrieved from the Norwegian Drug Wholesales Statistics and the Norwegian Prescriptions Database, Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Follow-up ended December 31, 2017. The time of MM-diagnosis was divided into 7 categories: 1982-1987, 1988-1992 (melphalan-prednisone), 1993-1997(early high-dose melphalan with autologous stem-cell transplant (HDM-ASCT)), 1998-2002 (introduction of thalidomide), 2003-2007 (early thalidomide upfront, introduction of bortezomib), 2008-2012 (thalidomide and bortezomib upfront, introduction of lenalidomide), 2013-2017 (lenalidomide upfront, early pomalidomide, daratumumab, panobinostat and carfilzomib). Age at diagnosis was divided into 3 categories; <65 years, 65-79 years and 80 years or older. We estimated relative survival ratios (RSR) with 95% confidence intervals 5 and 10 years after the time of diagnosis by the Ederer-II method. The analysis was stratified by age-group and calendar period of diagnosis. Cohort analysis was applied to calendar periods with complete follow-up, and period analysis was applied where complete-follow up was not available (2013-2017 and 10-year estimates for 2008-2012). Non-overlapping confidence intervals were considered statistically significant.\n Results: The age-standardized incidence rate was stable until approximately year 2000, followed by an increasing tendency reaching 8.4 cases per 100 000 persons in 2017. Figure 1. Patients diagnosed before the age of 65 had a steady increase in both 5 and 10-year RSR across all calendar periods. For patients aged 65-79 years, the 5- and 10-year RSR's were stable at approximately 0.3 and 0.1, respectively, until the calendar period 1998-2002. In the following years, an improvement in both 5- and 10-year RSR was observed. The 5-year RSR improved significantly from 0.31 (95% CI; 0.27-0.35) in the first calendar period to 0.43 (95% CI;0.39- 0.47) during 2008-2012. The predicted 5-year RSR for 2013-2017 was 0.48 (95% CI; 0.44-0.52). There were also signs of improved 10-year RSR, predicted to 0.23 (95% CI; 0.18-0.27) during 2013-2017 compared to 0.11 (95% CI; 0.08-0.14) during 1982-1987. The 5-year RSR for patients aged 80+ years was 0.11 (95% CI; 0.01-0.17) during 1982-1987 and the 10-year RSR was 0.03 (95% CI; 0.01-0.11). In the following 4 calendar periods the RSR-estimates fluctuated before a rising tendency during the last 2 periods. The 5-year RSR improved significantly to 0.26 (95% CI; 0.20-0.32) during 2008-2012 and further rising to a predicted value of 0.32 (95% CI; 0.25-0.38) during 2013-2017. Figure 2. Additionally, complete annual prescription statistics for the oral agents thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide were obtained.\n Conclusions: We provide real-world observations on changes in RS in a population-based cohort of 10 961 MM-patients. We demonstrate an improvement in 5-year relative survival across all age-groups, including patients aged 80 years or older. For patients <65 years, there was a steady increase in RS since 1982 and we see no obvious impact of the implementation of HDM-ASCT. For the other age-groups, the improvement in RS coincides with the introduction of new drugs. The increase in incidence since 2000 may be due to increased testing for M-protein. We can point to the introduction of new drugs and increased incidence of indolent cases as possible reasons for increasing RS.\n \n \n \n No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.\n"

        "abstract": "Background: Healthcare-associated infection (HAI) surveillance is essential for most infection prevention programs and continuous epidemiological data can be used to inform healthcare personal, allocate resources, and evaluate interventions to prevent HAIs. Many HAI surveillance systems today are based on time-consuming and resource-intensive manual reviews of patient records. The objective of HAI-proactive, a Swedish triple-helix innovation project, is to develop and implement a fully automated HAI surveillance system based on electronic health record data. Furthermore, the project aims to develop machine-learning\u2013based screening algorithms for early prediction of HAI at the individual patient level. Methods: The project is performed with support from Sweden\u2019s Innovation Agency in collaboration among academic, health, and industry partners. Development of rule-based and machine-learning algorithms is performed within a research database, which consists of all electronic health record data from patients admitted to the Karolinska University Hospital. Natural language processing is used for processing free-text medical notes. To validate algorithm performance, manual annotation was performed based on international HAI definitions from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Sepsis-3 criteria. Currently, the project is building a platform for real-time data access to implement the algorithms within Region Stockholm. Results: The project has developed a rule-based surveillance algorithm for sepsis that continuously monitors patients admitted to the hospital, with a sensitivity of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85\u20130.93), a specificity of 0.99 (0.98\u20130.99), a positive predictive value of 0.88 (0.83\u20130.93), and a negative predictive value of 0.99 (0.98\u20130.99). The healthcare-associated urinary tract infection surveillance algorithm, which is based on free-text analysis and negations to define symptoms, had a sensitivity of 0.73 (0.66\u20130.80) and a positive predictive value of 0.68 (0.61\u20130.75). The sensitivity and positive predictive value of an algorithm based on significant bacterial growth in urine culture only was 0.99 (0.97\u20131.00) and 0.39 (0.34\u20130.44), respectively. The surveillance system detected differences in incidences between hospital wards and over time. Development of surveillance algorithms for pneumonia, catheter-related infections and Clostridioides difficile infections, as well as machine-learning\u2013based models for early prediction, is ongoing. We intend to present results from all algorithms. Conclusions: With access to electronic health record data, we have shown that it is feasible to develop a fully automated HAI surveillance system based on algorithms using both structured data and free text for the main healthcare-associated infections.

        "abstract": "The pharmaceutical industry is an important contributor to the health of the UK economy, with 65 000 people directly employed and many more in support industries [1]. It delivered a net trade surplus of \u00a32.6 billion to the UK economy in 2002 and was rated as the highest value-adding industry, with \u00a378 000 of value added to the economy per industry employee in the same period. It is a highly competitive global industry with significant high-risk, long-term investment in increasingly costly drug discovery and development activity. It takes ~10\u201312 years to bring a new medicine to market and the average development cost is \u00a3350 million, with high attrition rates. The rewards are high for successful transnational players, with pre-tax profits of 30% on sales [2]. The industry presents particular challenges to occupational health practitioners engaged in the delivery of effective occupational health services. The demands of a highly technical work environment must be blended with the need to maintain effective health management in a fast-paced, changing and pressured global business climate. This, combined with a high level of focus on innovation and productivity through human capital development strategies, provides a rich mix of factors to take into account when selecting and implementing health interventions that are appropriate, risk-targeted, cost-effective and acceptable to employees and management. An overview of health hazards in the industry published in 1947 provides a familiar list of headings and exposure issues to today\u2019s pharmaceutical occupational health practitioner. The contemporary collection of reviews in this issue of Occupational Medicine provides an update: so, has anything changed beyond the product names that populate the lists of recognized causes of exposure-related health effects? [3] Providing rational, risk-based advice on the prediction, prevention and management of exposure-related health effects from a diverse and novel range of workplace health hazards requires increasingly specialized technical competences and industry knowledge. Binks reviews occupational toxicology and the control of exposure to pharmaceutical agents at work [4]. He provides insight into the high level of resource investment and multidisciplinary expertise applied to predicting the potential adverse effects of occupational exposure. The industry has pioneered occupational hazard categorization systems and led the way in developing novel approaches to the containment of highly potent biologically active substances. Heron and Pickering review the published evidence for health effects related to exposure to active pharmaceutical ingredients [5]. The literature continues to be dominated by well-known historical clusters of occupational illness burden associated with particular classes of drug compounds and there is a paucity of recently published data. Is this a cause for optimism that the battle has been won? Laboratory animal allergy (LAA) remains an important and potentially life-threatening cause of occupational sensitization, often with significant career implications for those affected. Gordon and Preece [6] present a summary of the state of the art in preventing this condition. They offer encouragement that investment in a policy-driven integrated approach to allergen exposure control can result in a reduction in incidence. The lower level of importance of occupational health interventions, such as health surveillance, compared to other components of LAA risk management systems is noted. However, occupational health practitioners remain well placed to play a key role in facilitating and co-ordinating the Director, Southern Client Services, Aon Health Solutions, 2 Circus Place, London EC2M 5RS, UK.

        "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is often over expressed in ovarian cancer (OVCA), promoting ascites and effusions. Preclinical studies of inhibition of VEGF and its receptors (VEGFR) show activity in OVCA xenografts. Clinical interest in evaluating VEGF (R) inhibition was triggered when the Gynecologic Oncology Group demonstrated single agent activity of the VEGF targeted antibody, bevacizumab (BEV) in recurrent OVCA. Since that time, BEV and small molecular VEGFR inhibitors have been studied in numerous phase II and III trials in OVCA. Randomized BEV trials are the most mature with results reported in first line (GOG218, ICON7), platinum sensitive recurrent disease (OCEANS trial) and platinum resistant recurrent disease (AURELIA trial) settings. All trials gave concurrent chemotherapy + BEV with some providing maintenance BEV after chemotherapy. All have shown a biological effect of the addition of BEV with higher response rates and longer progression free survival (PFS) in BEV arms. To date, no trial has shown overall survival (OS) improvement, although mature analyses for OS are awaited. Quality of life data have not suggested a benefit with BEV and toxicity is greater. Results of phase III trials of VEGFR inhibitors cedarinib, pazopanib and nintedanib are awaited. The BEV results lead to several important questions: 1) in the absence of significant OS improvement to date, is there sufficient patient benefit from PFS increases to warrant incorporation of BEV into ovarian cancer treatment? And when over the course of the disease should the agent be given? 2) Is the use of BEV cost effective and affordable? 3) Which patient subset is benefiting most? Subgroup analysis of the ICON7 study, suggests that patients with greater bulk disease (Stage III> 1 cm residual and Stage IV) seem to derive more PFS benefit. Indeed in this subgroup, overall survival also was improved. However, in the GOG0218 trial, the hazard ratio for PFS was observed to be better in patients with < 1 cm residual. Some have suggested VEGF A plasma levels may be predictive of BEV benefit, but no results from the BEV OVCA trials are yet published. In summary, clinical results to date show significant PFS improvements from BEV in 4 trials, but it is unclear if this will translate into improved OS and how best and in whom BEV should be used in OVCA management.

Purpose Haptoglobin (Hp) is an innate antioxidant and scavenges haemoglobin. In humans, Hp is present in three major genotypes: Hp 1-1, 2-1, and 2-2. The antioxidant ability of Hp is genotype-dependent. Hp 2-2 has previously been associated with a progressive decline in renal function and enhanced risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. In renal transplant recipients no previous data exist regarding the infl uence of Hp genotype. The aim of this study was to examine the relation between Hp genotype, graft loss, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in renal transplant recipients. Methods In a cohort of 1989 Norwegian renal transplant recipients Hp genotype was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. Follow-up data on graft loss, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality were registered in a validated database (Norwegian renal registry). Data were analyzed using a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. Results Median follow-up was 5.1 years with 432 (21.7%) events. When divided in three groups according to Hp genotype no difference was seen between groups regarding graft-loss, cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. In a multivariate analysis, adjustment for the following variables: age, gender, estimated glomerular fi ltration rate, body mass index, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, time on dialysis, transplant number, donor age, living donor, HLA-DR mismatches, cholesterol and number of anti-hypertensives, did not alter the results. Multivariate analysis for graft loss or death: Hp 2-2 (ref), Hp 2-1 (HR 1.13 (0.92-1.39), p 0.25) and Hp1-1 (HR 0.97 (0.71-1.3), p 0.82). Conclusion In a large cohort of renal transplant recipients with long-term follow-up, Hp genotype did not infl uence graft loss, cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. Abstract# C1775 Endothelial Progenitor Cells in Kidney Transplant Patients. F. Damiano,1 G. Ligabue,1 S. De Biasi,2 M. Granito,1 A. Cossarizza,2 G. Cappelli.1 1Dept of Surgery, Medicine, Dentistry and Morphological Scienses, University Hospital of Modena, Nephrology Unit, Modena, Italy; 2Dept of Surgery, Medicine, Dentistry and Morphological Scienses, University of Modena & Reggio Emilia,, Modena, Italy. Background: Circulating bone-marrow derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) promote vascular repair. Lower concentrations of EPCs correlate with cardiovascular risk. In uremic patients, the number of functionally active EPCs is reduced. Kidney transplantation (KTx) improves both survival and endothelial function in patients with advanced renal failure. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of KTx and immunosuppressive therapy on the number of EPCs. Methods: EPCs were measured by fl ow cytometry analysis in 51 renal transplant patients (52\u00b113,92 years; mean eGFR 52,61\u00b119,90 ml/min) and 25 healthy subjects (49\u00b115 years; mean eGFR 94\u00b123 ml/min). We examined the associations between counts of EPCs and traditional cardiovascular risk factors, uremia related risk factors, kidney function and immunosuppressive agents. Results: EPCs numbers were similar in Kidney transplant recipients and controls. We found signifi cant (p<0.05) independent inverse associations between counts of EPCs and age, sistolic and diastolic blood pressure and C-Reactive Protein (CRP). Renal transplant recipients with reduced graft function (mean eGFR <30 ml/min) had lower EPCs counts compared with healthy volunteers(1,05-05 \u00b1 1,17-05 vs.3,9504 \u00b1 8,35-04 as % on 5x106 PBMc; p=0,0105). Patients receiving regimen therapy including corticosteroids showed signifi cantly lower EPCs number (1,77-02\u00b1 1,24-02 vs.6,74-04 \u00b1 9,77-04 as % on 5x106 PBMc; p<0,0001). The use of Cyclosporine and Everolimus induced a further decrease in EPCs number compared to Cyclosporine and Mycophenolate (7,70-05 \u00b1 1,65-04 vs.6,74-04 \u00b1 9,77-04 as % on 5x106 PBMc; p=0,0044). Conclusions: EPCs numbers in KTx are comparable to those found in healthy subjects. In addition, this study suggests negative associations in KTx between EPC counts and age, blood pressure, CRP, graft function and use of some immunosuppressive drugs combination. These fi ndings indicate an improved potential for endothelial repair after KTx, suggest a different effect from different anti-rejection drugs and emphasize the role of EPCs as marker of endothelial health and predictors of cardiovascular outcomes.

Abstract# C1776 Osteoporosis and Fractures After Solid Organ Transplantation: A Nationwide Population-Based Case-Control Study. T. Yu,1,2 C. Kao.2 1Internal Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan; 2Clinical Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan. Objectives: Metabolic bone disease after solid organ transplantation (SOT) is becoming an important complication to consider in chronic transplant patients. However, few population studies have described long-term outcomes of osteoporosis and related fractures after SOT. Therefore, we devoted to investigate the prevalence of bone disorders after SOT and to compare the risk of different SOT in a nationwide population-based study. Methods: We used Taiwan\u2019s National Health Insurance Research Database to identify 9,535 solid organ transplant recipients and 38,140 gender and age matched-control subjects to compare the incidence and risk of bone disorders in both groups. Results: Patients with SOT had a signifi cantly higher incidence rate of osteoporosis and related fractures as compared to the non-SOT group. The overall hazard ratio of osteoporosis after transplantation for SOT patients was 5.36 (95% CI= 3.298.72) as well as HR of related fractures was 6.07(95% CI =4.039.16) after adjustment. The highest sexand age-specifi c HR were observed in the male patients (HR=7.79, 95% CI=3.46-17.5) and those with an age \u226450 years (HR=7.46, 95% CI=2.50-22.3). In addition, SOT patients without any comorbidity had an 8.96-fold higher risk of developing osteoporosis than non-SOT subjects (HR=8.96, 95% CI=5.25-15.3). To compare the risk of osteoporosis and related fractures among different SOT patients, the highest risk of osteoporosis as well as fractures was noted among patients receiving lung transplantation followed by other types of SOT. Conclusion: In the study, we report unacceptably high rates of metabolic bone disorders after SOT in chronic transplant patients over a long follow-up period. Pre-transplant bone disorders and immunosuppressant agents are supposed to be involved with metabolic disorders after transplantation.

        "abstract": "This paper introduces an innovative framework that enhances digital twins with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to support maintenance in manufacturing systems. Utilizing a sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) layer, this framework integrates real-time and historical production data from a physical manufacturing system to a digital twin, enabling dynamic simulation and analysis. Maintenance decisions are informed by DRL algorithms that analyze this data, facilitating smart maintenance strategies that adaptively prioritize tasks based on predictive analytics. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through a case study in a lab-scale drone factory, where maintenance tasks are prioritized using a proximal policy optimization. This integration not only refines maintenance decisions but also aligns with the broader goals of operational efficiency and sustainability in Industry 4.0. Our results highlight the potential of combining DRL with digital twins to significantly enhance decision-making in industrial maintenance, offering a novel approach to predictive and prescriptive maintenance practices."

        "abstract": "Because of the global need to increase power production from renewable energy resources, developments in the online monitoring of the associated infrastructure is of interest to reduce operation and maintenance costs. However, challenges exist for data-driven approaches to this problem, such as incomplete or limited histories of labelled damage-state data, operational and environmental variability, or the desire for the quantification of uncertainty to support risk management. This work first introduces a probabilistic regression model for predicting wind-turbine power, which adjusts for wake effects learnt from data. Spatial correlations in the learned model parameters for different tasks (turbines) are then leveraged in a hierarchical Bayesian model (an approach to multi-task learning) to develop a\"metamodel\", which can be used to make power-predictions which adjust for turbine location - including on previously unobserved turbines not included in the training data. The results show that the metamodel is able to outperform a series of benchmark models, and demonstrates a novel strategy for making efficient use of data for inference in populations of structures, in particular where correlations exist in the variable(s) of interest (such as those from wind-turbine wake-effects)."

Infrastructure and hardware are in place at Nellis AFB for CAMS to be used via a mobile device on the flightline. The mobile system at Nellis AFE is referred to as the Nellis AFE CAMS at the Flightline system. This document describes a usability test conducted by the Air Force Research Laboratory and the University of Dayton Research Institute at Nellis AFB: The test assessed the Nellis AFB CAMS at the Flightline system accessing CAMS via two different modes. These modes of maintenance documentation were: 1) a portable laptop accessing CAMS via wireless frequency and 2) the desktop device accessing CAMS via wired network. The conditions tested included: 1) opening work orders, 2) listing open work orders, and 3) closing work orders in both the stationary CAMS condition and in the mobile CAMS condition. This study focused on the differences and similarities between the stationary CAMS and mobile CAMS access methods, as well as the usability of each. Significant time savings are realized by use of the mobile system when required travel time is included as part of the overall task; however, when time required for the additional logon required in the mobile condition is included in the analysis, no significant time savings are observed for the mobile system as compared to the stationary method. The additional sign-on time is identified as the key factor precluding significant time savings when using the mobile system."

Here, we review the role of computational modeling in helping to unlock this complexity, allowing the dissection of intricate feedback dynamics. We focus on three forms of epigenetic memory encoded in gene regulatory networks, DNA methylation, and histone modifications and discuss the important advantages offered by plant systems in their dissection. We summarize the main modeling approaches involved and highlight the principal conceptual advances that the modeling has enabled through iterative cycles of predictive modeling and experiments. Lastly, we discuss remaining gaps in our understanding and how intertwined theory and experimental approaches might help in their resolution.

In a nested patient-control study, we measured serial carbamylated albumin concentrations in select participants from a large incident dialysis cohort followed from 2004 to 2005 (n=10,044); 122 individuals who survived at least 90 days but died within 1 year of initiating hemodialysis (patients) were randomly selected along with 244 individuals who survived for at least 1 year (controls; matched for demographics). Carbamylated albumin concentration was measured using plasma collected at dialysis initiation and every subsequent 90-day period until 1 year or death.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBaseline carbamylated albumin concentration was similar between controls and patients (mean\u00b1SD; 18.9\u00b10.7 and 19.8\u00b11.1 mmol/mol, respectively; P=0.94). From dialysis initiation to day 90, carbamylated albumin concentration markedly fell in all patients, with controls -9.9\u00b10.8 mmol/mol (P<0.001) and patients -10.0\u00b11.2 mmol/mol (P<0.001). Adjusted repeated measures analysis of carbamylated albumin concentration from dialysis initiation to 1 year or death showed that the mean change (95% confidence interval) in carbamylated albumin concentration from baseline to final measure differed significantly between groups (-9.3; 95% confidence interval, -10.8 to -7.7 for controls and -6.3; 95% confidence interval, -7.7 to -2.8 for patients; P<0.01). There were no such between-group differences in blood urea levels, Kt/V, or normalized protein catabolic rate. Mortality prediction assessed using c statistics showed that carbamylated albumin concentration, when modeled continuously as the difference from baseline to final, improved a fully adjusted model from 0.76 to 0.87 (P=0.03).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nProtein carbamylation decreased with dialysis initiation, and a greater reduction over time was associated with a lower risk for mortality. Carbamylation changes were able to predict individuals' mortality risk beyond traditional variables, including markers of dialysis adequacy and nutrition."

However, misalignment between configurator objectives and development processes poses threats to the success of configurator projects. To address such problems, this research presents a coordinated approach to improve configurator development and reduce the likelihood of project failure, through the use of coordinated performance assessment.Design/methodology/approachThe suggested approach was developed by organizing existing configurator performance measurement methods, which were identified through a literature review. A longitudinal, action research\u2013based case study was conducted on a large energy company that operates offshore oil and gas platforms in Denmark. The case study evaluates the usefulness of the proposed approach through a maintenance work configurator developed in the case company.FindingsThe case shows that early-stage co-scoping of a configurator and its performance metrics can ensure the alignment of configurator objectives and performance measures and can secure the data required to achieve comprehensive performance measurements. These measures, in turn, support the continuous improvement of the configurator in its subsequent development cycles. The results of the empirical case study suggest that the approach produces considerable benefits in cost reduction and improved efficiency in configurator development.Originality/valueExisting approaches to configurator development and implementation place little emphasis on the derivation and decision-support capability of performance measures. To address this, the proposed approach provides a structured, integrated method to continuously guide the development and implementation of configurator projects through performance assessment."

        "abstract": "\n BACKGROUND\n Unfractionated heparin (UFH), is an anticoagulant drug considered a high-risk medication in that an excessive dose can cause bleeding, while an insufficient dose can lead to a recurrent embolic event. Following initiation of intravenous (IV) UFH, the therapeutic response is monitored using a measure of blood clotting time known as the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Clinicians iteratively adjust the dose of UFH to a target aPTT range, with the usual therapeutic target range between 60 to 100 seconds.\n \n \n OBJECTIVE\n The aim of this study was to develop and validate a ML algorithm to predict, aPTT within 12 hours after a specified bolus and maintenance dose of UFH.\n \n \n METHODS\n This was a retrospective cohort study of 3273 episodes of care from January 2017 to August 2020 using data collected from electronic health records (EHR) of five hospitals in Queensland, Australia. Data from four hospitals were used to build and test ensemble models using cross validation, while the data from the fifth hospital was used for external validation. Modelling was performed using H2O Driverless AI\u00ae an automated ML tool, and 17 different experiments were conducted in an iterative process to optimise model accuracy.\n \n \n RESULTS\n In predicting aPTT, the best performing experiment produced an ensemble with 4x LightGBM models with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 31.35. This dataset was re-purposed as a multi-classification task (sub-therapeutic, therapeutic, and supra-therapeutic aPTT result) and achieved a 59.9% accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.735. External validation yielded similar results: RMSE of 30.52 +/- 1.29 for the prediction model, and accuracy of 56.8% +/- 3.15 and AUC of 0.724 for the multi-classification model.\n \n \n CONCLUSIONS\n According to our knowledge, this is the first study of ML applied to IV UFH dosing that has been developed and externally validated in a multisite adult general medical inpatient setting. We present the processes of data collection, preparation, and feature engineering for purposes of replication.\n"

        "abstract": "Traditionally, working memory is conceptualized as a system involved in the maintenance and manipulation of information in the absence of external stimulation. Intuitively, working memory might be considered a formalized system for describing thought (Jonides, 1995). When you consider what is \u201con your mind\u201d\u2014from mental images to inner speech\u2014you are considering your working memory. In this conceptualization, working memory is transient\u2014lasting for however long the thought remains useful, typically on the order of seconds. Functionally, working memory is a mental work space that is critical for higher-level cognitive abilities. Several tasks have been devised to measure the capacity of working memory or the amount of information one can hold in mind (Luck & Vogel, 1997; Turner & Engle, 1989). Individual differences in performance on these tasks predict reasoning, planning, problem-solving, and a variety of other cognitive abilities (Carpenter, Just, & Shell, 1990; Daneman & Carpenter, 1980; Daneman & Merikle, 1996; Fukuda, Vogel, Mayr, & Awh, 2010; Just & Carpenter, 1992), demonstrating the importance of having a large mental work space. As a result of its broad impact, a clear understanding of working memory is essential for understanding cognition. Because of its central importance, working memory has been a topic of intense interest in psychology and neuroscience. Foundational research in working memory was performed by Baddeley and colleagues, and to this day Baddeley\u2019s multicomponent model remains one of the most influential models of working memory (Baddeley, 1986, 2012; Baddeley & Hitch, 1974). Although a full treatment of the model and the data that support it is outside the scope of this chapter, certain key assumptions of the model lay the groundwork for the issues to come. First, the model assumes that working memory is distinct from long-term memory. That is, the processes that underlie the temporary maintenance of information for working memory can be distinguished from the processes that underlie the more permanent retention of information associated with long-term memory. Second, the model assumes distinct representational bases for different kinds of information. For example, materials that can be verbalized (e.g., words, letters) are represented in a qualitatively distinct way from materials that can be visualized (e.g., faces, scenes). Finally, the model assumes that processes that select, modulate, and manipulate retained information are"
