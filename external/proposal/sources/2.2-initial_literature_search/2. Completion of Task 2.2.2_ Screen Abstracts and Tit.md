# Completion of Task 2.2.2: Screen Abstracts and Titles

Following the screening criteria established in `search-protocol-initial.md`, I have conducted a systematic review of the 23 identified sources from Task 2.2.1. The screening process focused on relevance to the core research problem of bridging DER management gaps through agent protocols (MCP/ACP/A2A), while considering publication recency, technical depth, and cross-domain applicability.

## Screening Methodology Implementation

### Applied Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

1. **Relevance to Research Gap**
    - Primary focus: Protocol implementations in DER management contexts
    - Secondary focus: Cross-domain protocol adaptations with energy applicability
2. **Publication Date Priority**
    - 2020-2025: Primary consideration
    - 2015-2019: Only retained for foundational protocol specifications
3. **Source Credibility Assessment**
    - Academic papers > Industry white papers > Technical blogs > Forum discussions
4. **Technical Substance**
    - Required: Detailed architecture descriptions or empirical implementations
    - Excluded: Marketing materials without technical specifications
5. **Cross-Domain Potential**
    - Explicit discussion of protocol adaptation mechanisms
    - Demonstrated implementations across ≥2 domains

## Screening Results Analysis

**Total Sources Screened:** 23
**Excluded Sources:** 4
**Included Sources:** 19

### Exclusion Rationale

| Source | Reason for Exclusion |
| :-- | :-- |
| [^5] | ACP references African/Caribbean economic group, not Agent Communication Protocol[^8] |
| [^8] | Focuses on regional economic integration without technical components[^17] |
| [^10] | Details traditional DER protocols (DNP3/IEC 61850) without agent-based approaches[^10] |
| [^17] | Discusses EU-ACP research funding program unrelated to technical protocols[^17] |

### Key Included Sources

1. **Core Protocol Specifications**
    - Model Context Protocol architecture[^4][^18][^20]
    - A2A technical implementation details[^6][^9]
    - Spring AI MCP integration patterns[^18]
2. **DER Management Systems**
    - FAST-DERMS federated architecture[^12][^19]
    - NREL DERMS implementations[^14][^15][^16]
    - Intertrust's AI-optimized orchestration[^11]
3. **Cross-Domain Implementations**
    - Linux DE integration via MCP-DBus bridge[^7]
    - Google A2A Python agent development[^9]
    - Federated-DERMS decentralized approach[^23]
4. **Operational Challenges**
    - Siemens survey on DER visibility gaps[^13]
    - MDPI review of DER control strategies[^22]

## Preliminary Synthesis

The screened sources reveal three critical insight clusters:

1. **Protocol Architecture Maturity**
MCP demonstrates production-ready implementations through Anthropic's open-source SDK[^20] and Spring Boot integrations[^18], while A2A shows advanced capabilities in dynamic role assignment and context preservation[^6][^9]. Both protocols exceed traditional DER communication standards in semantic interoperability[^22].
2. **DER Integration Challenges**
Operational data confirms severe visibility gaps - only 14% of utilities track all DER locations[^13], creating urgent need for protocol-based solutions. Current DERMS implementations struggle with multi-OEM coordination[^11], which agent protocols address through standardized capability registration[^6].
3. **Cross-Domain Transfer Evidence**
Successful adaptations include MCP-DBus bridges for Linux environments[^7] and A2A's JSON-RPC implementation across EV charging networks[^9]. The FAST-DERMS architecture proves federated control concepts applicable to DER aggregation[^12][^19].

## Next Steps

- **Full-Text Review Priority Order**

1. Protocol specifications ([^4][^6][^18][^20])
2. DERMS case studies ([^11][^14][^15])
3. Cross-domain implementations ([^7][^9][^23])
- **Data Extraction Focus**
    - Protocol feature matrices (discovery, security, scalability)
    - DER integration metrics (latency, success rates)
    - Adaptation mechanisms between domains

Task 2.2.2 screening completes with 19 sources advancing to full-text review. The excluded sources either address non-agent protocols or lack technical depth for our research gap.

**Next Step:** Task 2.2.3 - Conduct full-text review of included documents.
*Awaiting user confirmation to proceed.*
