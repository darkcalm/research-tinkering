ABSTRACT = {The Smart Grid (SG) is nowadays an essential part of modern society, providing two-way energy flow and smart services between providers and customers. The main drawback is the SG complexity, with an SG composed of multiple layers, with devices and components that have to communicate, integrate, and cooperate as a unified system. Such complexity brings challenges for ensuring proper reliability, resilience, availability, integration, and security of the overall infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce a new smart grid testing management platform (herein called SGTMP) for executing real-time hardware-in-the-loop SG tests and experiments that can simplify the testing process in the context of interconnected SG devices. We discuss the context of usage, the system architecture, the interactive web-based interface, the provided API, and the integration with co-simulations frameworks to provide virtualized environments for testing. Furthermore, we present one main scenario about the stress-testing of SG devices that can showcase the applicability of the platform.},

  abstract      = {Numerical simulation has become essential tool of the design process and is widely used for the validation and evaluation of smart grid solutions and applications. However, domain specific tools are able to model a system only for a particular domain i.e., electric power system tool can model only power systems and for a intelligent control it has no provision to design AI based decision making algorithms, which can be developed in Multi-agent System tool. Thus for in-depth realistic analysis a co-simulation approach is required for simulating multi-domain systems. This paper presents a framework for co-simulation with the tools from three different domains covering power system, artificial intelligence and communication to simulate and analyse the smart grid applications. DigSILENT PowerFactory, a dedicated power system simulator, is interfaced with JADE (Java Agent Based Environment), an AI tool, using Application Programming Interface (API) through Python script. OMNeT++ was used as a communication simulator. Problem of voltage stabilization in power distribution network was addressed using Multi-Agent System (MAS) based approach for the validation of the proposed framework. Results show that co-simulation approach is effective for the realistic analysis of smartgrid applications.},

From year 2000 it became a standard and much attention has been given to it because of its ability to integrate different applications, providing synchronization among them. Smart grid is one of the applications that may take advantages of this approach because it connects different information and communication technology (ICT) architectures and power systems. The goal of this paper is to describe several aspects of co-simulation, that are required to develop a framework, and discuss the simulation architecture design. We propose an integration of simulators Simulink, Omnet++ and JADE, a multiagent framework, to develop smart grid applications. In addition, we illustrate this integration using one case study of a 33 modified radial-distribution network when power failure happens. We demonstrate the ICT and electric models and simulation results.},

In this paper, we build on our previous experiences to build a comprehensive co-simulation platform for CPSs. The newly developed platform enjoys several indispensable features. In the process of discussing the steps to engineer the platform, we present several design alternatives that might prove beneficial in other future tools that combine different simulator environments.

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to propose and develop a co-simulation platform that allows performing real-time monitoring and control tests and simulations for MV/LV grids.

The platform allows the analysis of realistic MV/LV grids and communication networks and will facilitate the simulation and comparison of low voltage control strategies for real-time test scenarios that could be more complicated to test in the reality due to cost and complexity aspects (i.e. high power losses on the low voltage grid).},

Another important application is the Volt Ampere Reactive (VAR) control which aims at flattening the voltage profile and improving the power factor, which reduces the losses and eventually reduces the demand. PV solar systems can provide not only active power but also reactive power and hence, they can be exploited by the VAR Control application. Optimized Volt-VAR Control (OVVC) is a combination of these two applications that seeks an optimal coordination of different units to improve the performance of the power grid and save energy.

Better management is especially important for the purpose of improving resilience of power delivery, for example in the case where part of the distribution system islands during a blackout to provide service to critical loads. To model such situations, an accurate description of power flow must be coupled to an accurate description how customers use electricity services. Here, a co-simulation involving a bottom-up residential load synthesis framework and the GridLAB-D distribution system simulator is described. An example based on a real distribution feeder, combining residential loads, a set of critical loads, including a hospital, a supermarket and a water treatment plant, as well as a large battery and a distribution-level solar array, is used to demonstrate the combined capabilities of the customer load and distribution models. The example shows how demand-response behavior can be modeled with the co-simulation. An enhanced capacity to integrate human behavior models with power flow simulators will become essential for designing distribution management systems, as grid modernization leads to more customer-owned devices that can be used to match generation and load.},

RunTS controls the application of state-changes, passing these to specific simulators to determine new steady-states. Messages can pass between simulations concerning configuration data, commands and results. Simulators must meet connectability criteria. The method allows variable periods between simulation stages rather than a fixed tempo, and can undertake specific simulation sequences unique to each event, through use of a novel per-event state-machine.

In this work we introduce a co-simulation framework, which is developed to analyse properties of custom smart grid solutions. We combine classical power system simulations, reactive smart grid components coupled to actors and use CIM as an intermediate model.

Different tools are then needed: software tools able to simulate the dynamic of interdependent infrastructures and benchmarks with coupled-components. Therefore, two combined simulators (coupling dedicated software tools) of power system, communication and information models are presented in this panel paper. The first aims at identifying the vulnerabilities resulting from the interdependencies among the Transmission power grid and the Information and Communication system.

In order to investigate the degree to which a cyber-contingency affects power system operations, we first categorize the potential impacts on the information flow respecting the end-to-end information features in terms of delayed, disordered, dropped, and distorted data. A simplified co-simulation model is then put forth for analyzing the interdependencies between energy and information flows, and obtaining the quantitative relation between information features and power system operations. As the operational characteristics of a cyber system can be entirely captured by all end-to-end information flows, our developed model is hence termed as the information flow based co-simulation model. The information flow based model features in low complexity and covering potential cyber contingencies. Moreover, the quantitative relation can provide requirements for the planning and operation of cyber systems. To illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed model, a comparison with the commercial communication simulation software OPNET is made. Finally, a wide-area damping control application is taken as an example to demonstrate physical impacts of various cyber-contingencies.},

  abstract      = {The ongoing modernization of power grids consists of integrating them with communication networks in order to achieve robust and resilient control of grid operations. To understand the operation of the new smart grid, one approach is to use simulation software. Unfortunately, current power grid simulators at best utilize inadequate approximations to simulate communication networks, if at all. Cooperative simulation of specialized power grid and communication network simulators promises to more accurately reproduce the interactions of real smart grid deployments. However, co-simulation is a challenging problem. A co-simulation must manage the exchange of information, including the synchronization of simulator clocks, between all simulators while maintaining adequate computational performance. This paper describes two new conservative algorithms for reducing the overhead of time synchronization, namely Active Set Conservative and Reactive Conservative. We provide a detailed analysis of their performance characteristics with respect to the current state of the art including both conservative and optimistic synchronization algorithms. In addition, we provide guidelines for selecting the appropriate synchronization algorithm based on the requirements of the co-simulation. The newly proposed algorithms are shown to achieve as much as 14{\%} and 63{\%} improvement in performance, respectively, over the existing conservative algorithm.},

We propose a heuristic algorithm to do load balancing in distribution networks affected by service restoration activities. Balancing is achieved through the use of utility directed usage of battery energy storage systems (BESS). This is achieved through demand response (DR) type signals that the utility communicates to individual buildings. We report simulation results on two test cases constructed with a 9-bus distribution network and a 57-bus distribution network, respectively.

In order to assess the performance of communication technologies for smart grid applications and find the most appropriate, co-simulation tools are crucial to simulate the behavior of both physical and cyber systems simultaneously, and properly consider their mutual interaction in planning and operation studies. This article aims at evaluating some wireless and wired communication technologies for smart grid implementation. The analysis performed shows that wireless technologies are potentially suitable for smart grid applications, while a combination of mixed wireless and wired technologies may introduce latencies that cannot match with mission critical functions, such as network protection.},

  abstract      = {Future power systems in terms of Cyber - Physical Energy Systems (CPES) apply the integration of IT and physical processes using local and wide area communication networks. The smart grid is a typical example of the application of CPES and poses additional challenges to the engineering as these networks consist of two components: the power system itself and an underlying communication network applied for transmitting monitoring and control information. Therefore, performance evaluations of CPES need to take into account both networks in detail in order to provide meaningful results. In this paper, we introduce our simulation environment INtegrated co-Simulation of Power and ICT systems for Real-time Evaluation (INSPIRE), which is based on the Hybrid Simulator Architecture [1] and capable of evaluating both power system and communication network within a co-simulation framework. Besides the simulator architecture, we detail our time synchronization approach, which is applied for interconnecting communication and power system simulation. Secondly, we present reference scenarios and configuration settings for the combined simulation system. Finally, we introduce the first performance evaluation carried out using INSPIRE, covering characteristics of the communication network and highlighting the retroactive effects on the power system using an exemplary control algorithm.},

Future power systems - especially Smart Grids - will increasingly rely on software and therefore extend the interwoven dependencies between the power system and its Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure. This, in turn, will inevitably lead to increased system complexity and as a consequence to new management, safety and security challenges. We believe that encapsulating the monitoring, control or protection software in Virtual Machines (VMs) is able to provide a remedy for many of these challenges. However, to the best of our knowledge there exists no work on how to develop or test virtualized power system applications nor on how the complex dependencies between the power system and the ICT could be taken into account during the development of such an application. In this paper we present a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) co-simulation architecture which addresses both of these issues. Further, we provide a proof of concept of our development and evaluation platform for virtualized CPES applications and discuss the benefits and challenges to this approach.},

To reduce installation costs and spatial limits, wireless communications are considered as effective communication techniques in smart grid.

  abstract      = {Microgrids have been proposed as a key piece of the Smart Grid vision to enable the potential of renewable energy generation. Microgrids are required to operate in both grid connected and standalone island mode using local sources of power. A major challenge in implementing microgrids is the communications and control to support transition to and from grid connected mode and operation in island mode. Microgrids consists of two interdependent networks, namely; the power distribution and data communication networks. To accurately capture the overall operation of the system, we propose a co-simulation model driven by embedded power controllers. Further, we propose a novel co-simulation scheduler taking into account events from both the power and communication network simulators, as well as the timing of each embedded controller's execution loop to adaptively synchronize both simulators efficiently. The approach ensures minimal synchronization error while still providing the ability to simulate extended operational scenarios. The numerical results illustrate the novelty of the propose co- simulation to study the microgrid power and communication networks interactions, and the effect on the power stability.},

As more and more Internet of Things (IoT) devices with measurement and/or control capability are designed and deployed for a more stable and efficient power system, the role of communication network has become more important. To evaluate the performance of control algorithms for inter-dependent power grid and communication network, a test bed that could simulate inter-dependent power grid and communication network is desirable. In this paper, we demonstrate the design and implementation of a novel co-simulator, which would effectively evaluate IoT-aided algorithms for scheduling the jobs of electrical appliances. There are three major features of our co-simulator: 1) large-scale test is achieved by distributed modules that are designed based on a Turing-indistinguishable approach; 2) remote servers or test devices are controlled by local graphical user interface (we only need to configure the simulator on a local server); 3) a software virtual network approach is employed to emulate real networks, which significantly reduces the cost of real-world test beds. To evaluate our co-simulator, two energy consumption scheduling algorithms are implemented. Experimental results show that our co-simulator could effectively evaluate these methods. Thus our co-simulator is a powerful tool for utility companies and policy makers to commission novel IoT devices or methods in future smart grid infrastructure.},

  abstract      = {Traditional state estimators require longer scan time, leading to delayed, and inaccurate state estimation. Given the increased deployment trend of phasor measurement units (PMUs), it is expected that all-PMU state estimation will eventually replace traditional or mixed state estimators at the control centers of power utilities. Due to the repeated calibration of the voltage and current transformers at the measurement sites, and direct time-synchronized measurement of phasors, the estimated state by an all-PMU state estimator is not only accurate, but also available at a rapid rate, leading to the use of the system state for protection, stabilization, and even calibration of the measuring devices. However, due to high reliance on an advanced communication network infrastructure for the delivery of large amount of measurements in real-time, the cyber attack surface of the power system is increased. Deliberate cyber attacks or unintentional network failures can affect the state estimator leading to misoperations of the power system. In this paper, we study the cyber security impacts on the all-PMU state estimator, using a power system and data network co-simulation method. A linear state estimator for a model of the New England 39-bus system and the corresponding data network is built in a global event-driven co-simulation platform “GECO” which was developed and leveraged for our experimental setup. The co-simulation of PSLF (power system simulator) and NS-2 (network simulator) is run with injection of attacks on the network. The injected cyber attacks in the form of network failures or malicious data injection are simulated and their effects are observed. We also, observe the robustness of the all-PMU state estimator, when the number of affected measurements is below a threshold.},

  abstract      = {Modernization of the power system in a way that ensures a sustainable energy system is arguably one of the most pressing concerns of our time. Buildings are important components in the power system. First, they are the main consumers of electricity and secondly, they do not have constant energy demand. Conventionally, electricity has been difficult to store and should be consumed as it is generated. Therefore, maintaining the demand and supply is critical in the power system. However, to reduce the complexity of power models, buildings (i.e., end-use loads) are traditionally modeled and represented as aggregated “dumb” nodes in the power system. This means we lack effective detailed whole building energy models that can support requirements and emerging technologies of the smart power grid. To gain greater insight into the relationship between building energy demand and power system performance, it is important to constitute a co-simulation framework to support detailed building energy modeling and simulation within the power system to study capabilities promised by the modern power grid. This paper discusses ongoing work at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and presents underlying tools and framework needed to enable co-simulation of building, building energy systems and their control in the power system to study applications such as demand response, grid-based HVAC control, and deployment of buildings for ancillary services. The optimal goal is to develop an integrated modeling and simulation platform that is flexible, reusable, and scalable. Results of this work will contribute to future building and power system studies, especially those related to the integrated `smart grid'. Results are also expected to advance power resiliency and local (micro) scale grid studies where several building and renewable energy systems transact energy directly. This paper also reviews some applications that can be supported and studied using the framework introduced to understand their implications before they can be successfully implemented in the power system.},

  abstract      = {A nation of nanogirds could offer us many opportunities in energy management, yet it presents several challenges. The key advantageous feature of nanogrids is the localized distributed control where all allocations are done by loads. Combining this key feature with the e-mobility potentials in supporting the grid, we propose a novel decentralized distributed scheme for coordinating the charging of multiple plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) within the smart nanogrid framework. Our distributed scheme was co-simulated from both perspectives, power and communication, over a converged broadband fiber-wireless communication infrastructure. For a network of 335 residential customers, power system results proved efficiency providing 14{\%} peak shaving while meeting drivers' requirements. Communication results compared to a centralized benchmark scheme presented better performance, measuring an upstream traffic of 0.65 Mbps with a maximum delay of 0.8 ms at the controller end.},

Especially due to the coupling between ICT and power systems a holistic approach for testing and validating is required. Taking existing (quasi-) standardised smart grid system and test specification methods as a starting point, we are developing a holistic testing and validation approach that allows a very flexible way of assessing the system level aspects by various types of experiments (including virtual, real, and mixed lab settings). This paper describes the formal holistic test case specification method and applies it to a particular co-simulation experimental setup. The various building blocks of such a simulation (i.e., FMI, mosaik, domain-specific simulation federates) are covered in more detail. The presented method addresses most modeling and specification challenges in cyber-physical energy systems and is extensible for future additions such as uncertainty quantification.},

New control methods and algorithms are being studied to address these challenges, but the effects of such algorithms on actual DNs are often difficult to validate. Co-simulation, considering the advanced state of existing DN simulation tools, is a potential solution but usually requires some degree of expertise. In this work, we introduce a framework for implementing control algorithms for DNs assisted by co-simulation. This framework uses the commercial simulator PowerFactory but does not require a high tool-specific expertise and can be integrated into other simulation tools. Then we apply this framework to an electric vehicle charging use case and show the results and benefits. Furthermore we extend an existing charging control algorithm to support local voltage control.},

  abstract      = {Energy systems experience a rise in complexity: new technologies, topologies and components, tighter links to other systems like markets and the increased usage of information technology. This leads to challenging questions that can not be answered via traditional methods. The goal of including renewable energy and clean technologies in the grid, however, requires solutions for the resulting complex problems. This paper investigates dynamic demand response for intelligent electric vehicle charging as a use-case for detailed hybrid models that cannot be properly handled by traditional tools alone. Universal modeling languages and specialized domain-specific modeling solutions are brought together via standardized co-simulation interfaces to achieve maximal flexibility and minimal implementation efforts. This combination of previously numerically incompatible modeling paradigms enables a detailed look into the dynamics of hybrid component models while keeping the comfort and the strength of established tools. This coupling of a Modelica-based physical simulation engine, a commercial power system simulation tool and an agent-based discrete event simulator for energy grids results in a novel co-simulation platform. This visionary concept provides the high level of detail, scope, flexibility, scalability and accuracy in simulations needed to analyze and optimize energy systems of the future.},

Considering the closely interconnection between power grid and communication network, there is an urgent need for joint simulation to thoroughly understand the impact on the communication network on the process of power system dynamics. In this paper, an co-simulation framework is presented to analyze the performance of power and network heterogeneous system. The synchronization method for coordinating simulators in this framework can be tuned according to the specific simulation application and take the impact on the co-simulation process into account due to message latency in communication network and decision time. Matlab for power system and NS3 for communication network are integrated to implement the framework, the experiment results validate the feasibility of proposed co-simulation framework. Besides, in this framework, the efficiency of simulation can be improved by the presented synchronization method.},

In order to support vulnerability assessment, with the exception of analytic methods, a suitable platform for security tests needs to be developed. In this paper we analyze the cyber security of energy management system (EMS) against data attacks. First we extend our analytic framework that characterizes data attacks as optimization problems with the objectives specified as security metrics and constraints corresponding to the communication network properties. Second, we build a platform in the form of co-simulation - coupling the power system simulator DIgSILENT PowerFactory with communication network simulator OMNeT++, and Matlab for EMS applications (state estimation, optimal power flow). Then the framework is used to conduct attack simulations on the co-simulation based platform for a power grid test case. The results indicate how vulnerable of EMS to data attacks and how co-simulation can help assess vulnerability.},

These factors need to be analyzed and optimized during the evaluation of their impact on the data stream based applications, which is essential in wide area measurement and monitoring systems (WAMS). This paper presents an integrative Power and Cyber systems (iPaCS) framework, and discusses the iPaCS testbed design for an integration of PMU and PDC software systems through ns-3 cyber simulator. PMU and PDC software packages of an iPDC open-source software system installed in dedicated virtual machines act as measurement emulators for a power system network, whereas a dedicated virtual machine used for executing the ns-3 software system simulates networks of communicating nodes and the traffic between them. Linux containers, lightweight virtualization technology, are used for creating the virtual machines environment. The iPaCS testbed is suitable to evaluate applications such as 1) impact of latency and bandwidth on WAMS data stream based control and protection applications, 2) congestion effect due to various data traffic scenarios between PMU and PDC systems, and 3) impact of cyber attacks on power system networks. A two area four-machine power system is considered to demonstrate the testbed for various datasets in a cyber network topology.

An approach called co-simulation is often used in CPS conceptual design to integrate the specialized tools and simulators from each of these domains into a joint simulation for the evaluation of design decisions. Many co-simulation platforms are being developed to expedite CPS conceptualization and realization, but most use intrusive modeling and communication libraries that require researchers to either abandon their existing models or spend considerable effort to integrate them into the platform. A significant number of these co-simulation platforms use the High Level Architecture (HLA) standard that provides a rich set of services to facilitate distributed simulation. This paper introduces a simple gateway that can be readily implemented without co-simulation expertise to adapt existing models and research infrastructure for use in HLA. An open-source implementation of the gateway has been developed for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) co-simulation platform called the Universal CPS Environment for Federation (UCEF).},

This offers unprecedented opportunities for flexible and customized production and distribution. However, these complex and interconnected systems need new approaches for operation. Assistance system similar to those known from the automotive sector will support operators in their task to provide a safe, efficient and undisturbed operation of production systems. The paper supports, that more complex functionalities of assistance systems are based on simulation. This paper discusses the question how well co-simulation approaches are suited for this task. Co-simulation is the joint simulation of independent simulators each representing a component or subsystem of the overall system. The modularity of co-simulation reflects the modularity of production systems. It is possible to compose a simulation by using existing models. It is easy to adapt co-simulation to different configurations of production systems or changes in topology. The inherent flexibility of co-simulation makes it possible to cover broad range of requirements regarding, among others, simulation speed and precision. Co-simulation further allows to include models as “black boxes” which can be used to protect intellectual property on the modeled components. However, co-simulation always comes with additional costs for communication. Data exchange between models sets upper bounds for simulation speed. This limits the application of co-simulation: If requirements on calculation speed are very high other approaches like hybrid simulations are more suitable. For very precise simulations parallel simulation may be appropriate.},

  abstract      = {The use of distributed computation and control is pervasive for a wide range of smart grid research topics. However, recent developments of smart grid co-simulation platforms have not been able to provide effective support for the modeling and simulation of distributed software systems. In particular, cosimulation literatures only focused on the integration of electrical and communication network simulators, and the responsibility for modeling distributed software is often delegated to one of these two simulators. Since these domain specific simulators are not designed for this purpose, such delegation incurs many limitations that prevent convenient, effective, and accurate modeling of software behaviors. To mitigate the problem, this paper presents, to our knowledge, the first co-simulation integration of direct-execution simulators to provide dedicated support for distributed smart grid software. We first present the development of the novel DecompositionJ framework (DEterministic, COncurrent Multi-PrOcessing SImulaTION for Java programs), which is a compiler-based code analyzer and transformer to automatically convert multi-thread Java programs into direct-execution simulators, eliminating the need for manual code or model development. Next, we apply DecompositionJ framework to generate simulators for a popular multi-agent platform JADE. The JADE simulators are then integrated with electromagnetic transient simulator (PSCAD) and packet-level network simulator (OPNET) using standardized co-simulation runtime infrastructure. At last, we conduct a case study on agent-based smart grid restoration using this novel co-simulation platform. Through the analysis of simulation results, it is shown that the proposed direct-execution simulation framework is able to facilitate the understanding, evaluation, and debugging of distributed smart grid software.},

This study presents a method of digital real-time co-simulation (DRTCoS) applied to smart grid integrated with large-scale DR resources. First, the strategy that decoupling the network with DR resources from the rest parts according to different dynamic responses is proposed, building the multi-rate digital simulation, and an interface algorithm for the co-simulation is devised. Then DRTCoS that combines real-time digital simulator and the power distribution system simulation, GridLAB-D, is built, with typical application scenarios on micro-grid and high-voltage grid studied. Finally, case study validates the effectiveness of the co-simulation based on large-scale air-conditioning loads.},

Cyber attacks must be simulated to analyze the consequences on the power grid. Thus, the cyber system must be modeled explicitly and integrated with the power grid model. This paper describes the development and simulation of a novel co-simulation framework that integrates both the cyber and power systems. The objective is to implement the ICT model for real-time interactions with both the power grid and transmission operator. Different industrial grade environments have been developed to simulate the cyber-power interactions. ICT events that may affect the stability of the grid, e.g., cyber attacks, are simulated at the cyber system layer, and their impact analysis is conducted at the power system layer.

Co-simulation will become more and more important as means of testing since smart grids are multi-domain systems and as such too complex for one expert to model and analyze. However, simulation always carries uncertainty, which might defeat the purpose of testing safety-critical systems if not considered properly. The quantification of this uncertainty is of paramount importance for the design of reliable testing frameworks. Since this issue has not yet gained much attention in the smart grid simulation community, this paper presents an exemplary uncertainty quantification of a grid simulation to underline the acuteness of the issue.

Free and open available tools like GridLAB-D, PSAT, OpenModelica and 4DIAC are well known and widely used because of their excellent domain specific expertise. With co-simulation approaches the individual strengths of each tool can be exploited to model and simulate the various aspects of complex smart grids.

This paper demonstrates a local smart charging control strategy implemented with the IEC 61499-based standard for distributed control systems.

Battery models are defined in OpenModelica and embedded as individual dynamic loads. The power system is simulated using PSAT.

The energy generated by the PV panels, the instantaneous power consumption in the buildings as well as the temperature variations inside the building are simulated, while the exchange of information and the control operations are implemented in hardware on development kits in order to assess the impact of realistic communication and control solutions. The advantage of the co-simulation architecture is the ability to emulate in a short time phenomena that are otherwise slow (such as temperature changes), thus providing a solution for fast prototyping of control and communication architectures for smart grids.We also integrate the control of AC and batteries into a new single control strategy. Main contributions of the paper are: a simplification of both the PV model and the power consumption models present in the literature, the integration of the models for the PV panels, battery, thermal system and power load models into a single simulator, the design of a control and communication architecture for the optimization of the power consumption, the integration of the control of the AC into the battery control. Results obtained with the co-simulation architecture are presented and discussed.},

The communication interruption and latency may cause security and stability issues in power system. Thus, studying the dynamic procedure of the interaction between power system and communication network in fault situation becomes more and more important. In this paper, by analyzing the weakness of the existing co-simulation frameworks, a new co-simulation framework, Global Status Event-Based Iterative Co-simulation Framework, is proposed, in which a global event scheduler manages the communication simulator and power simulator, and power simulator will run iterative simulation as a new event is identified and added to the global event scheduler. Then, a co-simulation platform based on the proposed framework is introduced which integrates the power system simulator and communication network simulator. Finally, a case is studied and reveals the procedure of the cascading failures in both power system and communication network, which cannot be captured by the simulation of a single system.},

Therefore, simulation tools that allow the evaluation of these interactions will be vital in the near future. Co-simulators emerge as powerful alternatives that make it possible to integrate widely used power and communication network simulators. However, the process of building a co-simulator is a challenging task that involves knowledge from different areas such as power and energy systems, communication systems, and computer science. To support the development of advanced co-simulators and related studies, this paper presents the implementation details of a simple co-simulator that uses OpenDSS to simulate the power network, OMNeT++ to simulate the communication network, and a PHP Server and Python scripts to establish the interoperation of these software tools.

First the architecture of “OpSim” is presented, which uses a message bus to connect and synchronize multiple simulators, representing the grid, as well as grid operators strategies. Second, a proof-of-concept is demonstrated in which an interaction between multiple grid operators is investigated. The message rate between simulation components is evaluated and results indicate that a stable simulation operation is possible.

In this paper, the existing co-simulation schemes and corresponding structures are analyzed. The essential difference between mathematical models of power flow and information flow makes it necessary to build a real-time co-simulation platform. Based on power system simulation tool RT-LAB and communication system simulation tool OPNET, a real-time co-simulation platform for CPPS was proposed with originally developed data transmission interface and conversion module. Furthermore, to extend the functions and accuracy of the platform, dynamic simulated devices are accessed to form a mixed-signal cosimulation platform, which is capable of simulating the dynamic characteristics of system precisely with high speed.

However, this hybrid system also increases the risk of being compromised by cyber-attacks. If the control system is attacked, power systems will be out of order and black out may be occurred. Furthermore, various systems, including the communication network, will stop working as power systems are the critical infrastructure of our society. To assess and research the cascading effect between communication networks and physical power system networks, a hybrid co-simulation platform is proposed in this paper. By using synchronization mechanism, this platform integrates both power system network simulator and communication network simulator.
