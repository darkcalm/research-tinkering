Executive Summary
In 2024, the solar industry demonstrated remarkable growth and resilience, surpassing 2
terawatts (TW) in global capacity just two years after broaching 1 terawatt [1]. The
photovoltaic (PV) market has cemented its position as a robust and competitive
alternative to traditional energy generation, with the International Energy Agency (IEA)
projecting solar to account for 80% of renewables growth by 2030 with strong installation
from some of the world’s largest economies: [2][3]
China is expected to account for 60% of global capacity expansion.
The European Union is forecasted to 2x their installed capacity by 2030.
India is expected to emerge as the fourth-largest market, growing 3.5x in capacity.
The United States installed 40.5GW in 2024, bringing the total to 219 GW. The sector
has solidified its role as an economic driver, with $60 billion in private investment and
280,000 jobs nationwide.
However, expansive growth in the solar industry is not without its challenges, especially
as a maturing fleet reveals new and at times unexpected risk categories:
Equipment-driven underperformance has tripled over the last 5 years, highlighting a
continued need for efficiently deploying resources for reporting issues and corrective
maintenance.
Increasing risk profiles, emphasized by solar’s exposure to climate change-driven
risks, such as storms, floods and fires. Industry models continue to underestimate the
effects of weather-related events by 300+% [4]. Asset owners have turned to creative
methods to manage risk, such as preventative investment in design and maintenance
to reduce costs.
Ongoing labor constraints, especially as operators contend with both increasing fleet
sizes and average installed capacity. In the U.S. specifically, “nearly 70% of the true
cost of solar O&M comes from labor-based inflationary costs” [5].

To that end, Raptor Maps has uncovered 4 main trends in this year’s Report:
While the growth in average underperformance year-over-year has slowed down, there
is still significant opportunity for owners to close the gap between modeled and
actual performance. In 2024, the average solar farm in our dataset lost up to
$5,720/MWdc per year from unresolved equipment issues. Extrapolated to the whole
industry, that indicates an annualized potential revenue loss of $10.0 billion [7] from
solar underperformance.
Owners and operators are both increasingly adopting AI and automation to reduce
truck rolls, deploying robotics (such as remotely operated drones) to investigate
specialized use cases. Among these inspections, erosion and cracking inspections
have become most popular, comprising 23% and 18% of non-aerial thermography
inspections, respectively.
High priority issues accounted for 42% of total identified issues, but were responsible
for 90% of observed revenue loss.
Over the past 5 years, underperformance has increased across sites of all sizes, but in
2024, we observed the widest range in performance across C&I assets.
These three industry-wide trends - rapid growth, changing energy
policy landscape, and increasing financial pressure - underscore the
importance of ensuring that already installed assets perform as
modeled to continue delivering reliable, low-cost clean energy.
Political headwinds, such as President Trump’s tariffs and the U.S. leaving the Paris
Climate Accords, could impact the growth of U.S. solar as infrastructure investors might
gravitate towards lenient policies for domestic natural gas. The momentum of solar
growth remains uncertain in the U.S., even as December projections still showed 43 GWdc
added annually over the next five years [6].

About the data
The Raptor Maps platform identifies and categorizes issues on solar assets that can
cause safety, compliance, or performance issues. Our normalized and aggregated
dataset of 193 GW contains data on issues ranging from damaged erosion BMPs to
module cracking to thermographic anomalies that indicate power loss. This allows us to
analyze the performance and conditions across solar assets and identify industry-wide
trends. 
Most of this report will focus on DC health, module cracking, and equipment-driven
underperformance – a potential $10B problem for the global solar industry.
In 2024 alone, the Raptor Maps platform analyzed data from 67 GW of PV systems, of
which 52 GW were for DC health analysis. Notably, lost capacity from equipment
anomalies has tripled (3.1x) over the last five years, underscoring the growing challenge
for solar owners and operators. The following section highlights key trends in DC health
performance, using data to validate patterns that many in the industry have already
sensed.
Power loss is calculated by applying a loss factor to each impacted module based on the
severity of the detected issue.
This year’s report applies a refined methodology to account for assets with multiple
inspections within the same year, which is a rising trend that Raptor Maps has observed.

Underperformance Continues to Rise
In 2024, power loss from DC health and other equipment issues (“power loss”) continued its
steady climb, with solar sites experiencing 5.77% underperformance, up from 5.00% in 2023
[1]. The consistent increase in power loss is expected as owners and operators navigate the
complexities of managing increasingly larger utility-scale solar sites and portfolios.

Industry Trends Underpinning
Rising Underperformance
Raptor Maps’ dataset provides an indicator into the overall DC health of already installed
solar capacity, providing further context into the following trends in labor and
manufacturing. 
First, in the United States, the growth of operational labor is failing to keep pace with
the rapid expansion of solar capacity. According to the US IREC Jobs Census and
SEIA/Wood Mackenzie, solar capacity has grown by 182% over the past five years
(2019-2023), while operational labor has increased by only 91% during the same period
[1][2]. With 27% of operations & maintenance hiring due to churn, the costs of hiring,
onboarding, and retention exert additional pressures on budgets and time [3].
Second, major strides in manufacturing have been made over the past decade, as
tracked by the PVEL Scorecard [4]. In fact, more than 20 new manufacturers were rated
Top Performers within the scorecard. However, PVEL has also observed a continued
rise in BOM-level failures with 41% of BOMs experiencing at least one failure - up from
32% in 2023. As the solar industry continues to mature and scale, efficiently monitoring
and managing potential equipment failures will be critical.
Finally, both the magnitude and frequency of natural catastrophe events continue to
grow. In the 2010s, there were 13.1 NOAA billion-dollar weather events per year. The
annual count more than doubled in 2024 with 27 billion-dollar weather events [5]. From
hail storms that cause cracking to lightning storms that can strike equipment, owners
and operators continue to prioritize timely extreme weather response, increasingly
relying on technology and innovative operating procedures to mitigate risk.

In 2024, Performance
Intelligence Is Bridging
Power Loss Gaps
Last year, Raptor Maps identified more than 10.8 million DC health issues across 44
unique gigawatts of solar assets analyzed, or 249 issues per MWdc. As more solar is
installed and a substantial portion of installed assets age, asset managers and O&M
teams continue to face the difficult act of balancing between corrective and
preventative maintenance of DC health issues and beyond. According to Raptor Maps’
dataset, 32% of identified issues were categorized as “High Priority”, accounting for
90% of the observed power loss. 56% and 12% of identified issues were “Low Priority”
and “Medium Priority”, respectively. Aerial inspections allow for rapid diagnosing and
geolocating of those “High Priority” issues, especially those causing SCADA alerts,
providing the necessary intelligence for effective and efficient remediation.
The data emphasizes the criticality of maintaining detailed records of solar asset
performance and site infrastructure conditions. While addressing immediate repairs
naturally demands attention when resources are limited, the analysis reveals that nearly
70% of identified issues fall into medium or low priority categories, making it very
difficult to track, much less remediate, non-high priority issues that are at risk of
escalating to larger problems - and which issues are not. This reality has led many
organizations to invest in centralized systems of record and more advanced methods
of capturing data to maintain clear documentation of these developing issues, including
more frequent and targeted inspections.

A Shift Towards Targeted,
Repeated Inspections
The key to employing performance intelligence is prioritizing the highest-impact issues
and leveraging data to make more informed resourcing decisions. In large-scale sites
between 50-200 MW, low-priority defects contribute just 0.2 kW of power loss per defect,
whereas high-priority defects cause 6-8 kW of power loss per defect. However, it is
important to note for C&I and smaller utility-scale farms, module-level defaults can cause
15-20% of power loss and are not insignificant when addressing site performance. Given
current labor constraints and tighter O&M budgets, fixing every defect is neither practical
nor cost-effective. Savvy operations teams have begun to shift towards data-informed,
targeted interventions to recover power faster while minimizing windshield time.
Furthermore, industry data reflects a shift away from treating aerial inspections as isolated
assessments and rather as a scalable approach towards preventative monitoring. Notably,
some owners and operators have internalized this trend, inspecting the same sites 70%
more in 2024 than in 2023.
With a growing volume of defects to remediate or monitor—estimated at nearly 249
defects per MW per year in 2024—operations teams are facing an overwhelming backlog
of issues to manage, and increasing inspection frequency is not viable. These trends
highlight the urgent need for technology solutions to efficiently identify, prioritize, and
monitor issues on solar farms without mobilizing personnel. As a result, many operators
are turning to new tools to support balancing between monitoring, preventative, and
corrective maintenance, ensuring the most critical issues are addressed at the right time.
Software-enabled sensors and on-site robotics provide frequent, autonomous, and
granular diagnoses into site health. This allows teams to be deployed efficiently, in a
timely manner, and only when human intervention is needed—reducing unnecessary truck
rolls, automating reports, and ensuring technicians arrive prepared with clear guidance and
necessary equipment, ensuring technician safety and reducing time spent on-site per task.

Different Needs for
Different Fleets
Elevated power loss from equipment issues creates different challenges and opportunities
for each solar industry segment. For example, commercial and industrial (C&I) sites less
than 5 MWdc experienced an average of 264 identified DC health issues per MWdc, which
presents significant lost revenue risk when aggregated at the fleet-level. With C&I and
community solar fleets typically spread across many different locations, balancing
preventative and corrective efforts can become difficult, but without those efforts, sites
risk higher magnitude events such as fires or outages.
In response, some asset owners and operators have unlocked economies of scope by
expanding the capabilities of their teams. For example, several of Raptor Maps’ customers
have trained technicians to fly drones and self-perform aerial data collection, enabling high
frequency performance insights on their assets and the reallocation of technician time
previously spent on manual inspections to more impactful activities.
As sites get larger, the volume of data and conditions that asset managers and O&M
teams must care about increases exponentially, with many requiring some form of manual
intervention. However, increasing portfolios, site sizes, and distances from population
centers have made it difficult to conduct all the activities under contract. As a result,
Raptor Maps has observed a rise in automation of many visual inspection activities with
remotely operated robotics. For example, Raptor Maps customers leverage remotely
operated drones installed on-site to conduct investigations of alerts from SCADA systems,
which allow for technicians to be deployed for remediation with the right tools, supplies,
and data. Furthermore, using remotely operated robotics as a first method of response
reduces technician exposure to potentially hazardous or high-voltage situations, drastically
increasing safety and supporting workforce retention efforts.

Automating Ground
Inspections & Site Walks
Remote operations are not the only solution to preserving technician time--customers
are also widely deploying aerial inspections for non-DC health use cases. In 2024, civil
works inspections were the most popular type of non-DC health inspection analyzed in
the Raptor Maps platform. Erosion/SWPPP and Perimeter Inspections make up more
than a third of all non-DC health orders. In addition, Specialty Cracking Inspections (e.g.
for the detection of hairline cracking) have also grown popular as a way to mitigate the
risk of fire and ground faults on utility-scale sites, making up 18% of non-aerial
thermography inspections.
Typical ground inspections are being replaced across the entire O&M ecosystem and
steadily increasing in cadence as well. Owners and operators have been increasing the
rate of aerial inspections on their assets over time, with inspections per site rising 70%
from 2023 to 2024. This includes all types of inspection types in the Raptor Maps
dataset. Historically, from 2019 to 2023, owners and operators typically conducted an
annual aerial inspection with an occasional mid-year check-in after a big storm or
performance issues.
More recently, the evolving needs of the asset owner have driven inspection cadences
up drastically. Technology has enabled the on-demand collection and analysis of data
at-scale, allowing for more proactive management of risk while reducing when truck rolls
are needed. Owners can now use aerial inspections as a preventative measure, rather
than deploying reactionary inspections - especially on utility-scale sites where site risks
can exacerbate and become very costly.

ANATOMY OF POWER LOSS
Raptor Maps’ Power Loss dataset measures lost
capacity due to DC health and other equipment
issues. While system-level faults continue to cause
the most power loss, 2024 also saw an increase in
physical damage and module-level issues, which
present increased fire and power loss risks that
owners need to manage across their fleet.

Raptor Maps’ 
Power Loss Dataset
The Raptor Maps dataset contains 172 GW of DC health-
driven power loss analytics and 21 GW of risk
management analytics (e.g. vegetation monitoring or
equipment defect detection), tagged with precise
geolocations of the detected issue and an actionable
categorization of what that issue is. The following
section provides trends in what Raptor Maps has
detected to be the leading drivers of power loss,
providing owners and operators with benchmarks for
their own assets. 
For the purposes of the Global Report, similar anomaly
types were grouped into categories, such as the “Diode”
category for both “Diode” (typically impacting 1/3 of the
module) and “Diode Multi” (typically impacting 2/3 of the
module) anomalies. 
Raptor Maps analytics also utilizes temperature readings
to provide further granularity into the anomaly (e.g. “Cell
Medium” which classifies if the area of the cell anomaly
is 10°-20°C higher than adjacent areas).

Large Equipment Remains
the Driver of Power Loss
System-level faults, such as those that impact an entire string or malfunctioning trackers,
continue to be the primary drivers of DC health-driven power loss within Raptor Maps’
dataset. The largest fault tag - inverters - continues to be the largest driver at 37% of
observed power loss in 2024. However, the average power loss observed from inverter
faults has remained steady year-over-year, while 2024 saw a rise in more string (+19%
since 2023) and combiner (+22%) faults compared to 2023. Average power loss from
malfunctioning or misaligned trackers, while still a larger driver, held steady year-over-year,
contributing to around 10% of observed power loss in 2024. In hail-prone regions,
malfunctioning trackers undermine hail damage mitigation efforts, which can cause
significant damage and insurance premium increases. The high incidence of power loss
from large equipment such as inverters or string-level anomalies highlight the ongoing
challenge of balancing corrective maintenance across fleets, but also represent low-
hanging fruit available to industry leaders when hoping to maximize performance. 
Conversely, we observed more granular module-level issues, such as overheating junction
boxes or activated diode bypasses, with an (+22%) increase from 2023. While they do not
contribute to significant and immediate revenue loss, these anomalies can degrade and
pose fire risk - highlighting another opportunity for applying advanced means of monitoring
without taking resources away from higher priority corrective maintenance.
Note: All Raptor Maps inspection results include granular categorization, but several anomalies are grouped
under “Module” and “Other” for the purposes of this report. All module- and submodule-level anomalies (e.g.
cell defects and cracking) are grouped into “Module” in this chart. “Other” anomalies include helix faults,
reverse polarity, lightning damage, amongst several other anomaly types. See definitions of Power Loss
Anomalies in the Raptor Maps Knowledge Hub here.

Power Loss by PV type and Anomaly, %
Module Technology and
Module Defects
While the selection of PV modules would not necessarily impact the
performance of larger equipment (such as inverters), analysis of
performance across assets using different types of modules reveals
that assets built with polycrystalline modules exhibited higher average
power loss from equipment issues compared to assets built with
monocrystalline and thin-film, while thin-film modules exhibited the
least power loss from module-specific defects.
Overall, thin-film assets performed very well at the module level in the
2024 dataset, with thin-film modules exhibiting roughly a quarter of the
module-level defects found in polycrystalline panels. While 70% of
module-level defects identified in thin-film were due to physical
damage, less physical damage was identified within thin-film modules
compared to monocrystalline and polycrystalline  modules in 2024. 55%
and 52% of monocrystalline and polycrystalline module-level defects
were attributed to damage, respectively. 
It is important to note that Raptor Maps’ issue identification focuses on
significant thermal events that are known drivers of power loss and fire
risk. As thin-film modules show more subtle temperature differentials,
Raptor Maps' thin-film analytics only identifies modules with known
defects that should be monitored or addressed. Raptor Maps continues
to expand and refine its methodology to ensure the most critical
defects are accurately identified during inspections of all types,
including through partnerships with leading manufacturers [1].
This data can be susceptible to many factors year over year, but in
regions susceptible to increasingly common extreme weather events, it
is clear higher rates of physical damage will be observed.

Escalating Power Loss,
Regardless of Site Size
Sites of all sizes experienced significant downswings in performance from DC health
and other equipment issues over the last 5 years, with only sites between 20 to 50
MWdc experiencing less underperformance on average in 2024 when compared to
2023. Underperformance has grown more rapidly on larger sites, with the average site
between 100 to 200 MWdc experiencing a 5.3x increase in underperformance within
the Raptor Maps dataset compared to a 2.3x increase in sites between 0 to 5 MWdc
and 3.1x increase across the dataset average.
However, 2024 data indicates less variability in underperformance across each site
size category compared to prior years. With an average annualized revenue loss
potential of $5,720 per MWdc, remediation of DC health issues are high-impact
interventions that will be essential for closing the gap between modeled and actual
performance.

Highest Variance in Performance Observed in C&I Assets
In the smallest sites (under 5 MW), the gap between the top performing 15% and the bottom performing 15% of assets was $12,901 per MW of annualized revenue loss, compared to the range
of $9,351 per MW for assets larger than 200 MW. This variance in performance presents a challenge to C&I owners and operators, emphasizing the need for clear and reliable data assets to
enable effective triaging and prioritization of issues. It is worth noting that the higher performing assets within the Raptor Maps dataset tend to be younger assets, reflecting a continued
challenge with keeping up with corrective maintenance and warranty guarantees as fleets age.

Smaller sites less than 10 MWdc had a higher
percentage of power loss caused by module-level issues
such as diodes and hot spots when compared to larger
sites. Within the “Other” category, Raptor Maps’ analysis
has found higher levels of shading and soiling in those
smaller systems. As soiling is not permanent in the way
an equipment defect may be and may be resolved prior
to an inspection, the Raptor Maps data is not intended to
fully capture the impact of soiling. However, given that
this is an aggregated benchmark across thousands of
sites less than 10 MWdc, C&I and community solar
owners and operators should take note, especially as
soiling is easiest to address earlier on.
Regardless of the capacity of the site, high priority faults,
such as inverter, string, and combiner issues, contribute
to the majority of observed power loss. This is especially
true for larger sites where more than 90% of power loss
were caused by inverter, string, combiner, and tracker
anomalies on sites greater than 50MWdc.

Equipment-driven Underperformance, No Matter Where You Go
Average Power Loss by U.S. Market
Last Five Years (2020 - 2024)
Underperformance increased over the past five years (2020 to 2024) across all U.S. electric power markets, with only ISO-NE assets experiencing a decrease in average underperformance year-
over-year when compared to 2023. Underperformance has grown most rapidly in the Southeast market, whereas the ERCOT and PJM markets have consistently experienced higher power loss
from DC health issues compared to the dataset average over the past several years.

Power Loss Drivers 
by U.S. Market
Faults like inverter and string anomalies continue to be
the largest drivers of power loss across each U.S. power
market, but there is wide variance in the impact of each
equipment on site power loss across power markets.
This emphasizes the importance of accurately
diagnosing issues to drive efficient remediation.
For example, the average asset in the U.S. in CAISO or the
Southeast experienced more power loss from tracker
issues compared to other markets, whereas the average
asset in markets with smaller average asset capacities,
such as NYISO and ISO-NE, has higher power loss from
module-level issues compared to the U.S. average.
Notably, ERCOT exhibits higher rates of physical
damage compared to other regions, with 3% of total
power loss attributed to physical damage compared to
the dataset average of 1%.

Approximating the Risk of
Weather-driven Damage by Market
While the exact reason for module damage can vary (from installation errors to foul balls
from the nearby baseball field), weather is one of the most significant drivers of module
damage. Measuring the average number of damaged modules tagged per megawatt
allows Raptor Maps to approximate extreme weather risk by market.
Storm-prone markets, ERCOT and the Southeast, are far more likely to experience damage
to their equipment, occurring at 16x and 6.5x, respectively, the average damaged modules
per MW in the market with the least physical damage per MW (NYISO) - even after
adjusting for outliers. 
Notably, ERCOT is one of the primary solar markets where hail risk is prominent and is also
exposed to tropical storms and hurricanes, reflected by a prominent focus on extreme
weather risk mitigation strategy for owners and operators in ERCOT. A dive into Raptor
Maps’ 2024 inspection data from ERCOT reveals that extensive damage from hail and
other storms is not guaranteed, but the potential magnitude of damage can be significant.
Moreover, cracks can propagate over time and increase the risk of failure or fire, making
frequent post-storm inspections important. Fortunately, innovation in the industry has
continued to show strong results in mitigating and managing risk in hail-prone regions.
As the industry is deeply familiar with, climate change will continue to exacerbate extreme
weather risk, increasing both the severity and the frequency of high-severity events. For
example, a 2024 study found that the smallest hailstones are expected to decrease in
frequency by an average of 25% while the largest hailstones are expected to increase in
frequency by 25% to 75%, depending on the emissions pathway [1]. Such projections point
to a need for continued evolution in managing weather risk and systematizing best
practices across the fleet.

With global capacity surpassing 2 terawatts (TW) just two years after reaching 1 TW, leading players are now embracing
automation, software-driven diagnostics, and robotics to combat operational challenges and ensure long-term cost
competitiveness. By integrating these technologies, industry leaders are  setting the standard for the future of solar energy.
Key trends in this report:
Rising Power Loss: Equipment-driven underperformance resulted in annual losses of $5,720 per MWdc in 2024, up 15% from
2023 and 214% over the past five years. Addressing these inefficiencies is crucial to increasing project returns and continuing
to bolster a newly robust industry.
Labor Shortages and Costs: The industry’s workforce is not growing fast enough to meet the rising demand, with O&M costs
increasing due to wage inflation. To counteract these pressures, top operators are leveraging performance intelligence to
optimize squeezed resources and reduce manual tasks.
Automation and Technology Adoption: The most successful solar asset owners are turning to aerial inspections, remotely
operated robotics, and advanced analytics to pinpoint and resolve critical performance issues efficiently. High-priority defects
account for 90% of revenue loss, making targeted, data-driven maintenance strategies a necessity.
