Recent research highlights the development of automated decision support systems for energy system operators across various industrial applications. These systems aim to optimize energy consumption (Marques et al., 2016), balance electricity grids (Marco Potenziani et al., 2014), and manage renewable energy sources in microgrids (Stamatescu et al., 2017). Advanced visualization techniques and user interfaces are being designed to enhance situational awareness and support operator decision-making in complex power networks (Chen et al., 2017; Zaher et al., 2016; Handschin & Leder, 2001). Automated fault location systems have been implemented to expedite service restoration and improve system reliability (Vasco et al., 2008). The integration of Industry 4.0 concepts, including digitalisation and machine learning models, is being applied to enhance energy efficiency and sustainability in manufacturing processes (Ranade et al., 2024). These developments collectively aim to address the increasing challenges faced by operators in managing highly automated and interconnected energy systems.
