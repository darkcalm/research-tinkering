Field trials of AI-assisted communication protocols in utility operations have shown promising results across various applications. Early trials focused on metering systems for water, gas, and electricity utilities (Newbury, 1996). More recent studies have explored AI deployment in field service operations, identifying critical success factors such as standard protocols and people-centric approaches (Wang et al., 2021). Power line communications have been tested for fault detection in distribution systems (Jee et al., 2005), while high-speed communication-assisted tripping and sectionalizing have improved reliability in networked distribution systems (Turner, 2012). AI and automation have enhanced water distribution network monitoring, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic (Quail, 2020). Quality-of-service considerations in utility communication networks have been examined (Hopkinson et al., 2009), and the first field trial of an LLM-powered AI agent for autonomous driving optical networks has demonstrated efficient wavelength management and fault handling (Liu et al., 2024).
