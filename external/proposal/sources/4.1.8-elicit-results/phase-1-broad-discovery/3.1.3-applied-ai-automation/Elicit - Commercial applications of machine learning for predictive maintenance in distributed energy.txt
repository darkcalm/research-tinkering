Machine learning (ML) techniques are increasingly applied to predictive maintenance (PdM) in energy and industrial sectors, offering proactive solutions to equipment failures and energy efficiency optimization (Diptiben Ghelani, 2024; Cruz & Garcia, 2024). ML algorithms, such as support vector machines, random forests, and neural networks, analyze data from various sources to predict failures and optimize maintenance schedules (Cruz & Garcia, 2024; Agarwal et al., 2024). This approach reduces downtime, enhances energy efficiency, and extends equipment life (Trần et al., 2021). Challenges include data quality, integration of heterogeneous sources, and model interpretability (Diptiben Ghelani, 2024). Solutions involve data preprocessing, feature engineering, and incorporating domain expertise (Diptiben Ghelani, 2024; Liulys, 2019). PdM applications span various industries, including manufacturing, energy infrastructure, and distribution transformers (Alvarez Quiñones et al., 2022; Paolanti et al., 2018). Implementation of ML-based PdM can lead to significant cost savings and improved system reliability (Alvarez Quiñones et al., 2022; Cline et al., 2017).
