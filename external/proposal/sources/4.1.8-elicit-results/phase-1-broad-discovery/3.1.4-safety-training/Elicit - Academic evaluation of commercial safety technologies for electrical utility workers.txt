This collection of papers addresses various aspects of electrical safety for utility workers and construction zones. Several studies focus on implementing safety standards like NFPA 70E and OSHA regulations to mitigate electrical hazards in industrial and commercial settings (Neitzel, 2016; Olsen, 2018; Neitzel, 2011). Researchers emphasize the importance of comprehensive electrical safety programs, including risk assessments, safe work procedures, and proper personal protective equipment (Floyd et al., 2004; Neitzel, 2016). Emerging technologies play a crucial role in enhancing worker safety, with studies exploring wearable monitoring systems for linemen (de Vasconcelos et al., 2022) and intrusion alert technologies for work zones (Abdallah et al., 2024; Awolusi & Marks, 2019). These innovations aim to prevent accidents by providing real-time alerts and monitoring of physiological and environmental parameters. Overall, the literature highlights the ongoing efforts to improve electrical safety through a combination of standardized practices, advanced technologies, and cultural shifts within organizations (Floyd et al., 2003; Olsen, 2018).
