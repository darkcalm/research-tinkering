Human error in maintenance operations is a significant concern across various industries, including power plants and wind farms. Studies have shown that human factors contribute to 40% of wind turbine failures (Keprate et al., 2024). Common causes of maintenance errors include work environment, organizational factors, individual characteristics, and task complexity (Pasquale et al., 2017; Dhillon & Liu, 2006). Maintenance errors can lead to reduced equipment reliability, safety issues, and economic losses (Dhillon, 2014; Alharran et al., 2023). To mitigate these risks, researchers have proposed various approaches, including human reliability analysis methods, performance shape factors, and AI-based recommendation systems (Keprate et al., 2024; Tavakoli & Nafar, 2021). Improving work instructions, providing adequate training, and enhancing safety culture are also recommended (Arini & Mulyono, 2013). While high-risk sectors like nuclear power and aviation have extensively addressed maintenance errors, manufacturing systems require more attention in this area (Pasquale et al., 2017).
