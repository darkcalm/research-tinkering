Research partnerships in occupational health for emerging energy technologies face both challenges and opportunities. Collaborative efforts between academic and non-academic partners can improve research relevance and quality, enhance knowledge translation, and build trust (Haynes et al., 2019). The renewable energy sector may offer health benefits to workers, but further research is needed to address potential hazards (Mulloy et al., 2013; Sumner & Layde, 2009). European collaborations like PEROSH have facilitated knowledge exchange and evidence-based policy-making in occupational safety and health for two decades (Nielsen et al., 2023). Key research areas include chemical and biological hazards in green jobs, particularly in energy supply, waste treatment, construction, and green chemistry (Gravel et al., 2016). Emerging topics encompass the impact of new technologies, telework, and algorithmic management on worker health (Laurent, 2024). Wearable technologies show promise for exposure monitoring in the energy sector (Houghton, 2024). Successful partnerships can lead to significant cost savings and improved workplace health outcomes (Yassi et al., 2004).
