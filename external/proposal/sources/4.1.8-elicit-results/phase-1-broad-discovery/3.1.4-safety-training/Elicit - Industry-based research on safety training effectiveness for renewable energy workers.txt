Safety training is crucial for reducing accidents and injuries in the construction and renewable energy industries (Mulloy et al., 2013; Burke et al., 2006). More engaging training methods, such as behavioral modeling and hands-on practice, are generally more effective than passive methods like lectures (Burke et al., 2006; Nykänen et al., 2020). Virtual reality-based training has shown promise in improving safety competencies and motivation (Nykänen et al., 2020). Factors influencing training effectiveness include project-related aspects, demographics, and organizational elements (Tezel et al., 2021). While training positively impacts attitudes and knowledge, evidence for behavioral change and health outcomes is less robust (Ricci et al., 2016). Special consideration should be given to migrant workers, who face higher risks in the construction sector (Peiró et al., 2020). In multicultural workplaces, a mix of less and more engaging training methods may enhance effectiveness (Goh Pui Teck et al., 2015). Ongoing research is needed to evaluate long-term impacts of safety training on workplace outcomes (Peiró et al., 2020).
