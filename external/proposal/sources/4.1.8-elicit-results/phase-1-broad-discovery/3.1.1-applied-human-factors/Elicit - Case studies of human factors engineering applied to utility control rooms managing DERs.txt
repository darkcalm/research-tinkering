The integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in power systems presents both challenges and opportunities for utilities. Case studies demonstrate that DERs can provide grid services like frequency regulation and voltage control (Hooshyar et al., 2023; Robbins et al., 2011). However, their integration requires new management approaches, including Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems (DERMS) and hierarchical control frameworks (Strezoski et al., 2022; Xia et al., 2019). Utilities face challenges such as poor observability, reverse power flow, and protection system maloperation (Strezoski et al., 2022). Microgrids are emerging as a solution to increase grid resiliency, but their implementation requires careful consideration of control strategies (Vukojevic et al., 2020). Data-driven approaches, like anomaly detection using Empirical Mode Decomposition, can enhance system reliability and optimize energy management in DER-integrated systems (Sarangi et al., 2024). The transition to DER-rich grids necessitates reforms in utility business models and regulatory frameworks (Tabors et al., 2016; Wakefield et al., 2013).
