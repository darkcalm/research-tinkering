Field studies examining human operator challenges in distributed energy resource (DER) operations highlight several key issues. The integration of DERs introduces bidirectional power flow, leading to voltage variations, protection problems, and stability concerns (Akhtar Hussain Javed et al., 2021). Operators face difficulties in coordinating a large number of distributed assets, necessitating innovative approaches like transactive control (Hu et al., 2017). Challenges include managing technical and economic performance across multiple time scales, activating demand-side resources, and promoting resilient operation (Muhanji et al., 2018). The increasing penetration of DERs requires enhanced coordination between transmission and distribution system operators (Birk et al., 2016). Operators must also address issues related to grid congestion, voltage deviations, and balancing needs (Guzmán-Henao et al., 2024). Additionally, the integration of renewable sources, storage systems, and demand response mechanisms presents operational challenges that impact system reliability and stability (Loji et al., 2023; Vartanian et al., 2018; Guerrero et al., 2020).
