Ethnographic studies of communication in power systems reveal complex interactions between organizational structures, human operators, and technology. In nuclear power plants, operators use vague verbal exchanges to maintain awareness and system stability (Carvalho et al., 2007; dos Santos et al., 2006). Communication breakdowns in operating departments can lead to safety risks due to time pressures and deviations from routines (Waring et al., 2013). Power structures in workplaces are reinforced through communication patterns (Weiss & Wu, 2017), while infrastructure studies highlight the importance of examining mundane aspects of information systems (Star, 2002). The Texas power outage of 2021 demonstrated how communication failures can impact critical systems (Wagner et al., 2021). Ethnographic approaches provide valuable insights into how different genres of texts are used to generate and disseminate knowledge in engineering centers (Mackiewicz, 2004). These studies emphasize the need to consider broader organizational factors and inter-departmental relationships when analyzing communication and safety in power system operations.
