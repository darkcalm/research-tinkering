Recent research highlights the occupational safety and health (OSH) challenges in the renewable energy sector, particularly for workers in floating solar photovoltaic (FPV) and wind turbine installations. Workers face risks including ergonomic hazards, heat exposure, electrocution, and psychosocial factors (Sen & Karmakar, 2021; Sen et al., 2021). Wind turbine technicians report high physical demands from climbing, torqueing, and manual materials handling (Fischer et al., 2020). Harness suspension negatively impacts task performance compared to standing or seated positions (Stewart et al., 2020). The need for ergonomic design interventions, improved training, and safety standards is emphasized (Duroha, n.d.; Sen et al., 2021). Despite these challenges, the shift towards renewable energy may offer health benefits to workers through reduced pollution and occupational hazards compared to traditional energy sectors (Mulloy et al., 2013; Gerassis et al., 2018). Further research is needed to address the unique risks in this rapidly growing industry (Pratama et al., 2024).
