The energy efficiency and renewable energy sectors are experiencing rapid growth, driven by factors like volatile energy prices, climate change concerns, and technological advancements (Hardcastle & Waterman-Hoey, 2009). This growth has led to increased demand for a skilled workforce, with employers reporting difficulties in finding qualified candidates (Truitt et al., 2022). To address this challenge, various initiatives focus on workforce development, including university programs (Singh, 2012; Reed & Stanchina, 2010), industry partnerships (Levanthal & Tegen, 2013), and government-funded research (Goldman, 2010). These efforts aim to create a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workforce (Truitt et al., 2022; Gadzanku et al., 2023) capable of meeting the evolving needs of the industry. Key areas of focus include education and training programs (Moe, 2024), skills assessment (Levanthal & Tegen, 2013), and addressing the aging workforce issue (Reed & Stanchina, 2010). Such initiatives are crucial for supporting the growth and sustainability of the energy efficiency and renewable energy sectors.
