Industry-university partnerships are crucial for advancing human-machine interaction in smart grid operations. These collaborations foster research on adaptive autonomy, fuzzy expert systems, and reinforcement learning for energy management (Zamani et al., 2011; Tao et al., 2022). Studies emphasize the importance of data integration, visualization, and real-time monitoring in smart grids (Overholt, 2009; Lodgaard & Dransfeld, 2020). Augmented and virtual reality technologies are emerging as key paradigms for human-machine interaction in Industry 4.0 (Krupitzer et al., 2020). Researchers are also developing game theory models to simulate human-human interactions mediated by control systems, aiming to design attack-resilient grids (Backhaus et al., 2013). These partnerships not only address knowledge gaps in the industry but also strengthen university programs, preparing the next generation of power engineers (Overholt, 2009; Keck & Lee, 2015). Overall, industry-university collaborations are driving innovation in smart grid operations, enhancing system reliability, and improving decision-making processes.
