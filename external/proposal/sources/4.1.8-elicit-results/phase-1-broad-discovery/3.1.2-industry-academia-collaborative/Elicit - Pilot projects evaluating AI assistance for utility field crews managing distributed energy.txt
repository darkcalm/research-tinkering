Recent pilot projects have explored AI and augmented reality applications to enhance utility field operations and grid management. Studies have evaluated assisted reality for maintenance activities (Almeida et al., 2021) and remote assistance for electric power workers (Lodetti et al., 2021). AI solutions are being developed for safety enhancement in field operations (Iaccarino et al., 2023), condition monitoring, and demand-side management in distribution grids (Vögele et al., 2020). Research has focused on AI applications for distributed energy systems planning and operation (Arévalo & Jurado, 2024), as well as accelerating AI deployment on the grid through sensor networks and cloud-based platforms (Murphy et al., 2020). Projects like GridSense have tested decentralized AI for grid resilience (Ulbig et al., 2016). Efforts are also underway to develop AI assistants for power grid operators to help manage increasing complexity (Marot et al., 2020). These initiatives aim to improve efficiency, safety, and decision-making in utility operations as the energy landscape evolves.
