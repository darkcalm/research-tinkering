set measurable goals, track progress, and adjust as needed to ensure that programs are responding appropriately to worker needs. the study then shifts to methods for cultivating the future workforce by effectively engaging with students and young professionals. the construction sector, a vital part of the building industry, has had difficulty appealing to students, in part due to a negative perception of careers in the field. this report describes how the building industry can help shift this perception if it can appeal to millennial and generation z desire for purpose in their careers, connection to lifestyle values, and application of technology in the workplace. in addition, the industry needs to better illustrate to parents, students, teachers, and counselors the different pathways into and through the building industry, all of which can lead to a stable, well-paying career. included in this study are many examples of programs seeing success in workforce engagement and inclusion. these case studies show how equitable and inclusive workforce development activities can broaden the applicant pool by attracting more students and historically underrepresented groups to building industry careers. taken together, these activities will prepare the u.s. workforce to meet the needs of the future built environment, and reduce energy use across the economy.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 7\\n\\nvi this report is available at no cost from the national renewable energy laboratory (nrel) at www.nrel.gov/publications. table of contents 1 introduction and

priorities for the u.s. department of energy (doe) to focus its work: combating climate change, creating clean energy union jobs, promoting equity and diversity in stem within clean energy industries, and promoting energy justice. embedded in these priorities is an acknowledgement that communities of color and low-income communities have borne the brunt of air, water, and soil pollution, and that the clean energy revolution must lift the communities that have been left behind and make sure those who have suffered the most are the first to benefit. this has included launching the justice40 initiative, which is a plan to deliver 40% of the overall benefits of climate investments to disadvantaged communities and inform equitable research, development, and deployment within doe (doe 2022). in support of these goals, doe\u2019s building technologies office (bto) and the national renewable energy laboratory (nrel) recognize that a large and diverse workforce is necessary for achieving the mission to make the united states a global leader in delivering quality energy efficiency and clean energy products to american homes and buildings. bto focuses its workforce development efforts on students and professionals who are vital for designing, constructing, installing, and operating energy-efficient buildings and technologies. this national effort is aimed at creating the jobs needed to build a modern, sustainable infrastructure and to deliver an equitable clean energy future, support workers affected by the energy transition, and ensure no communities are left behind. the purpose of this study is to identify key factors to create successful workforce recruitment and retention programs that help increase diversity and equity within the building energy efficiency industry. these factors can be applied to individual companies, training programs, or broader industry efforts. today, the existing energy efficiency workforce does not fully represent the diversity of the united states. doe, the national association of state energy officials (naseo), and the energy futures initiative (efi) have been publishing data on the energy efficiency workforce since 2016 in the u.s. energy and employment report (useer). according to the useer, after several years of job growth, energy efficiency employment1 contracted by more than 11% in 2020 to 2.1 million workers across a range of professions in construction, manufacturing, wholesale trade, professional, and other services. this was almost entirely a result of covid-19 challenges, and employers were also optimistic that these losses would be largely erased in 2021 (naseo and efi 2021). these job losses disproportionately impacted hispanic and latino workers (e2 et al. 2020). exacerbating the workforce shortage is hiring difficulty experienced by a large majority of energy efficiency employers. the 2021 useer found that a majority of energy efficiency employers had difficulty finding qualified candidates because of a lack of technical skills, small 1 the energy efficiency workforce is defined as \u201cemployment [that] covers both the production and installation of energy-saving products and the provision of services that reduce end-use energy consumption\u201d (naseo and efi 2021). the useer energy efficiency employment figure does not include direct employees of utility companies who supervise, design, or implement utility energy efficiency programs. these workers are counted as utility employees in the 2021 useer.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 10\\n\\n2 this report is available at no cost from the national renewable energy laboratory (nrel) at www.nrel.gov/publications. applicant pool, and lack of industry-specific knowledge (naseo and efi 2021). industry and organizational workforce development activities can help address these areas by designing opportunities that broaden the applicant pool by attracting more students and historically underrepresented groups to building efficiency careers, and linking them to resources to improve their skills and industry knowledge. the scope of energy, climate, and technology challenges the country faces will require the talents of all americans, including those who have been underrepresented or disproportionately impacted by covid-19. employing strategies to attract a diverse workforce is especially important in sectors that are positioned to have a dramatic shift in the use of technology or that otherwise face a significant transition because diverse perspectives provide the benefit of challenging conventional thinking and developing innovative approaches. many new technologies, program designs, and business models are poised to re-innovate the efficiency sector, including robots that perform high-risk or repetitive tasks on construction sites, digital building twins to aid in building design, and augmented and virtual reality to streamline project planning (deloitte 2020). studies have found that a more diverse workforce also delivers measurable benefits. the body of evidence supporting the correlation between the diversity of a company\u2019s workforce and its financial performance is well established. mckinsey and company\u2019s 2015 \u201cdiversity matters\u201d report found a statistically significant correlation between gender and ethnic diversity and company performance. mckinsey identifies the most important drivers as (1) advantages in recruiting the best talent, (2) stronger customer orientation, (3) increased employee satisfaction, and (4) improved decision-making (hunt et al. 2015). likewise, the report notes that companies in the top quartile for women leaders are 15% more likely to have above average financial returns. this correlation suggests that companies/industries are more successful when they are committed to diverse leadership. gender diversity in the energy sector workforce is essential to promote more innovative and inclusive solutions that can help make clean energy accessible to the entire population (iea 2020). additionally, racial and ethnic minorities are expected to make up more than half of the u.s. population by midcentury, with millennials and generation z2 accounting for 44% and 48% of this population, respectively (frey 2018). the development of strategies that attract top talent from diverse gender and ethnic groups will necessitate an emphasis on equity, inclusion, and belonging as the demographics of the workforce shift. redefining what \u201cthe best and the brightest\u201d means via a diversity and inclusionary lens is necessary to create a company culture accepting of innovative solutions from diverse perspectives. the addition of gender diversity, racial and ethnic minorities, millennials, and generation z within the demographics of the building efficiency workforce helps ensure that the best and the brightest employees are hired, thereby strengthening american innovation and competitiveness in the sector for decades to come. steps taken now to increase the diversity of the efficiency workforce and provide good 2 generation z includes people born after 1996, millennials were born between 1980 and 1995, according to https://www.kasasa.com/articles/generations/gen-x-gen-y-gen-z.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 11\\n\\n3 this report is available at no cost from the national renewable energy laboratory (nrel) at www.nrel.gov/publications. wages, benefits, and worker protections will ensure that companies cultivate loyal employees and have a strong financial foundation. many businesses, nonprofits, training organizations, labor organizations, and government agencies have been working to address diversity and equity gaps in the workforce. this paper identifies many examples\u2014but is by no means exhaustive\u2014to help contribute to our collective understanding and support replication of successful models. 1.1 scope and definitions this study reviews programs, processes, and general approaches to workforce development that create equitable and inclusive work environments, and successfully attract and retain workers in the building and energy efficiency industries. for the purposes of this report, the national renewable energy laboratory (nrel) defines \u201cbuilding energy efficiency careers\u201d as those careers critical to the expansion of high-performance buildings, including research and manufacturing, architecture, construction and engineering, facilities management, energy ratings, and real estate professionals. energy efficiency and building energy efficiency are used interchangeably throughout this report. 1.2 report organization this paper begins with a brief overview of diversity statistics for the energy efficiency workforce and workforce diversity programs, discusses student interest in these careers, and concludes with a discussion of workforce diversity best practices. additional workforce programs reviewed for this study are described in appendix a. 1.3 limitations defining and tracking the building efficiency workforce is challenging because energy efficiency is often part, but not all, of a person\u2019s job. this study is therefore structurally limited by the lack of data available to measure the energy efficiency workforce. in fact, there are no naics codes in the u.s. department of labor\u2019s industry classification system to identify efficiency careers; thus, the bureau of labor statistics (bls) does not track or report on the workforce in the efficient building technologies sector. to fill this void, the office of energy efficiency and renewable energy within doe commissioned the first useer, published in 2016. useer provides year-over-year statistics on \u201cenergy efficiency\u201d careers. diversity data measured in the 2021 useer and bls include gender, age, race/ethnicity, and veteran status. while the useer provides some insight into the state of diversity within the energy efficiency sector, many elements were not measured in this survey, including socioeconomic factors, or participation by the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (lgbtq+) community or other groups, such as formerly incarcerated individuals. because more than half of those considered to be \u201cenergy efficiency employees\u201d in the useer work in the construction industry, diversity data from the broader construction industry are used to fill in some of the data gaps in the first section. currently available data on diversity in the efficiency workforce do not provide a comprehensive or granular enough view to fully understand diversity within the building efficiency sector. for instance, data are lacking on wage rates or occupations within the energy efficiency sector for\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 12\\n\\n4 this report is available at no cost from the national renewable energy laboratory (nrel) at www.nrel.gov/publications. various demographic groups. additional data gathering techniques that allow for greater segmentation and cross analysis will help us better understand the state of diversity within this workforce. 2 diversity within the efficiency workforce demographics measured in the useer show that women and black or african american workers are notably underrepresented in the building energy efficiency sector when compared with their representation in the national workforce averages (naseo and efi 2021). table 1. energy efficiency workforce demographics (q4, 2020) source: 2021 useer beyond this imbalance in the energy efficiency sector broadly, the demographics can be even more divergent for specific careers within the workforce. for example, although women account for 48% of the total u.s. workforce, they make up less than 2% of the heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (hvac) workforce (electric & gas industries association 2018). a review of 2020 bls data, illustrated in figure 1, shows that key professions in the building energy efficiency industry, namely architecture, engineering, and construction, are predominately white men. for comparison, while managers in energy efficiency fields follow this trend, management professionals overall have an almost balanced gender split and approximately double the minority representation, consistent with their representation in the working-age population overall (bls 2020).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 13\\n\\n5 this report is available at no cost from the national renewable energy laboratory (nrel) at www.nrel.gov/publications. figure 1. demographics of key energy efficiency professions by job type source: data from bls 2020 according to mckinsey & company, \u201cthe construction industry historically has a poor record of achieving gender parity in its workforce. the shift from manual labor, which is typically male-dominated, to new technology-enabled ways of working could mean increased interest from women. construction needs to diversify its sources of talent to attract the best people, and higher female participation is a large opportunity\u201d (barbosa et al. 2017). 2.1 workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion

interaction institute for social change, equity (e.g., seeing the game in figure 2) is not achieved by simply giving each individual an equal block to stand on. similarly, workplaces cannot achieve equity without considering what each population (e.g., minority, majority, and underserved) may need to be successful in the workplace. the concept of inclusion takes this a step farther, actively cultivating an environment that promotes direct participation and a sense of belonging. understanding the range of different populations\u2019 needs and providing services that support their success is essential for creating an equitable and inclusive workforce. unlike the people in the cartoon, who are \u201cunequal\u201d because of an intrinsic personal feature (their height), workplace inequity is often a condition resulting from many years of unconscious bias3 imposed on historically disadvantaged groups. addressing unconscious bias requires a holistic approach within a workplace and cannot be overcome by simply offering diversity training. a review of organizational practices surrounding recruitment, hiring, employee development, company culture, promotions, and retention are needed to address biases among employees, managers, and organizational systems. the first step in addressing workforce diversity leading to equitable inclusion is to work with your human resources department to analyze underrepresentation. 3 the kirwan institute for the study of race and ethnicity defines unconscious bias as attitudes or stereotypes that impact our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner such that self-reflection does not reveal them.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 15\\n\\n7 this report is available at no cost from the national renewable energy laboratory (nrel) at www.nrel.gov/publications. designing successful workforce diversity programs requires a holistic approach that includes both employees and employers. the many programs reviewed for this paper, described in section 2.2 and appendix a, have uncovered common practices for designing and implementing successful workforce inclusion programs. 2.2 workforce development programs for underrepresented groups the following workforce programs illustrate many of the key factors for success described in section 2.3 of this paper. the highlighted programs are not an exhaustive list of available programs but represent a subset of the workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion programs studied for this paper. additional programs reviewed are included in appendix a. community hub for opportunities in construction employment in march 2019, north america\u2019s building trades unions (nabtu) partnered with the community hub for opportunities in construction employment and the baltimore black worker union center to produce an event titled, \u201cfrom girls in the hood to women in construction.\u201d approximately 50 attendees were encouraged to consider careers in the construction trades by attending panel sessions with black women with careers in the construction industry, meeting with recruiters, and networking with the local trade union. the community hub for opportunities in construction employment is an initiative launched by the clinton global foundation with nabtu in 2014. it included a five-year commitment by nabtu to increase diversity within the construction trades. environmental leadership program roger arliner young diversity fellowship program the environmental leadership program (elp) runs the roger arliner young diversity fellowship program to address the challenges of college graduates from diverse backgrounds gaining employment in the clean energy field (environmental leadership program n.d.). the diversity fellowship program offers a two-year paid fellowship for recent college graduates from diverse backgrounds to work with clean energy nonprofit organizations. elp recruits employers and assists them in developing inclusive job descriptions and screening fellowship applicants. elp works with employers prior to hiring fellows to address issues that employees may face, including microaggressions, imposter syndrome, and unconscious bias. elp helps employers create safe spaces to address these diversity and inclusion issues within the organization. all fellows are employed in full-time, living-wage positions with benefits (paid for by the employer) and receive a $1,000 stipend for professional development (paid for by elp). elp also provides monthly coaching and access to elp\u2019s mentorship network. a typical cohort consists of 10\u201312 fellows. a major barrier preventing the program from expanding is the time and effort required to develop relationships with employers willing and able to participate in the program (king 2020). kentucky housing corporation as part of the federal weatherization assistance program (wap), local agencies (subgrantees) are required to have all weatherized homes inspected by a quality control inspector (qci) certified by the building performance institute. in late 2017, kentucky had 23 subgrantees implementing wap, 7 of which did not have a qci on staff, with a single qci contractor attempting to serve 6 of those agencies. qci certification requires energy auditor certification, in\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 16\\n\\n8 this report is available at no cost from the national renewable energy laboratory (nrel) at www.nrel.gov/publications. addition to taking qci training and passing a test. the kentucky housing corporation (khc), which manages wap at the state level, received feedback from multiple interested individuals who reported barriers to participation in training, which included the cost of the training, lost wages during the 11 weeks of training, and costs of travel to attend the training. to address the shortage of qcis and anticipated retirements from existing qcis, khc aimed to recruit, train, and upskill new qcis from outside the wap network. khc secured a $49,000 grant from the kentucky energy and environment cabinet to support the training of four new qcis. to address the identified barriers, khc covered the cost of training, provided a $15 per hour stipend for each week spent in training, and covered the cost of travel for students within 50 miles of the training site or the cost of lodging and per diem for students more than 50 miles from the training site (mccord 2020). additionally, if an employer was willing to commit to employing a new qci to work on wap jobs for two years, khc paid the stipend to the employer to offset the cost of keeping employees fully employed during the training. the qci training was scheduled to be completed in spring 2020, but the pandemic delayed the final week of training and subsequent testing. massachusetts clean energy center clean energy internship program the massachusetts clean energy center (masscec) clean energy internship program is a utility-rate-payer-funded program that addresses the challenges faced by students who cannot afford to take unpaid internships. masscec is not involved in the selection of interns, but rather facilitates the connection between prospective interns and employers and reimburses the host company up to $7,600 per student (massachusetts clean energy center 2020a). after the program was first launched in 2011, masscec recognized that the majority of the initial cohorts were largely white males from private universities and therefore took a two- pronged approach to increase the diversity of the program (jacques 2020). first, they increased the number of interns a company could hire through the program from two to three, if the third student came from a community college. second, masscec targeted recruitment efforts at public schools and community colleges. these efforts have proven effective, with 42% of the current cohort of interns composed of women or minority students. since its inception, the program has placed over 3,600 interns at nearly 470 companies, with 784 interns receiving offers for full-time or part-time employment at their host company following the internship (massachusetts clean energy center 2020a). building on the success of the clean energy internship program, masscec also launched the vocational internship program to help place students (rising juniors and seniors) from vocational high schools in paid clean energy internships during the academic year (massachusetts clean energy center 2020b). new york state energy research and development authority on-the-job training for energy efficiency and clean technology the new york state energy research and development authority\u2019s (nyserda\u2019s) $14 million on-the-job training (ojt) for energy efficiency and clean technology program provides wage subsidies to eligible businesses to help reduce the financial risk of hiring and training new workers (nyserda 2020). in partnership with the new york state department of labor, the program pays employers half of the wages for a new hire up to $16 per hour, with a cap of\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 17\\n\\n9 this report is available at no cost from the national renewable energy laboratory (nrel) at www.nrel.gov/publications. $100,000 per employer. the wage payment is for four months for new hires who are not included in nyserda\u2019s priority populations, and for six months if the new hire is from one of the following priority populations: veterans, native americans, individuals with disabilities, low-income individuals, unemployed power plant workers, previously incarcerated individuals, youth participating in designated work preparedness programs, and residents in designated environmental justice communities. the new york state department of labor assists participating businesses in developing ojt training plans and in assessing skills necessary for a position and identifying potential interviewees. as of may 2020, approximately 26% of the new hires in the ojt program were from these priority populations, and since the beginning of 2019, approximately 80% of all new hires were retained by employers following the wage subsidy period (ferranti 2020). by lowering the financial risk to train new employees, the ojt program creates an additional incentive for employers to diversify their hiring and provide opportunity for nontraditional workers. the build out alliance promotes equity in the workplace for lgbtq professionals in the building design and construction industries the build out

      "data on the energy efficiency workforce since 2016 in the u.s. energy and employment report (useer). according to the useer, after several years of job growth, energy efficiency employment1 contracted by more than 11% in 2020 to 2.1 million workers across a range of professions in construction, manufacturing, wholesale trade, professional, and other services. this was almost entirely a result of covid-19 challenges, and employers were also optimistic that these losses would be largely erased in 2021 (naseo and efi 2021). these job losses disproportionately impacted hispanic and latino workers (e2 et al. 2020). exacerbating the workforce shortage is hiring difficulty experienced by a large majority of energy efficiency employers. the 2021 useer found that a majority of energy efficiency employers had difficulty finding qualified candidates because of a lack of technical skills, small 1 the energy efficiency workforce is defined as \u201cemployment [that] covers both the production and installation of energy-saving products and the provision of services that reduce end-use energy consumption\u201d (naseo and efi 2021). the useer energy efficiency employment figure does not include direct employees of utility companies who supervise, design, or implement utility energy efficiency programs. these workers are counted as utility employees in the 2021 useer.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 10\\n\\n2 this report is available at no cost from the national renewable energy laboratory (nrel) at www.nrel.gov/publications. applicant pool, and lack of industry-specific knowledge (naseo and efi 2021). industry and organizational workforce development activities can help address these areas by designing opportunities that broaden the applicant pool by attracting more students and historically underrepresented groups to building efficiency careers, and linking them to resources to improve their skills and industry knowledge. the scope of energy, climate, and technology challenges the country faces will require the talents of all americans, including those who have been underrepresented or disproportionately impacted by covid-19. employing strategies to attract a diverse workforce is especially important in sectors that are positioned to have a dramatic shift in the use of technology or that otherwise face a significant transition because diverse perspectives provide the benefit of challenging conventional thinking and developing innovative approaches. many new technologies, program designs, and business models are poised to re-innovate the efficiency sector, including robots that perform high-risk or repetitive tasks on construction sites, digital building twins to aid in building design, and augmented and virtual reality to streamline project planning (deloitte 2020). studies have found that a more diverse workforce also delivers measurable benefits. the body of evidence supporting the correlation between the diversity of a company\u2019s workforce and its financial performance is well established. mckinsey and company\u2019s 2015 \u201cdiversity matters\u201d report found a statistically significant correlation between gender and ethnic diversity and company performance. mckinsey identifies the most important drivers as (1) advantages in recruiting the best talent, (2) stronger customer orientation, (3) increased employee satisfaction, and (4) improved decision-making (hunt et al. 2015). likewise, the report notes that companies in the top quartile for women leaders are 15% more likely to have above average financial returns. this correlation suggests that companies/industries are more successful when they are committed to diverse leadership. gender diversity in the energy sector workforce is essential to promote more innovative and inclusive solutions that can help make clean energy accessible to the entire population (iea 2020). additionally, racial and ethnic minorities are expected to make up more than half of the u.s. population by midcentury, with millennials and generation z2 accounting for 44% and 48% of this population, respectively (frey 2018). the development of strategies that attract top talent from diverse gender and ethnic groups will necessitate an emphasis on equity, inclusion, and belonging as the demographics of the workforce shift. redefining what \u201cthe best and the brightest\u201d means via a diversity and inclusionary lens is necessary to create a company culture accepting of innovative solutions from diverse perspectives. the addition of gender diversity, racial and ethnic minorities, millennials, and generation z within the demographics of the building efficiency workforce helps ensure that the best and the brightest employees are hired, thereby strengthening american innovation and competitiveness in the sector for decades to come. steps taken now to increase the diversity of the efficiency workforce and provide good 2 generation z includes people born after 1996, millennials were born between 1980 and 1995, according to https://www.kasasa.com/articles/generations/gen-x-gen-y-gen-z.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page

cultivate loyal employees and have a strong financial foundation. many businesses, nonprofits, training organizations, labor organizations, and government agencies have been working to address diversity and equity gaps in the workforce. this paper identifies many examples\u2014but is by no means exhaustive\u2014to help contribute to our collective understanding and support replication of successful models. 1.1 scope and definitions this study reviews programs, processes, and general approaches to workforce development that create equitable and inclusive work environments, and successfully attract and retain workers in the building and energy efficiency industries. for the purposes of this report, the national renewable energy laboratory (nrel) defines \u201cbuilding energy efficiency careers\u201d as those careers critical to the expansion of high-performance buildings, including research and manufacturing, architecture, construction and engineering, facilities management, energy ratings, and real estate professionals. energy efficiency and building energy efficiency are used interchangeably throughout this report. 1.2 report organization this paper begins with a brief overview of diversity statistics for the energy efficiency workforce and workforce diversity programs, discusses student interest in these careers, and concludes with a discussion of workforce diversity best practices. additional workforce programs reviewed for this study are described in appendix a. 1.3 limitations defining and tracking the building efficiency workforce is challenging because energy efficiency is often part, but not all, of a person\u2019s job. this study is therefore structurally limited by the lack of data available to measure the energy efficiency workforce. in fact, there are no naics codes in the u.s. department of labor\u2019s industry classification system to identify efficiency careers; thus, the bureau of labor statistics (bls) does not track or report on the workforce in the efficient building technologies sector. to fill this void, the office of energy efficiency and renewable energy within doe commissioned the first useer, published in 2016. useer provides year-over-year statistics on \u201cenergy efficiency\u201d careers. diversity data measured in the 2021 useer and bls include gender, age, race/ethnicity, and veteran status. while the useer provides some insight into the state of diversity within the energy efficiency sector, many elements were not measured in this survey, including socioeconomic factors, or participation by the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (lgbtq+) community or other groups, such as formerly incarcerated individuals. because more than half of those considered to be \u201cenergy efficiency employees\u201d in the useer work in the construction industry, diversity data from the broader construction industry are used to fill in some of the data gaps in the first section. currently available data on diversity in the efficiency workforce do not provide a comprehensive or granular enough view to fully understand diversity within the building efficiency sector. for instance, data are lacking on wage rates or occupations within the energy efficiency sector for\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 12\\n\\n4 this report is available at no cost from the national renewable energy laboratory (nrel) at www.nrel.gov/publications. various demographic groups. additional data gathering techniques that allow for greater segmentation and cross analysis will help us better understand the state of diversity within this workforce. 2 diversity within the efficiency workforce demographics measured in the useer show that women and black or african american workers are notably underrepresented in the building energy efficiency sector when compared with their representation in the national workforce averages (naseo and efi 2021). table 1. energy efficiency workforce demographics (q4, 2020) source: 2021 useer beyond this imbalance in the energy efficiency sector broadly, the demographics can be even more divergent for specific careers within the workforce. for example, although women account for 48% of the total u.s. workforce, they make up less than 2% of the heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (hvac) workforce (electric & gas industries association 2018). a review of 2020 bls data, illustrated in figure 1, shows that key professions in the building energy efficiency industry, namely architecture, engineering, and construction, are predominately white men. for comparison, while managers in energy efficiency fields follow this trend, management professionals overall have an almost balanced gender split and approximately double the minority representation, consistent with their representation in the working-age population overall (bls 2020).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 13\\n\\n5 this report is available at no cost from the national renewable energy laboratory (nrel) at www.nrel.gov/publications. figure 1. demographics of key energy efficiency professions by job type source: data from bls 2020 according to mckinsey & company, \u201cthe construction industry historically has a poor record of achieving gender parity in its workforce. the shift from manual labor, which is typically male-dominated, to new technology-enabled ways of working could mean increased interest from women. construction needs to diversify its sources of talent to attract the best people, and higher female participation is a large opportunity\u201d (barbosa et al. 2017). 2.1 workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion overview the interaction institute for social change published a cartoon in 2016 that illustrates a central point in many

for social change. artist: angus maguire. according to the interaction institute for social change, equity (e.g., seeing the game in figure 2) is not achieved by simply giving each individual an equal block to stand on. similarly, workplaces cannot achieve equity without considering what each population (e.g., minority, majority, and underserved) may need to be successful in the workplace. the concept of inclusion takes this a step farther, actively cultivating an environment that promotes direct participation and a sense of belonging. understanding the range of different populations\u2019 needs and providing services that support their success is essential for creating an equitable and inclusive workforce. unlike the people in the cartoon, who are \u201cunequal\u201d because of an intrinsic personal feature (their height), workplace inequity is often a condition resulting from many years of unconscious bias3 imposed on historically disadvantaged groups. addressing unconscious bias requires a holistic approach within a workplace and cannot be overcome by simply offering diversity training. a review of organizational practices surrounding recruitment, hiring, employee development, company culture, promotions, and retention are needed to address biases among employees, managers, and organizational systems. the first step in addressing workforce diversity leading to equitable inclusion is to work with your human resources department to analyze underrepresentation. 3 the kirwan institute for the study of race and ethnicity defines unconscious bias as attitudes or stereotypes that impact our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner such that self-reflection does not reveal them.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 15\\n\\n7 this report is available at

and employers. the many programs reviewed for this paper, described in section 2.2 and appendix a, have uncovered common practices for designing and implementing successful workforce inclusion programs. 2.2 workforce development programs for underrepresented groups the following workforce programs illustrate many of the key factors for success described in section 2.3 of this paper. the highlighted programs are not an exhaustive list of available programs but represent a subset of the workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion programs studied for this paper. additional programs reviewed are included in appendix a. community hub for opportunities in construction employment in march 2019, north america\u2019s building trades unions (nabtu) partnered with the community hub for opportunities in construction employment and the baltimore black worker union center to produce an event titled, \u201cfrom girls in the hood to women in construction.\u201d approximately 50 attendees were encouraged to consider careers in the construction trades by attending panel sessions with black women with careers in the construction industry, meeting with recruiters, and networking with the local trade union. the community hub for opportunities in construction employment is an initiative launched by the clinton global foundation with nabtu in 2014. it included a five-year commitment by nabtu to increase diversity within the construction trades. environmental leadership program roger arliner young diversity fellowship program the environmental leadership program (elp) runs the roger arliner young diversity fellowship program to address the challenges of college graduates from diverse backgrounds gaining employment in the clean energy field (environmental leadership program n.d.). the diversity fellowship program offers a two-year paid fellowship for recent college graduates from diverse backgrounds to work with clean energy nonprofit organizations. elp recruits employers and assists them in developing inclusive job descriptions and screening fellowship applicants. elp works with employers prior to hiring fellows to address issues that employees may face, including microaggressions, imposter syndrome, and unconscious bias. elp helps employers create safe spaces to address these diversity and inclusion issues within the organization. all fellows are employed in full-time, living-wage positions with benefits (paid for by the employer) and receive a $1,000 stipend for professional development (paid for by elp). elp also provides monthly coaching and access to elp\u2019s mentorship network. a typical cohort consists of 10\u201312 fellows. a major barrier preventing the program from expanding is the time and effort required to develop relationships with employers willing and able to participate in the program (king 2020). kentucky housing corporation as part of the federal weatherization assistance program (wap), local agencies (subgrantees) are required to have all weatherized homes inspected by a quality",
      "database that lists hundreds of pre-k through 12th grade educational materials about agriculture. joint science and technology institute the joint science and technology institute, provided through the oak ridge institute for science and education, is a fully funded, two-week residential program for middle and high school students and teachers that includes hands-on experiments with u.s. department of defense (dod) researchers in dod schools around the world. the purpose of the program is to expose students and teachers to science, technology, engineering, and math (stem) careers and increase stem competencies. in 2019, the program educated 35 high school students, 32 middle school students, and 8 teachers from the united states, germany, and south korea. mead energy academy the mead energy academy in longmont, colorado, is a program that allows high school students to focus on energy-related topics while earning their high school diploma. the academy serves students whose career interests are related to the energy field (such as engineering or welding) and those interested in fields that support the energy industry (such as law or marketing). the academy is open to all students and prepares them for careers in the energy field, whether they plan to attend a trade school, earn a four-year college degree, or immediately join the workforce. cross-curricular courses in math, science, social studies, language arts, business, and more are taught with an energy focus. frankford high school bright solar futures academy frankford high school in philadelphia, pennsylvania, serves a student body with 91% racial minorities, where 99% of students are eligible for free lunch (frankford high school 2020). in 2018, frankford high school established the bright solar futures academy, which is a first-in- the nation high school career and technical education solar program (frankford high school 2020). in addition to training students in solar installation, the three-year curriculum for high school students also covers energy efficiency technologies, electricity, and construction basics. the program includes hands-on experience with equipment and paid summer internships in the new frankford solar laboratory. the program was in part funded by a $1.25 million grant from the u.s. department of energy\u2019s solar energy technologies office, as well as from peco, the local utility, which contributed funding for the construction of the new solar laboratory at frankford high school (philadelphia energy authority n.d.). the project team developed a list of solar competencies needed for graduation, approved by a local solar industry occupational advisory committee. although initially envisioned to focus on solar technologies, the program has expanded to include energy efficiency, which provides additional career pathways beyond solar installation. the program was motivated in part to develop the workforce to meet the\\n\\n---\\n\\n###

philly effort (philadelphia sun 2019). build your future build your future aims to catalyze recruiting the next generation of craft professionals. one of their signature programs, power up loud, is aimed at getting young women interested in construction careers using game-like technology. in addition to traditional training, participants experience the construction industry via simulators and virtual reality headsets that mimic some of today\u2019s most popular video games. block kids building competition the block kids building competition is a national competition sponsored at the local level by national association of women in construction chapters and other organizations. the competition, open to elementary children in grades k\u20136, introduces children to the construction industry to help create awareness and promote careers in the industry. the competition involves the construction of various structures with interlocking blocks and three of the following additional items: a small rock, string, foil, and poster board. minecraft lesson plans for teachers minecraft lesson plans for teachers, developed by mojang studios and xbox game studios, is an educational program for teaching a range of topics through minecraft, including science and math, along with a database of 500 lesson plans focused on renewable energy and resourcefulness in stem curricula. developed by disco learning media, these lesson plans are aligned with state educational standards in multiple states and help teachers build challenges for students to complete. educators can adapt and edit lessons after the first year of experience with minecraft education edition, providing the opportunity to deepen the lessons and refine their students\u2019 learning experience. tech kids unlimited tech kids unlimited is a not-for-profit educational organization focused on kids with special needs. the organization teaches project-based workshops on coding, game design, video editing, animation, and 3d printing. the programming for teens includes introductory coding and computer skills. an independent evaluation showed advancements in technology and work-based skills as well as in social/emotional learning. tech kids unlimited reports that positive results were most pronounced in improved self-esteem, self-advocacy, technology skills, and digital literacy. parents and counselors reported that 77% of youth participants indicated significant gains in technology skills after one week, and 73% of parents believed their child gained skills to help secure future employment. 3.4 key success factors in student engagement programs attracting more students to building energy efficiency careers can be achieved by cultivating interest while children are in primary and secondary school and exposing them to the variety of pathways into and through the industry. while there is no prescriptive path for how one might enter the energy efficiency workforce, there are distinct educational pathways and requirements for different professions within the building energy efficiency sector, shown in table 3.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 29\\n\\n21 this report is available at no cost from the national renewable energy laboratory (nrel) at www.nrel.gov/publications. table 3. building energy efficiency career paths category careers/job functions educational pathway building trades builders, construction laborers, specialty trades, equipment installation, and maintenance workers vocational programs, apprenticeship programs professional services architecture, design, engineering, real estate professionals, building operators, and managers higher education and/or professional certifications understanding that any pathway into the building efficiency sector can lead to a stable, well- paying career is vital for parents, students, teachers, and counselors. the national association of homebuilders reported that median wages in construction grew more than national median wages in 2018 (3.2% versus 2.5%, respectively), with even larger increases for specific laborers and helpers, ranging from 6.7% for roofing helpers to 3.6% for construction laborers (nahb 2018). in addition, the bureau of labor statistics expects construction jobs to continue to grow 0.4% annually from 2019 to 2029, although at a slower rate than the pre-pandemic 10-year forecast of 1.1% annual growth (bls 2018, 2019). many of the careers shown in table 3 require a strong foundation in stem subjects and pay higher than average wages, according to a pew research study conducted in 2017 (kennedy, hefferon, and funk 2018). however, even with the promise of higher wages, many students are not pursuing stem degrees. the 2017 study indicates that students believe that stem subjects are not useful for their careers (23%), or they think these subjects are too boring (12%) to pursue as a course of study (kennedy, hefferon, and funk 2018). some parents augment their children\u2019s in-school exposure to stem by engaging in after-school programs. outside the classroom, stem programs reach approximately 11 million students nationwide each year, according to the national institute for stem education (nise 2019). an extensive internet search showed many options for after-school stem programs that focus on robotics and computer coding, but very few with a focus on construction or building sciences. one notable exception is the block kids building competition, described in section 3.3. infusing building industry skills into informal and after-school stem programs may help increase awareness and engagement with stem and building efficiency careers. 3.4.1 engage students in stem early and connect stem to building efficiency careers a 2018 center for childhood creativity study found that experiences from infancy through third grade form the foundation for development of one\u2019s critical thinking skills, including curiosity and inquiry, skepticism and questioning, and assessment and analysis\u2014all vital skills for success in stem careers (hadani and rood 2018). therefore, activities that support development of skills for stem careers should be included in primary education. keeping students engaged in stem activities is important throughout middle and high school to encourage their continued interest in stem in college. a 2006 literature review conducted by itest learning research center identified key success factors for any program designed to\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 30\\n\\n22 this report is available at no cost from the national renewable energy laboratory (nrel) at www.nrel.gov/publications. encourage the pursuit of stem degree programs. the research indicated that for students to pursue stem careers, they must: \u2022 be prepared and confident in their abilities to meet the demands of stem degree programs \u2022 identify a tangible stem career that resonates with them \u2022 have sufficient access to education and support within their family and peer networks \u2022 experience motivation and interest in, and enjoyment of stem topics (dorsen, carlson, and goodyear 2006). stem subjects are foundational to many trades involved in the building industry. for example, insulators and hvac technicians should understand thermodynamics, pipefitters and welders should understand pressure dynamics, and technology such as computer-aided design and building information modeling are becoming increasingly common in construction projects. organizations such as build your future provide information and classroom resources to educate students, teachers, and parents about careers in construction. 3.4.2 engage school counselors and teachers to promote benefits of a building efficiency career a study published in the professional counselor indicates that students begin developing career awareness in primary school, explore various careers pathways during middle school, and engage in career preparation and planning in high school (sanders, welfare, and culver 2017). teachers and school counselors are influential in guiding students on career opportunities and pathways, but they need information and support from industry to do so. in fact, 9 out of 10 school counselors surveyed at the american school counselor association conference held virtually in july 2020 indicated they do not have sufficient materials to expose students to building energy efficiency careers (nrel 2020). presentations by professionals in the field followed by social media were reported to be the most effective pathways for engaging students. salary information followed by videos describing and showing the profession were cited as the most compelling information for students to receive about an industry (nrel 2020). 3.4.3 connect energy efficiency to digital and gaming skills of children and young adults efforts to teach children about energy efficiency through digital tools and gaming continue to evolve. multiple projects funded by the european union have resulted in games and interactive online tools that aim to make changes in consumer behavior as easy as possible. research by wright and weidman in 2018 demonstrated that students who showed the most significant interest and understanding of construction were those who did not have parents working in construction industries, and who had more interest in digital hobbies (e.g., video games). the overwhelming theme from researchers\u2019 interviews with students was that the students had not considered that their digital interests would be of value in the construction industry, or that the skills they had in designing 3d models would be useful (wright and weidman 2018).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 31\\n\\n23 this report is available at no cost from the national renewable energy laboratory (nrel) at www.nrel.gov/publications. 3.4.4 consider internships as a valuable component of construction management education the national center for construction education and research emphasizes the benefits of an internship for construction management students. a 2020 blog posted on the organization\u2019s website states that the ideal internship program helps students learn how to work in a team environment while gaining knowledge of the craft. in addition, internships can help students learn to take initiative, communicate effectively, and learn practical skills such as cost-estimating and time management. construction management internships should benefit the company and the intern, allowing each party to determine whether there is a good fit for future employment (johanasen 2020). 3.4.5 appeal to millennial and generation z values a gallup poll and report titled \u201chow millennials want to live\u201d indicates that millennials emphasize purpose over a paycheck (gallup 2019). in other words, millennials must find meaning in their work, and the organizations they choose to work for must have a compelling mission and purpose. as was described in the previous section, appealing to younger generations\u2019 values surrounding climate change, sustainability, and job security by promoting the energy efficiency savings of high-performance buildings and illustrating how the construction sector continued during the covid-19 pandemic will help attract students to building energy efficiency careers. 4 conclusion the building energy efficiency sector has an opportunity to expand its labor force by intentionally recruiting from a more diverse pool of applicants that match the demographics of the nation. successful recruitment of diverse populations must be followed with thoughtful retention policies that support the needs of various populations. actively pursuing diversity, equity, and inclusion in workforce programs and policies can grow the building energy efficiency, sector, support local communities, and improve the lives of underserved americans. communities, employers, education and training organizations, and others can use the processes and best practices described in this report to develop organizational strategies to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion within their spheres of influence. a national effort aimed recruiting and retaining diverse and historically underserved populations for building energy efficiency careers will enable the united states to build a modern, sustainable infrastructure while simultaneously delivering an equitable clean energy transition, ensuring no communities are left behind.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 32\\n\\n24 this report is available at

additional examples of the types of efforts currently being implemented around the country. this is not intended to provide a comprehensive survey of workforce diversity efforts, but rather to showcase a sample of effective programs. the individual workforce diversity programs featured below may focus on one or several underrepresented populations. while there are differences in engaging each of these communities, many of the approaches used by successful workforce diversity programs are applicable across populations. programs are arranged in alphabetical order by title. california public utilities commission general order 156 in 2014, the institute for research on labor and employment at the university of california berkeley conducted a study of workforce issues for california investor-owned utilities, which included a summary of utility and public policies that promote workforce inclusion in the energy efficiency sector (zabin et al. 2014). the following examples demonstrate some of the models for increasing participation of diverse businesses in the efficiency sector. procurement: california public utilities commission (cpuc) general order 156, issued in 1988, requires utilities of a certain size to develop and implement programs to increase the utilization of women-, minority-, and service-disabled veteran-owned businesses. the procurement goals for each affected utility specify that 5%, 15%, and 1.5% of procurement dollars go to women-, minority-, and service-disabled veteran-owned contractors, respectively (zabin et al. 2014). in 2015, the cpuc added lgbtq-owned firms to its supplier diversity program, which includes women-, minority-, and disabled veteran-owned businesses. in 2018, the cpuc reported that 0.11% ($38.8 million) of contracting work from utilities operating in california went to lgbtq- certified firms through the program. since 2008, various agencies within los angeles adopted \u201ccommunity career\u201d policies that require developers and contractors who build projects with public funding to meet hiring goals and sign a project labor agreement. the policies require 30%\u201340% of work to be completed by priority populations (residents in high-unemployment or high-poverty zip codes) of which 10% must be completed by disadvantaged workers (from low-income households, homeless, receiving public assistance, lacking a ged or high school diploma, history in the criminal justice system, single parents, or suffering from chronic unemployment) (zabin et al. 2014). similar contractor sourcing policies have been implemented at the california high speed rail authority, city of san francisco, city of portland, energy trust of oregon, city of seattle, and cuyahoga county, ohio (zabin et al. 2014). contractor training: from 2013 to 2014, the southern california regional energy network and los angeles county aimed to implement $30 million in energy efficiency retrofit projects while promoting local, small contractor participation (zabin et al. 2014). the county partnered with the emerald cities collaborative (ecc) to run the e-contractor academy, a seven-week training program to help contractors be successful in bidding on and completing public works projects. workshop topics included how to bid on energy efficiency projects, certifications, safety, labor compliance, bonding, and estimating. the e-contractor academy was successful in training and\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 33\\n\\n25 this report is available at no cost from the national renewable energy laboratory (nrel) at www.nrel.gov/publications. pre-qualifying small contractors, including those that did not focus on energy efficiency. however, there was an insufficient project pipeline to keep the number of trained contractors engaged in the program (soto 2020). additionally, the small contractors struggled to access sufficient bonding capacity to be able to bid on large projects. comed diverse service provider incubator program comed, the investor-owned utility in the chicago area, retains a contractor network for installing technologies that save energy through its business energy efficiency programs (comed 2020). in 2018, comed launched its diverse energy efficiency service provider incubator program with the intention of recruiting contractors from underrepresented populations (doyle 2020). comed provides funds for local organizations, such as the local hispanic american construction industry association, to recruit participants from minority-, women-, and veteran-owned businesses, as well as those with a diverse business enterprise certification. the program consists of a series of workshops on energy efficiency, comed\u2019s rebate offerings and processes, employment lead generation, and relationship development with financial institutions for small business loans and lines of credit. participants also receive mentorship and engage in networking opportunities. massachusetts clean energy center successful women in clean energy program each year, the massachusetts clean energy center (masscec) collects data on the demographics of the clean energy workforce in massachusetts. the data inform targeted programs to support underrepresented groups. when findings indicated that women comprised only 26% of clean energy hires, masscec implemented the successful women in clean energy program in 2016 to address specific barriers women might face in accessing clean energy careers (fitzpatrick 2014). the program supported 2 cohorts of 12 participants who received 15 weeks of training, enrollment in a higher education course, and placement in a six-month paid fellowship with an employer in the clean energy industry. masscec partnered with a training provider to run the program and address specific challenges faced by the participants, including coaching on financial literacy and soft skills. as of 2020, 50% of all program participants are still employed in the clean energy industry (jacques 2020). green city force\u2019s americorps green city force\u2019s (gcf\u2019s) servicecorps is an americorps program that works with young adults ages 18\u201324 who reside in the new york city housing authority to prepare them for green economy careers through service. being part of the servicecorps requires a full-time commitment that includes service, training, and skill-building experiences related to sustainable buildings and communities. gcf takes a holistic approach and provides training in a range of areas from composting to energy efficiency. gcf includes alumni initiatives to build inroads into specific careers within the green economy, such as solar and energy efficiency. gcf believes that young new york city housing authority residents are uniquely positioned to catalyze change in public housing communities while building skills, earning certifications, and gaining experience to help achieve economic prosperity. gcf emphasizes partnerships with residents, agencies, local and citywide organizations, funders, and employers to realize the change they envision.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 34\\n\\n26 this report is

efficiency for a sustainable tomorrow (best) center, funded in part by the national science foundation\u2019s advancing technological education award, was created to support the professional development of instructors in building science technician education programs (national science foundation n.d.). the best center coordinates a model curriculum, hosts teach-the-teacher events, supports the development and use of instructional laboratories at community colleges, and provides student resources such as career pathways and job boards (best center n.d.). by focusing on instructors, the best center helps community and technical college programs around the country stay current with industry research and technology and provides networking opportunities across institutions to help leverage instructor expertise and resources. the best center partners with lawrence berkeley national laboratory and industry partners to provide access to state-of-the-art building technology and energy management tools for instructional use. participating programs gain access to a network of similar programs and industry advisors, best practices for classroom instruction, curriculum and program design exchange, project- and problem-based learning opportunities, teaching laboratory specifications, workshops and networking events, and other benefits. the resources provided by the best center allow instructors and community college and technical programs to maintain and update their curriculum, though access to appropriate laboratory equipment can still be a barrier for developing programs. south seattle college sustainable building science technology program south seattle college offers a bachelor of applied science in sustainable building science technology (sbst), which is a 90-credit program designed for working professionals (south seattle college n.d.). tuition is approximately $25,000 over the two-year program, and students often receive assistance from their employers, scholarships, or veterans\u2019 benefits. veterans without benefits from the u.s. department of veterans affairs pay half-priced tuition. the sbst program partners with local organizations, such as apprenticeship & nontraditional employment for women, to recruit participants. the courses are offered in a combined online and face-to-face format to minimize interference with work schedules. courses meet in person one weekend per month and typically involve field trips and hands-on experiences with industry partners. students are required to earn 19 credits via internships and work experience practicums. the sbst program works with local industry partners to provide internship placements based on student capabilities and employer needs. the program is designed to help students develop technical knowledge (such as building and energy science), technological skills (via hands-on experience with building equipment), and professional skills (such as networking, resume, or portfolio development, along with using linkedin). students are recruited through local partners that work with diverse populations, and the 2020 cohort is more than 50% nonwhite and 25% female, with strong representation from veterans (abercrombie 2020). the sbst program\u2019s active technical advisory board of buildings industry representatives helps guide the program to address industry needs and provides connections for internship placements. typical cohorts consist of 12\u201320 students, although the program aims to expand over the next few years. resources that would support expansion include access to\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 35\\n\\n27 this report is available at no cost from the national renewable energy laboratory (nrel) at www.nrel.gov/publications. hands-on building equipment, virtual or 3d models of buildings to identify equipment performance, building data to support curriculum development, and assistance to help instructors deepen their expertise. workforce development council of seattle-king county upskill/backfill vocational training a 2016 study from the seattle jobs initiative estimated worker shortages in various industries, including a shortfall of 676 workers in the electrical, hvac/refrigeration, and plumbing/pipefitting trades (klaeysen 2016). based on this projection, the emerald cities collaborative (ecc) secured a grant from the workforce development council of seattle-king county, along with leveraged funds to \u201cupskill\u201d workers to operate hvac and electrical, plumbing, and mechanical systems in high-performance buildings and to train entry-level employees for newly created positions (workforce training and education coordinating board 2018). ecc worked with industry partners to adapt a one-year hvac/refrigeration curriculum into a five-month evening and weekend training program. the effort also included partnerships with local employers and community organizations to provide hands-on learning and recruit and refer participants. the first cohort aimed to upskill 22 incumbent building operators in tools and techniques to improve energy and water efficiency and enroll in the \u201cbuilding operation certification 1\u201d issued by the northwest energy efficiency council. the second cohort provided 32 entry-level trainees with hvac/refrigeration training for building operators and helped participants earn certificates of completion from the construction industry training council of washington (emerald cities collaborative 2019). across the two cohorts, 52% of the trainees were people of color, and all of the trainings in the second cohort were required to meet workforce innovation and opportunity act criteria: underemployed or unemployed, very low-income, formerly incarcerated, limited english, or other workforce innovation and opportunity act characteristics. ecc partnered with seattle jobs initiative to provide a career navigator to help trainees prepare resumes, apply for employment, or secure promotions. by august 2019, 81% of the entry-level participants completed the trainings, with 38% hired or promoted between march and august 2019.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 36\\n\\n28 this report is available at no cost from the national renewable energy laboratory (nrel) at www.nrel.gov/publications.
