(a non-profit entity based on austin, texas), residential rates from austin energy (the municipal electric utility in austin, texas), der ownership costs from various nationwide pilot programs, and incentives offered by electric utilities in the united states. results show that for constant electricity rates, the overall expenditure is least when the customer owns solar panels without storage, while for time-varying pricing structures, the least expensive scenario is one where the customer does not own any ders. as the capital costs for ders decline, utilities incentivize customer ownership of ders, and more residential customers face the decision of whether to invest in ders, this study aims to be a key tool in aiding that decision-making process. view conference cite citation formats \u2022 mla \u2022 apa \u2022 chicago \u2022 bibtex bandyopadhyay, arkasama, et al. \"a decision support tool for distributed solar and storage\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 3\\n\\ninvestments: a case study in austin, tx.\" asme, vol. 6, jan. 2020. https://doi.org/10.1115/ imece2019-11068 \ud83d\uddce copy to clipboard bandyopadhyay, arkasama, conger, julia p., webber, michael e., & leibowicz, benjamin d.
