      "data. yellow highlighted text represents 40% or more of wind employers rating wind energy-specific professional certification or a wind-specific college degree as \"very or somewhat important.\" this applies to a minority of occupations. by comparing the average across the three, we see that wind employers desire their new hires to have been exposed to some basic level of wind energy training, but requirements for professional certification or wind-specific college degrees are not important for the majority of occupations in the wind industry. please note that wind energy-specific programs are recent developments. thus, it is possible that employers not rating these programs as important may be due to the fact that until recently, few if any were available.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 19\\n\\n13 this report is available at no cost from the national renewable energy laboratory (nrel) at www.nrel.gov/publications. table 9. importance of different

relative importance of a wind-specific college degree to that of a college degree that is not specifically focused on wind energy. the table is ranked high to low on this ratio, which is shown in the far right column. with the exception of a few occupations, only a minority of employers required college degrees specific to wind energy. all employers requiring wind technicians and assembly workers to hold a college degree felt that it is important that the degree is specific to wind energy. approximately half of wind employers claimed that it was important for new hires to have a wind-specific degree in the occupations of development technical specialists, research engineers, and professors/teachers. table 10. importance of wind energy college degrees vs. degrees not related to wind energy

indicate that the vast majority of paralegals, administrative staff, and government regulatory workers in the wind industry are female (more than 80%). the majority of o&m accountants/bookkeepers, supply chain/purchasing managers, and development finance employees are women. women made up less than 20% of employees in 12 of the 26 occupations studied during this research. responses to survey questions asking about minority representation (including women) tend to overstate the number of minorities in a business if that minority is a protected class of worker (jordan 2012). table 11.
