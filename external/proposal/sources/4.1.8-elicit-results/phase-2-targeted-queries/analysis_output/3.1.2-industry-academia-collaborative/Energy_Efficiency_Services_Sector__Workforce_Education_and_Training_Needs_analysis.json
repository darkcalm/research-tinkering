      "communication alone, they anticipated having 25 students ready to enroll by the first year, and would have as many as 100 students enrolled in two years. one contact affiliated with a policy program indicated that program enrollment had grown 30% between 2003 and 2008, but did not expect to maintain that level of growth due to an inability to add space and/or expand faculty. a respondent from an engineering program noted that one energy efficiency- related class that used to have four to five students had grown to 15. another respondent expected their institution\u2019s policy-oriented program to reach maximum capacity in 2009 after several years of growth and to start wait-listing potential students. survey respondents also indicated that job placement is high for four-year energy efficiency programs. in 2008, the pool of approximately 1,000 college and university graduates in energy efficiency quickly found work. respondents at the various colleges and universities indicated that 90-100% of advanced-degree graduates found energy efficiency-specific jobs within six months of graduation. the following comments were common in our interviews with community and four-year colleges. \u201cwe cannot fill demand now. i can pick up the phone and place people in jobs.\u201d \u201cthere is actually a waiting list of employers [for our students].\u201d \u201cstudents are overwhelmed with offers.\u201d however, as several respondents pointed out, the highly skilled graduates tend to congregate in the \u201cstates with strong energy efficiency policies,\u201d such as california, new york, and wisconsin. similarly, in states with a long history of large-scale ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs, many building and construction tradespeople have experience working with energy efficiency program administrators. as energy efficiency expands to states without this history and infrastructure, members of the building and construction community will need support to build awareness, experience, and connected networks. one trades contact noted that \u201cwe're in the boondocks and it's hard to get any kind of [energy efficiency] speaker out here. [training needs are] more acute here because we are so isolated.\u201d32 similarly, there will be a need for more four-year programs that will have graduates interested in placement in areas where energy efficiency is just surfacing. 32 trades contacts in several midwestern states and in rural areas of texas indicated that their organizations could not attract enough qualified trainers to meet demand.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 53\\n\\neess workforce education and training needs 35 4.3 creating and supporting training for the building and construction industry as large-scale energy efficiency programs expand beyond california, the pacific northwest, the northeast, and upper midwest, those states and regions that have limited energy efficiency services infrastructure will face the challenge of rapidly creating and supporting increased education and training opportunities, particularly for the building and construction industry. energy efficiency education and training are a key component of a state\u2019s strategy to facilitate a smooth expansion of energy efficiency programs and market activity. the effort underway in new york provides an example of a broad statewide education/training effort. as discussed earlier in this report, nyserda\u2019s collaboration with hudson valley community college (see sidebar) is structured to increase the skills of the building and construction contractors and tradespeople. this type of training infrastructure can help states that are ramping up energy efficiency programs if building and construction contractors and trades are much less aware of energy efficiency-specific design and construction practices. another approach is to integrate building and industrial process system efficiency into existing curricula. this could be a cost-effective way to train large numbers of electricians, hvac contractors, mechanical insulators, home builders and others. as one union contact said, teaching efficiency relies on \u201cusing existing skills and applying it to new technologies and measures.\u201d because the building and construction trades constitute approximately 75% of the overall eess workforce, this is the sector of the workforce for which training in energy efficiency can have a great impact. one union trainer from a midwestern state said his program was beginning to shift focus from specific systems, to providing \u201ccross-skills training across our various unions.\u201d this could be useful for other, similar, union training programs. he said this change offered an ideal opportunity to integrate energy efficiency training into his programs, due to its whole-building approach. for instance, through cross-training, a carpenter can learn from an electrician how to make it easier for the electrician to run wire in a building, while also reducing the number of penetrations that might affect the building envelope\u2019s efficiency. cross-training also helps the electrician collaborate with the mechanical contractor to integrate the building\u2019s lighting and hvac systems to minimize energy use. expansion in training is underway, or soon will begin. respondents at community colleges that already have hvac, construction technology, and other building trades-related programs said their institutions were likely to incorporate energy efficiency into their curricula. in california, a concerted effort is underway to expand energy efficiency training at community colleges in selected occupations (see appendix b). respondents indicated that this change will not require a significant investment or a total revamping of their programs, but they will have to adapt their curricula and train more instructors.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 54\\n\\neess workforce education and training needs 36 4.4 expansion of educational efforts for professionals while the primary need for expanded training in terms of sheer numbers is with the building and construction trades and contractors, four-year educational institutions also have an important role to play to prepare architecture, engineering, and social science professionals to be part of the eess. respondents expressed two needs: 1) multi-disciplinary approaches to energy efficiency education and training, and 2) an increase in the number of energy efficiency offerings and instructors. for example, four-year educational institutions in states that are just ramping up their energy efficiency programs could provide additional courses with multi-disciplinary and system approaches to energy efficiency. a faculty member in an engineering program said, \u201cbuilding systems are undervalued [in our programs]. buildings should be the first step in carbon reduction. energy efficiency should be [taught] in multiple areas of the campus, such as mechanical engineering, public policy, and business.\u201d while many ph.d.s in other disciplines stay in academia, most of the ph.d.s with energy efficiency expertise find jobs in industry, due to high demand, excellent compensation, and a shortage of high-level teaching positions. most of the four-year colleges and universities interviewed prefer faculty with a ph.d. and relevant experience and research, and an interest in teaching. respondents from engineering and architecture departments also felt it was important for faculty to have some field or industry experience. as one respondent involved in an engineering program put it, \u201cwe need people with hvac skills, modeling skills, and experience at the time of hire [because] we want [students] to have energy skills and think fluidly about energy.\u201d another respondent noted that industry experience provides a connection between academia and industry, which is important for graduates of these programs. the growth in demand for energy efficiency-related courses and programs may require educational institutions to add physical space and equipment to support education and training activities. respondents suggested that the current four-year programs were approaching maximum capacity and that future growth in these fields would have to occur at other institutions because funding is not available in public institutions to expand and grow programs. moreover, it typically takes many years to create a new program in four-year colleges and universities. one respondent said it took him eight years to develop a ph.d. program, and that it took several more years before the program awarded its first degrees. while several four-year institutions have begun the process to create new degree offerings, none had been established indiana institute of technology b.s. in energy engineering in 2008, the indiana institute of technology (iit) began offering its b.s. in energy engineering. iit\u2019s program is unique because of its focus on practical field experience and preparing engineering students for a career in energy efficiency. the program requires fundamental engineering courses, such as physics and calculus. students spend their junior year on a practical project to help a local business make its facilities more energy efficient. the program as also incorporates courses in renewable energy. iit promotes the program to potential students as an opportunity to launch a career in the industrial, commercial, and government sectors.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 55\\n\\neess workforce education and training needs 37 during our research period, though the indiana institute of technology (see sidebar) had just successfully launched a new program in 2008. across all programs, recent academic hires were rare; no program had hired more than one new faculty person in the past few years. one respondent from a well-established energy policy program said they had not hired a new faculty person since the mid-1980s, while another respondent at a policy-focused program said their professors were \u201cold\u201d and their program \u201chad not hired new people for a while.\u201d fifteen of 19 college and university respondents said they needed new faculty or staff positions to keep pace with enrollment, yet only one expected to receive funding for new faculty positions in the near term. as one architecture faculty contact noted, \u201cwe are desperate for two more faculty people, yet the university and state have no money [to support new faculty] even though the school has a clear interest in energy efficiency and sustainable living.\u201d one of the respondents noted that teachers and faculty also needed more opportunities to learn from one another at conferences or summer workshops. one such series was sponsored by the national science foundation between 2006 and 2008 and was commended by several respondents. these conferences or summer workshops also could raise the profile of the energy efficiency field and give graduate students venues to share their research about energy efficiency technologies, behaviors, and policies. 4.5 continuing education and training for professionals while the primary approaches being considered for training and education is to expand current programs, build new ones, and to integrate energy efficiency into existing education curricula, many professionals are already working that want or need training and education in energy efficiency. moreover, many of the people with the skills in energy efficiency are not in the universities. as one respondent noted, some design firms are so skilled at building commissioning that their staff should instruct ph.d. university faculty about the topic. thus, there is a need to bring the knowledge of the energy efficiency community into the training and education world and that takes different strategies. because professionals have many of the needed knowledge and skills, new skills for energy efficiency need to be targeted. for example, trade associations (and some four-year schools) are offering professional development courses to help practicing architects and engineers better understand system approaches to building design and construction. some respondents pointed out that it is important that practicing professionals be exposed to energy efficiency education and training that is tailored to the building stock and conditions found in specific regions (e.g. weather and building practices). one respondent in the northeast said it would be valuable to have more regional lighting and ventilation testing labs, similar to the integrated design labs in the pacific northwest sponsored by the northwest energy efficiency alliance (neea).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 56\\n\\neess workforce education and training needs 38 university/college contacts are offering professional development courses as part of their strategy to reach out to practicing professionals and indicated that this strategy might allow them to expand and meet demand for energy-efficiency practitioners without the costs associated with starting a new program or hiring more tenure-track faculty. one university that offers such courses is considering adding an energy-efficiency certificate or degree. a number of colleges/universities that cannot expand established programs or hire more tenure track faculty are examining how to educate practicing professionals through short-term classes, online programs, and workshops. this interest is driven in part by their experience that practicing professionals may require relatively little additional training to become effective providers of energy efficiency services. some contacts said they planned to offer distance learning options such as online courses as a relatively inexpensive alternative to constructing new facilities and hiring new faculty. when asked how a program would respond if demand for workers and professionals trained in energy efficiency were to double in the next five years, one respondent in a large energy engineering program said, \u201cwe would develop more tools and make them available online [and] we would offer more [short-term] trainings.\u201d he did not think that the program would grow proportional to demand by adding traditional classroom capability. contacts at some of the engineering schools pointed particularly to the example of the industrial assessment centers33 (iac) and suggested that such an approach could provide the additional benefit of training engineers, architects, and even policy and planning students in residential- and commercial-sector issue",
      "concerns about",
      "data was not systematically reported by colleges that responded to the survey. course enrollment data was reported by 21 community colleges in four of eight regions: a total of 2,252 students were enrolled in energy efficiency- related courses, and 4,234 students were enrolled in courses that may include energy efficiency content. the community colleges reported that almost all of these courses were enrolled at or above capacity with waiting lists (with a few exceptions). 3.3 ratepayer-funded energy efficiency education and training efforts a variety of education and training efforts have developed through direct support by program administrators of ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs. activities include collaboration with community and technical colleges and collaboration with trade associations and professional organizations. several states with large ratepayer-funded budgets have established workforce training centers and laboratories. the approach taken by the california public utilities commission and utilities has several distinctive features: 1) the importance of workforce education and development is recognized and identified as a separate programmatic element of the cpuc\u2019s long-term strategic plan for energy efficiency and the utility\u2019s approved budgets for energy efficiency (spending on workforce education and training is ~4% of the total ee budget), 2) the cpuc is funding a comprehensive workforce education and training needs assessment, and 3) the utilities have developed energy efficiency centers during the last decade that provide a geographic focus and physical presence for workforce education and training. the california public utilities commission (cpuc) recently approved a budget of about $100 million for workforce education\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 43\\n\\neess workforce education and training needs 25 and training activities for the 2010-2012 program cycle for the four investor-owned utilities (cpuc 2009). the approved programs were consistent with the cpuc long-term strategic plan, which identifies we&t strategies to promote the goal of \"developing the human capital necessary to achieve california's energy efficiency and demand-side management potential.\" the four program strategies are: 1) a statewide we&t needs assessment, 2) formation of a we&t task force, 3) a we&t web portal, and 4) development of programs for all levels of workforce education. about 67% of the we&t budget is targeted towards the ongoing we&t \u201ccentergies\u201d sub-program which supports the utilities\u2019 workforce development and education training centers: the pacific energy center in san francisco, the sce customer technology application center (ctac) in irwindale, and the san diego energy resource center (sderc). these centers provide classes for architects, engineers, lighting designers, contractors, building owners, and tradespeople on energy-efficient building solutions and showcase current lighting technologies so visitors can see the effects of these lighting solutions. about 16% of the we&t budget will go to the \u201cconnections\u201d sub-program which focuses on all educational levels, including k-12, to inspire interest in energy careers as well as future ee skill development.29 about 12% of the budget goes toward education and training for hvac workforce and building energy code officials. in new york, the new york energy research and development authority (nyserda) and the long island power authority (lipa) are supporting the development of 10 training centers at local community and technical colleges (see sidebar). this effort is the first in the country and is becoming a model for other states such as massachusetts, which is creating a similar energy efficiency training program. the northwest energy efficiency alliance (neea) supports a network of integrated design and lighting design laboratories co-located with architectural programs at universities in four pacific northwest states (wa, or, id, mt). these design labs provide design assistance to architects, lighting designers, and engineers, and provide classes for contractors and building owners to increase their understanding of energy-efficient building solutions. neea also provides online access to information and tools through their betterbricks.com website, an online portal to their commercial building services. in wisconsin, ratepayer funding supports the energy center of wisconsin (ecw), which offers a variety of courses on technical topics for energy efficiency architects, engineers, contractors and tradespeople through their program energy center university. energy center university provides a residential and commercial training series, a daylighting collaborative, the better buildings, better business conference, which draws 1,000 attendees, and webinars targeted at energy efficiency services practitioners. the energy center university program offerings are focused primarily on additional training for existing professionals and practitioners (e.g., advanced design and installation skills that move toward achieving net zero buildings). the webinars frequently garner 500-900 participants. funding for energy center university has averaged about $2m per year for the last 3 years, split roughly evenly between residential and c/i markets. 29 the utilities will work with educational, labor and community institutions to promote interest in green careers by k-12, community college, occupational, vocational, and major university students and assist in the growth of low- income and transitional workforce-targeted clean energy training programs.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 44\\n\\neess workforce education and training needs 26 3.4 third-party and trade association programs supporting energy efficiency the association of energy services professionals (aesp) and the association of energy engineers (aee) have courses directly targeted to energy efficiency. the aesp does not offer certificates, but does offer specific training in energy efficiency program planning, program implementation, marketing, and program evaluation targeted at professionals involved in ratepayer-funded energy efficiency efforts. aesp offered training courses between 1991 and 1995 and then resumed training courses in 2008. aesp reports training 350 professionals in 2008 and expects to train about 850 in 2009 and between 1,000 and 2,000 in 2010. aee has offered training since 1981. aee courses support a variety of certificates based on students\u2019 experience and completion of subject matter exams; aee reports that they certify about 1,500 people per year. there are two private-sector, for-profit organizations that offer training courses to managers and professionals in the energy industry (including courses in energy efficiency and dr). the electric utility consultants (euci) reported that 60-80 professionals are trained each year in energy efficiency and demand response course topics. many professional trade associations expect members to obtain continuing education credits and have developed programs that focus on green or sustainable buildings. for example, the american institute of architects (aia), the building owners and managers association (boma), and the american society of mechanical engineers (asme) offer specific training modules for energy efficiency or sustainability, but these modules are typically not certified by energy efficiency certification or accreditation bodies as they are focused on member needs. we were unable to obtain estimates of the number of members in these organizations that receive continuing education credits related to energy efficiency. however, based on our interviews with contacts at these organizations, participation in energy efficiency-related training is increasing and will likely continue to do so. 3.5 third-party certification and accreditation efforts over the long term, the viability of the eess depends in part on ensuring that energy efficiency projects are designed well, and installed by qualified professionals and technicians. quality assurance has been a significant concern to program administrators and is increasingly a concern in this environment of rapidly increasing energy efficiency funding. the concern is that as new firms enter the market or existing firms expand rapidly, some of these firms and their employees may lack the necessary training to properly design and install high-efficiency systems, which may undermine the effectiveness of the energy efficiency investment for the customer. energy efficiency certification and accreditation programs help address this issue. the association of energy engineers (aee), the building commissioning association (bca), the american society for heating, refrigerating and air-conditioning engineers (ashrae), the building performance institute (bpi), weatherization assistance program (wap), and commissioning refers to the process of providing documented confirmation that building systems function according the criteria set forth in the project documents to satisfy the owner\u2019s operational needs. (building commissioning association 2009)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 45\\n\\neess workforce education and training needs 27 residential energy services network (resnet) have developed programs that are specific to the energy efficiency industry. each of these organizations has committees of energy efficiency experts from industry, related associations, and academia that identify essential competencies for their field, and update them as technology and methods improve. these competencies form the framework of the certification testing processes they oversee. some organizations also provide access to training courses to prepare professionals for the certification exams, others accredit courses and trainers who independently offer courses to prepare professionals for the certification exam. aee, bca, ashrae, bpi, and wap certify individuals who meet eligibility requirements and complete a certification exam. these certification programs with exams offer additional assurance that people that have completed the program and passed the exam are knowledgeable about and qualified to provide specified building energy efficiency services. aee offers a wide range of certifications that recognize training and experience in various sub- areas of energy efficiency engineering. most of these certificate programs have eligibility criteria that include combinations of formal training and job experience, making the certification relatively available to professional engineers and to individuals who have on-the-job experience without formal training. the certified energy manager (cem) certificate is the oldest and most widely known certificate with over 6,000 cems granted since 1981(see sidebar on requirements of aee cem certificate). bpi\u2019s knowledge essential task list (ketl) identifies the information that a bpi-certified person has studied. the bpi has affiliates that are permitted to offer training to people seeking to be certified and to proctor their students taking the bpi certification exam. bpi has seen rapid growth in both certifications and training affiliates. bpi certified about 300 people in 2005, certified energy manager (cem) certification all aee cem candidates must attend one of aee\u2019s preparatory cem training seminars and complete and pass a four- hour written open-book exam, proctored by an approved exam administrators. the cem training seminars are open to those with a four-year engineering or architectural degree, registered professional engineers (pe) or registered architects (pa) or equivalent combination of training and experience. candidates must complete at minimum of 11 of the following 17 modules of the exam, including the three required modules. aee also recommends completion of a self-study course on the basics of energy management prior to taking the cem seminar. 1. codes & standards & indoor air quality",
