      "data into the platform by developing a local \u201cdata agent,\u201d which locally communicated with the utility data systems and then securely transferred data to the cloud-based derms. this architecture is shown in figure 2.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 15\\n\\n5 figure 2 utility interconnection architecture. the beyond derms platform uses a modern \u201cserverless\u201d cloud software architecture hosted on amazon web services. figure 3 describes the overall architecture of the software. this serverless architecture allows us to write code that responds to specific events (such as a device requesting a \u201cpacket\u201d of energy) without needing to also manage the computer servers that run the code. this asynchronous design aligns well with the asynchronous nature of our core software algorithms, which are designed to be \u201cdevice driven,\u201d rather than a more conventional top-down optimization approach in which data is collected from devices, centrally optimized, and then centrally dispatched. instead, our algorithms respond to requests from devices to consume (or produce) \u201cpackets\u201d of energy. in the serverless approach, each message from a device (iot message) triggers a set of code, which subsequently runs the appropriate calculations, records data in the databases, and responds to devices based on grid conditions. figure 3 cloud and iot architecture.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 16\\n\\n6 in this project, we were able to successfully implement the software architecture shown in figures 2 and 3, integrating with the partner utility\u2019s (vermont electric cooperative, vec) meter data management system, geographic information systems (gis), scada, and power flow data. using this architecture, we built a software module known as gridsolver, which allows the utility to visualize historical data for various assets within their network. power flow modeling in order to integrate a power flow model into the platform, we used a docker container (similar to a virtual machine), which includes the actual gridlab-d simulation engine, following the method developed by chassin et al at slac national accelerator laboratory.5 we subsequently built a scenario analysis tool into gridsolver, which allows us to run quasi-steady- state power flow simulations within the platform, based on historical utility ami data, which are fed into the docker container within our cloud software. we tested this power flow modeling tool using both the ieee 123 bus test case and a full set of distribution circuits provided by our utility partner vec. time series simulation in order to develop a time-series simulation of the ieee 123 node test case within gridsolver, we added anonymized time-series data collected from the utility-provided ami data to each load (or house) in the original network model. this provides us the ability to run the base case, as well as time-series (quasi steady-state time-series, qsts) simulations. der modeling the next subtask was to model ders within the platform, so that we could simulate the behavior of different types of devices as they were added to the system. in particular, we focused on the development of models of the following device types: \u2022 level 2 electric vehicle supply equipment (evses). \u2022 grid interactive water heaters. \u2022 grid-edge (residential scale) battery systems. \u2022 rooftop pv systems. \u2022 hvac systems (particularly with heat pumps). 5 d. chassin, v. lubeck, and a. teyber, \u201cstanford/slac development version of

various ders and grid services, we connected over 350 ders in partnership with our two utility partners, vec and bed. this fleet of ders includes the following set of devices: \u2022 electric hot water heaters using the mello smart thermostat for water heaters (\u223c300 units). \u2022 level 2 evses, primarily using the turbo dx from webasto (\u223c40 units). \u2022 mini-split heat pumps (\u223c5 units). \u2022 btm batteries and pv inverters (\u223c10 units). \u2022 rooftop pv systems. \u2022 heat, ventilation, and air conditioning (hvac) systems (particularly with heat pumps).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 18\\n\\n8 3 advanced use cases: grid services for der operations and validation in this project, we focused on developing algorithms for each of five different der use cases. 1. peak reduction, to mitigate costs associated with generation and capacity (i.e., resource adequacy). 2. energy arbitrage, to reduce energy costs by shifting load from high-cost periods to low- cost periods. 3. ancillary services, such as frequency regulation \u2014 reducing the need to use conventional resources, like gas turbines \u2014 to provide real-time grid balancing. 4. distribution network constraint management, in which ders are coordinated to ensure that distribution network voltages and currents remain within limits, thus providing non- wires alternatives to conventional distribution network upgrades. 5. resilience, in which ders react to local conditions to help users recover from bulk grid outages (e.g., with the help of solar power and batteries) or to support the resilience of the bulk grid by locally reacting to voltage and frequency deviations. while some of the use cases have been demonstrated in previous reports, the remainder of this section describes the algorithms used to implement advanced used cases related to mode transition, ancillary services such as frequency regulation, and black-sky-day operations. the underlying technology used in this project for coordinating distributed energy resources is known as packetized energy management.6 in this system, devices make randomized requests for \u201cpackets\u201d of energy (an amount of energy consumed over a fixed period of time) to a coordinator who accepts or denies requests based on the real-time energy consumption level, relative to a target. the target (\u201coptimized power reference\u201d in figure 4) is chosen via an optimization routine that can consider a wide range of different factors, including the price of energy, carbon emissions levels, renewable generation, or grid constraints. feedback from the coordinator allows the optimization engine to adjust the optimization formulation and thus the target setpoint for the aggregation of ders (the virtual battery, or vb). the result is the ability to coordinate a fleet of diverse ders as if they were a conventional power grid asset, such as a battery or a flexible power plant. 6 [ref to ieee spectrum article] https://spectrum.ieee.org/packetized-power-grid.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 19\\n\\n9 figure 4 an illustration of the overall control architecture for der coordination within the \u201cbeyond derms\u201d platform. ancillary services (frequency regulation) as variable energy resources such as wind and solar increase, an even greater need arises for real-time balancing resources that can rapidly respond to changes in both supply and demand. in most modern power systems, this real-time balancing comes largely from primary, secondary, and tertiary frequency reserves. when performing primary frequency regulation, a generator adjusts its active power in response to changes in the frequency of the locally measured ac voltage. for secondary frequency regulation (also known as automatic generation control, or agc), a generator adjusts its power output in response to a signal sent by the regional balancing authority every 2-6 seconds. this signal, known as area control error (ace), is based on a combination of the deviation between scheduled and actual power exports/inputs and the regionally measured voltage frequency. finally, for tertiary reserves (also known as contingency reserves), a generator agrees to rapidly increase its output in response to an unexpected loss of some other power generation resource. ferc order no. 2222 opens up the potential for aggregated demand-side resources that have an aggregate capacity of at least 100kw to provide ancillary services into wholesale electricity markets. the ruling makes it difficult for utilities to \u201cblock\u201d the participation of ders in ancillary service markets so long as they meet regional telemetry and other requirements. frequency regulation concept motivated by both the increasing need for balancing resources and changes in market rules, this project leveraged the \u201cbeyond derms\u201d platform to test the potential for a group of aggregated devices (a virtual power plant, or vpp) to provide secondary frequency regulation services. specifically, this portion of the project demonstrate that an aggregated group of ders can provide secondary frequency regulation by rapidly adjusting the aggregated power\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 20\\n\\n10 consumption in response to an agc signal. figure 5 illustrates the overall concept of a vpp bidding into the market with a \u201cfrequency regulation bid,\u201d then receiving an agc signal from the iso, and then adjusting net power consumption to match this signal. figure 5 an illustration of a virtual power plant (vpp) bidding its frequency regulation capacity into a market, and then adjusting its net power consumption to track with an agc signal. using the beyond derms platform for ancillary services in order to test the ability of the platform to perform ancillary services, we run several tests in which about 250 distributed energy resources (primarily water heaters) were connected to the platform and used for secondary frequency regulation. specifically, we tested the ability of the group of devices to track with a \u201creg-d\u201d test signal from pjm.7 this signal was then scaled to produce a signal that the fleet of devices could track (see experiments in the next section). experimental setup and results this section shows the results from several trials in which we tested the ability of the platform to deliver secondary frequency regulation services per the pjm reg-d test signal. each trial lasted about 40 minutes and used the same test signal. trials differed in the time of day, and in location of the tracking signal, relative to the baseline load. in each trial we measure performance using the three elements of the pjm frequency regulation performance scoring: accuracy, delay, and precision. accuracy is a measure of correlation between the signals. the delay score is based on the amount of delay between the 7 https://www.pjm.com/markets-and-operations/ancillary-services.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 21\\n\\n11 target and actual signals, and the precision score is based on the actual amount of error between the target and actual. each trial includes 208 online and connected devices. trial 1 (figure 6) was a test trial in which the target power level was set quite high, relative to the actual baseline load. as would be expected, this trial resulted in a low precision score (0.11). the accuracy and delay scores were 0.70 and 0.81, respectively, leading to an overall score of 0.54. figure 6 results from frequency regulation trial 1. the upper panel shows the target setpoint and the actual power. the lower two panels show elements of the pjm score and the number of \u201cenergy packets\u201d delivered in each time period. in trial 2 (figure 7) we scaled down the relative position of the setpoint, but not far enough to fully allow the load to track with the target signal. in this case, the accuracy score increased to 0.87, delay to 0.96, precision to 0.50, and the overall composite score was 0.78.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 22\\n\\n12 figure 7 results from frequency regulation trial 2 in which the target setpoint was scaled down to an average of about 60kw, which was still significantly higher than the average water heater load. this trial resulted in a composite pjm performance score of 0.78. in the final \u201ctrial 3\u201d (figure 8), we further scaled down the target setpoint to about 50kw, substantially increasing the overall performance scores. this case had an accuracy score of 0.95, delay of 0.99, precision of 0.77, and composite of 0.90. this score is on par with or exceeds the overall performance scores commonly achieved by natural gas power plants, which suggests that it is indeed possible for aggregated ders to provide frequency regulation services to the grid.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 23\\n\\n13 figure 8 results from frequency regulation trial 3 in which the target setpoint was scaled down to an average of about 50kw. this trial resulted in a composite pjm performance score of 0.90. consideration of stored energy in ders for ancillary services flexible load devices typically have some ability to shift the time at which they pull energy from the grid and \u201cstore\u201d energy. water heaters, refrigeration systems, and buildings store energy in thermal format. evs and btm batteries store energy chemically and pool pumps have a daily minimum run time that can be shifted through the day. understanding how much stored energy exists in a fleet of devices is a useful parameter in der scheduling in order to provide ancillary services. in order to understand this stored energy, we used the data from trial 3 and measured the aggregated amount of stored energy in the fleet but adding up the effective stored energy in each der (primarily water heaters). for a water heater, devices that are 10 degrees f above their setpoint are considered to be at 100% \u201cstate of charge\u201d (soc), and devices that are 10 degrees below their setpoint are considered to be at 0% soc. figure 9 shows the resulting state of charge for our fleet of devices. clearly, over the 40 minutes of this trial the total amount of stored energy decreases due to the fact that the target load level is held below the average/baseline for a significant portion of the time. in the final 15 minutes of the trial, stored energy increases again (as the overall load level is higher). this trial shows that it is feasible to monitor stored energy in a fleet of ders modeled as a virtual battery.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 24\\n\\n14 figure 9 stored energy from trial 3. the top panel shows the actual and target power timeseries (as in figure 8). the lower panel shows the total amount of stored energy in the fleet of ders. automatically transitioning among operating modes this use case demonstrates the ability of beyond derms to automatically switch between operating modes based on grid and market conditions. this use case demonstrates the algorithms for optimally switching in and out of ancillary service markets. in this use case, we optimize der scheduling among ancillary services, peak reduction, and energy arbitrage. performing this optimization requires bidding into wholesale ancillary service markets, which are only just now beginning to open up for btm der participation. to enable vbs so that they automatically detect the right time to transition from one operating mode to another, we used relatively simple rules. under this system, ders are scheduled to perform energy arbitrage when no peak events have been scheduled and when no network constraints are binding. when a distribution network constraint is binding, the ders \u201cbehind\u201d that constraint automatically switch to a constraint management mode under which they cease to perform services for the bulk grid and focus exclusively on ensuring that voltage and current limits are not violated. similarly, ders operate in arbitrage mode until they approach the pre-positioning period for a peak event, at which point they transition into peak management mode. once the peak event has concluded or the constraint is no longer binding, the ders return to focusing on their default load shaping grid service. motivating scenarios under normal operating conditions when distribution network constraints are not binding, ders can easily be set to provide services into wholesale electricity markets, such as load shifting for energy arbitrage or ancillary services. however, in the event of a need for peak\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 25\\n\\n15 reduction or constraint management, ders must switch operating modes to satisfy system constraints. in all cases, it is important to manage ders to honor customer quality of service (qos) limits. under normal conditions ders need to strictly adhere to these constraints. in the beyond derms platform ders typically default to an energy arbitrage mode under normal conditions when constraints are not binding. the question is, how can we automatically enable ders to switch to one of the other modes when it is advantageous or necessary to do so, without requiring unnecessary complexity in the control algorithms. here we look specifically at the case of automatically detecting \u201chigh-cost windows\u201d and triggering a switch to peak reduction mode when these windows occur. for this use case, we define a \u201chigh-cost window\u201d as a period of time when there is a very high probability that this particular hour is the peak hour of the month, which is when utilities in the region are assessed transmission fees based on their contribution to the peak monthly load. during these high-cost windows, it is optimal to transition from the relatively mild load shaping algorithm to an aggressive peak reduction mode. a key element of the project was enabling customers to stay informed of peak events through the mobile application associated with the platform. we have found that by allowing customers to be informed of events, the impact of peak reduction events has less negative impact on customers\u2019 experienced

deploy, and demonstrate a holistic platform that supports the integrated operation and planning of future power distribution networks with bi-directional power flows, many diverse distributed energy resources (ders), and inverter-based resources. the results demonstrate how emerging \u2018internet of energy\u2019 technologies can be leveraged to simultaneously solve the grid problems of today and prepare for the challenges of tomorrow in a way that goes beyond the capabilities of existing distributed energy resource management systems (derms). the beyond derms platform used in this project was developed from a study of the performance of over 300 smart energy devices, thousands of simulated devices, and data from over 20,000 smart meters connected on the distribution networks of two utility partners, vermont electric cooperative (vec) and burlington electric department (bed). these devices and data streams were used to test various functions on this single platform. the results clearly showed that the core \u201cbeyond derms\u201d concepts are feasible and motivate the need for a large-scale demonstration project to demonstrate how derms fits with other key elements of grid modernization that include advanced metering infrastructure, der and aggregations applying microgrid concepts. the project was organized in three phases: 1) conceptualization, 2) platform development and 3) advanced use cases. the accomplishments of each phase are summarized below. phase 1 (conceptualization) 1. development of the core beyond derms concepts and a derms platform for integration testing with 300 behind-the-meter (btm) ders including water heaters, electric vehicles (evs), and batteries. 2. initial system integration tests and simulations of the derms platform, in cooperation with utility partner(s). 3. demonstration of the core beyond derms concepts, such as integrating planning functions within the derms, and the capability to deliver grid services for the following: \u2022 peak load reduction to mitigate generation and transmission capacity costs. \u2022 load shaping (i.e., energy arbitrage) to reduce the cost of wholesale energy purchases needed to supply time-varying loads. \u2022 distribution network management services through a software system that can model and manage distribution network constraints in real time. \u2022 ancillary services for balancing authorities, independent system operator (iso), or regional transmission organization (rto). \u2022 resilience for consumers and for the grid as a whole.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 10\\n\\nviii
