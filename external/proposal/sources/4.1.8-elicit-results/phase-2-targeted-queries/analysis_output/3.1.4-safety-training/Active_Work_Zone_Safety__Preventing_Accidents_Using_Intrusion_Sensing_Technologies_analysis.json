      "communication using various technologies and systems, work zone intrusion alert systems can provide alerts to highway work zone personnel when hazardous situations are detected. this guide was created in an e\ufb00ort to e\ufb00ectively implement highway work zone intrusion alerts systems for work zone personnel. for proper implementation, several steps were created and discussed in this research. figure 9 presents the steps for implementation. subsequent sections of this guide describe in detail the best practices for each implementation step shown in figure 9. step 1: assign champion one of the most e\ufb00ective steps in implementing a highway work zone intrusion alert system for enhancing safety in highway work zones is to designate a \u201cchampion\u201d of implementing the system. the selected champion is an employee of the dot that is familiar with implementing systems or technologies. this person must be committed to implementing the selected technology. although the champion may have other responsibilities, implementing this system should be one of the person\u2019s top priorities. the champion should have the following characteristics: a basic understanding of the challenges of safety with dot employees in a highway work zone; previous experience with implementing systems within a dot environment; a desire to understand highway work zone intrusion alert systems. before other steps of the implementation process, the champion must fully understand the highway work zone intrusion alert systems. the champion must read this guide and create a plan based on best practices presented. step 2: select technology based on results of the review and experimental evaluation, several recommendations have been made for selecting and implementing work zone sensing technology. the frontiers in built environment | www.frontiersin.org 8 march 2019 | volume 5 | article 21\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 9\\n\\nawolusi and marks work zone intrusion sensing technologies figure 7 | results of vehicle stopping distance. figure 8 | summary of experimental results. implementation of the radio-based alarm for longer tapers in construction highway work zones where tra\ufb03c barrels or other longer term temporary devices are deployed is recommended. the pneumatic/microwave alarm is recommended for short tapers and short term or mobile highway work zone projects. each manufacturer provides speci\ufb01c step-by-step instructions on how to deploy and maintain the highway work zone intrusion alert systems. table 3 provides a selection guide for work zone intrusion detection devices. step 3: educate employees after assigning an implementation champion and selecting a highway work zone intrusion alert system, end users of the system must be educated. dot employees who work in highway work zones should be instructed about the value of work zone intrusion alerts, functionality of the systems, and how to maintain the devices. this educational component can be integrated into existing dot employee training and should be tailored toward those employees who will be the end users of the systems\u2013dot personnel in highway work zones. the training must include the following: (1) instructions and demonstrations of how to set- up the system, including mounting locations for all devices; (2) proper calibration of the system to the desired alert distance; and (3) explanation of the functionality of the system during use. the champion should create and organize the training materials, as well as conduct the training for the employees. several sets of highway work zone intrusion alert systems should be available for demonstration by the employees after the information is given. after all employees have received the required training, the systems should be deployed in initial \ufb01eld trials before extending to all active work zone projects. step 4: disseminate information once the system is deployed in an initial \ufb01eld trial, workers using the system should be surveyed. employees should be questioned about their ability to use the system, if they encountered any limitations, and suggested changes. changes to the education, calibration, and other variables should be made by the champion based on the results of the initial trials. feedback from employees should be acted on and communicated to the workers because they will be the end users of the system. step 5: maintain system the champion should implement strategies to maintain the highway work zone intrusion alert system. these strategies should include requiring workers to check the battery status before deployment (to know when a simple replacement of battery is required), maintain the system, and understand the requirements for updating training for workers utilizing the frontiers in built environment | www.frontiersin.org 9 march 2019 | volume 5 | article 21\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 10\\n\\nawolusi and marks work zone intrusion sensing technologies figure 9 | steps for implementation of work zone intrusion alert systems. table 3 | selection guide for work zone intrusion detection devices. situations radio-based alarm pneumatic/ microwave alarm longer than 1 day x one day or shorter x taper shorter than 457.2 m (1,500 ft.) x taper longer than or equal to 457.2 m x system. workers should be re-trained or updated at least every year for usage of the highway work zone alert system. conclusion the limited work space and ever-changing nature of highway construction work zones make the work environment very dangerous for pedestrian workers (fyhrie, 2016; gambatese and lee, 2016). active sensing and alert devices are not readily available in highway work zones and in transportation infrastructure construction and maintenance. the applicable intrusion technologies for work zone safety were reviewed in this paper. commercially available technologies were evaluated using experimental trials. this research contributes to the body of knowledge by providing strategies for selecting and implementing intrusion sensing technologies for active work zone safety. it is important to note that commercially available intrusion sensing technological systems are varied in their complexity and capabilities. this variation may or may not be re\ufb02ected in the cost of the system. furthermore, it was not concluded that commercially available technologies can be useful in every highway work zone situation. highway work zone environments provide unique challenges that can cause failure of commercially available systems. the \ufb01ndings of this review indicate that a few states have had di\ufb03culty in using most of the early intrusion alarm systems despite the e\ufb00orts made by the device manufacturers to improve these systems. some of the shortcomings of the technologies are lengthy set up time, false alarms, mis\ufb01res, and alignment di\ufb03culties. this has continued to hinder the widespread application of these technologies for work zone safety. for instance, there were challenges with the use of the kinematic alarm, which led to the inability of the research team to evaluate the technology at the time the radio-based and pneumatic/microwave alarms were evaluated. the results of the experimental evaluation of the radio- based and pneumatic/microwave alarms indicate that the two technologies produce more than one type of alert which can be used to warn workers when a vehicle intrudes a construction work zone. the \ufb01ndings also indicate that workers and vehicle drivers responded to the warning alerts provided by these technologies as observed in the reaction times obtained in the experimental trials. as expected, the worker\u2019s reaction time was on average <1 s, while the vehicle stopping time was less that the posted stopping time for vehicle traveling at the same speed used in this experimental evaluation. additionally, the performance of the two technologies evaluated by the research team was satisfactory in terms of power consumption as no issue"
