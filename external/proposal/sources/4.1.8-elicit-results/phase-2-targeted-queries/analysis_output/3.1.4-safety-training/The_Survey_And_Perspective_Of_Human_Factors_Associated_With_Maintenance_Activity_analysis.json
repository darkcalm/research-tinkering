      "communication, wrong application of devices, and unsafe working habits. job factors, such as working double shifts, workers having more work than they could handle, unclear relationships in reporting and conflict in work planning, and inadequate work standards are also the immediate causes of the accidents. in short, failure during maintenance may occur primarily due to human factors, organizational factors, and a lack of methods to establish a safe maintenance process. this paper presents a survey on human factors' effects on maintenance workers. the survey work is described in

contributes to stress for workers and companies. the maintenance activities and time are indeed related to the financial resources. such situations directly contribute to the increment of stress among workers and the management of companies. questions related to time and stress are provided in table 4. the responses to the questions are presented in figure 6. questions 3.1 to 3.6 show that

of workers on the work process for performing maintenance tasks 4.0 conclusion the survey identifies potential human factors associated with inspection and maintenance activities of the oil and gas industry in the united arab emirates (uae). ninety-three maintenance workers participated in the survey by answering the questionnaire provided in google forms. the survey comprises four performance shaping factors (psfs): experience and training, procedure, time and stress, and work processes. the responses show that both experience and training could improve the workers' skills and the success of the maintenance tasks. the results also indicate that training and education of maintenance workers are imperative and that experienced workers can handle abnormal situations. the survey results also concur with other researchers regarding the importance of proper and understandable work procedures [4], [10]. moreover, limited maintenance time could increase stress levels [11], [12]. it is recommended that the procedures are written effectively and attractively to facilitate workers\u2019 understanding of them. procedures prepared in pictorial form could be helpful to workers in grasping the procedures rather than a written format. furthermore, supervisors should be responsible for verbally conveying the procedures to the workers to ensure their understanding. novice workers are found to be incapable of understanding work procedures since the understanding is found to be influenced by one\u2019s experience. accordingly, novice workers must be mentored or coached by experienced employees. companies should also conduct training, refresher training, and regular coaching for novice workers to gradually develop their skills [13]. the safety and health procedures and communication should be improved to reduce the likelihood of mishaps. the research work (i.e., questionnaire distribution, recruitment, participation, and data collection) was conducted during the early lockdown due to the global pandemic. such situations limited the time and outreach to the industry in distributing the questionnaire and receiving participation. consequently, the numbers of respondents are small and cannot be generalized. furthermore, the research was limited to two maintenance emirate companies (namely sharjah and abu dhabi) out of seven. as a recommendation for better research work or survey on human factors and maintenance activities, researchers should i) increase the sample size, ii) develop hypotheses related to the use of industry 4.0 and how it affects workers and the maintenance work, and iii) relate human factors and maintenance activities to the existing acts or standards. 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 4.6 4.7

operation process; ineffective maintenance may have a negative effect on the machinery's or plant's performance. inadequate maintenance can shorten the life of equipment and plant and, consequently, have a potentially high risk of incidents or accidents. the complexity of maintenance tasks, poorly written maintenance procedures, fatigue among workers, lack of training and refresher training, or inadequate safety barriers are examples of ineffective maintenance programs. this paper presents a survey on human factors associated with maintenance activities in oil and gas plants in the united arab emirates (uae). the questionnaire comprises four performance-shaping factors (psfs): experience and training, procedures, time and stress, and work process. ninety-three respondents from the maintenance companies of the oil and gas industry participated in the survey. the responses show that both experience and training could improve the workers' skills and the success of the maintenance tasks. the results also indicate that training and education of maintenance workers are imperative and that experienced workers can handle abnormal situations. the responses suggest that both experience and training could improve the workers' skills and the success of the maintenance tasks. the maintenance activities are now adapting to industry 4.0; however, human factors may still be present. thus, it is appropriate for future research work to include the effectiveness of industry 4.0 in maintenance activities while considering the presence of human factors. keywords: human factor; maintenance; human error; performance shaping factors; risk-based inspection. \u00a9 2022 penerbit utm press. all rights reserved 1.0 introduction major accidents in process industries are often caused or linked to human errors and human factors. apart from studying the human factors, maintenance activities can be studied to link the relevant and possible human factors with these maintenance activities. maintenance is considered a crucial activity within a facility. the main objectives of maintenance activities are to ensure the smooth operation of an industrial system and preserve the equipment in a satisfactory condition for the performance of the intended functions. maintenance activities will be carried out by the maintenance personnel hired by the organization; if the maintenance personnel is affected by any human factors, the maintenance activities will also be affected. any mishap in the maintenance procedures will bring negative implications upon many of the other workers, even though they do not have any relevance to the maintenance team. this is how maintenance issues arise in a plant. for instance, if the organization fails to provide proper tools for maintenance activities, the personnel will not be able to carry out the task safely and properly. they will have to use the research article open access journal of energy and safety technology\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 2\\n\\ntitus o. ajewole et al./ jest \u2013 journal of energy and safety technology. vol. 5, no.2 (2022): 61-69 page | 62 readily available tools provided and proceed. this is very unsafe as the maintenance job cannot be done correctly. hence, the organization, which is part of the human factors, affects the maintenance activities of the plant indirectly. maintenance activities often require tasks, such as replacement, testing, inspection, cleaning, and adjustment, to keep the equipment in good condition for performance during the operation process and to comply with regulations. any organization or company should apply for an efficient maintenance program by maintaining the equipment before its failure, thus, avoiding the cost of failures and possible revenue loss. generally, applying an effective maintenance program can increase the equipment's lifetime and, subsequently, reduce the overall repair cost. therefore, maintenance activities play a vital role in minimizing the risk associated with several work activities and ensuring the continuity of the operation process [1],[2]. several standards, such as api-510, api-653, api-570, and api-580, have been published by the american petroleum institute (api). api organizes inspection intervals based on equipment life, consequences of failure, degradation rate, and environmental impact. the latest methodology is risk-based inspection built on api-580 and api-581. the main assumption of this methodology is that risk continues to be acceptable between two planned maintenance or inspection intervals. however, this condition may not hold true in a complex, fast-changing, or degrading engineering system [3]. the consequence of ineffective maintenance can shorten the lifespan of equipment or plant, cause injuries to workers liable to perform maintenance tasks, and lead to accidents or incidents. accidents during maintenance could occur due to mechanical failures, the complexity of maintenance tasks, poorly written maintenance procedures, fatigue among workers, lack of experience and refresher training, inadequate safety systems and barriers, and poor safety culture in the companies or organizations. quite often, many organizational factors were identified or addressed as latent errors leading to the failure of maintenance activity. organizational factors may include inadequate time to perform the required tasks, incomplete work processes because 'work-in-done' and 'work-as-imagine' are different, safety standards not understood, bad equipment design and insufficient financial resources to provide training to maintenance workers [4],[5],[6],[7],[8]. human factors associated with maintenance activities contribute to major accidents. these human factors are miscommunication, wrong application of devices, and unsafe working habits. job factors, such as working double shifts, workers having more work than they could handle, unclear relationships in reporting and conflict in work planning, and inadequate work standards are also the immediate causes of the accidents. in short, failure during maintenance may occur primarily due to human factors, organizational factors, and a lack of methods to establish a safe maintenance process. this paper presents a survey on human factors' effects on maintenance workers. the survey work is described in section 2.0, while the analysis of responses is discussed in section 3.0. the research work and survey were conducted in early 2020, towards the end of 2020, and the researchers have

safely. thirteen respondents neither agree nor disagree with the availability of written procedures. question 2.2 shows that sixty and thirty respondents strongly agree and agree that inadequate information on maintenance procedures could lead to incidents or accidents. question 2.3 asked respondents about the potential of an incident or accident if performing maintenance tasks without procedures. fifty-eight respondents strongly agree, and twenty-five respondents agree with question 2.3. similar responses can be observed for question 2.4. the feedback on question 2.5 is interesting\u2014sixty-nine respondents strongly agree that they always read the procedures before performing maintenance jobs\u2014 because it is the highest among all questions in part 2. question 2.7 shows a mixed perception of understanding some steps in the procedures. nineteen respondents admitted that they took shortcuts in some steps to have work done within a short time. table 3:

tasks. 3.4 time and stress time is essential to maintenance: pre, during, and post. thus, time and stress can be correlated; for example, inadequate time to complete maintenance activities effectively contributes to stress for workers and companies. the maintenance activities and time are indeed related to the financial resources. such situations directly contribute to the increment of stress among workers and the management of companies. questions related to time and stress are provided in table 4. the responses to the questions are presented in figure 6. questions 3.1 to 3.6 show that respondents strongly agree, between 35% to 54%. about 30% to 47% responded 'agree' for questions 3.1 to 3.6. table 4: questions related to time and stress while performing maintenance activity

respondents strongly agree that effective communication could prevent workers from making errors. responses to question 4.4 are varied: \"i need more time to understand or be on the same page with other people or supervisors.\" eleven respondents strongly agree, forty-two agree, twenty-one neither agree nor disagree, nine disagree, and ten strongly disagree. the same varied responses are observed for question 4.5: \"it was easy to report to management about problems or issues that they encounter when carrying out work.\" sixty-three respondents provided a positive perspective of a manager who spent some time on the shop floor and spoke about safety and health. fifty-two respondents strongly agree that management's commitment is crucial to a positive health and safety culture. question 4.8 has varied responses or perspectives regarding non-compliance to safety regulations and the cost. table 5: questions related to the work process for performing maintenance activities

of workers on the work process for performing maintenance tasks 4.0 conclusion the survey identifies potential human factors associated with inspection and maintenance activities of the oil and gas industry in the united arab emirates (uae). ninety-three maintenance workers participated in the survey by answering the questionnaire provided in google forms. the survey comprises four performance shaping factors (psfs): experience and training, procedure, time and stress, and work processes. the responses show that both experience and training could improve the workers' skills and the success of the maintenance tasks. the results also indicate that training and education of maintenance workers are imperative and that experienced workers can handle abnormal situations. the survey results also concur with other researchers regarding the importance of proper and understandable work procedures [4], [10]. moreover, limited maintenance time could increase stress levels [11], [12]. it is recommended that the procedures are written effectively and attractively to facilitate workers\u2019 understanding of them. procedures prepared in pictorial form could be helpful to workers in grasping the procedures rather than a written format. furthermore, supervisors should be responsible for verbally conveying the procedures to the workers to ensure their understanding. novice workers are found to be incapable of understanding work procedures since the understanding is found to be influenced by one\u2019s experience. accordingly, novice workers must be mentored or coached by experienced employees. companies should also conduct training, refresher training, and regular coaching for novice workers to gradually develop their skills [13]. the safety and health procedures and communication should be improved to reduce the likelihood of mishaps. the research work (i.e., questionnaire distribution, recruitment, participation, and data collection) was conducted during the early lockdown due to the global pandemic. such situations limited the time and outreach to the industry in distributing the questionnaire and receiving participation. consequently, the numbers of respondents are small and cannot be generalized. furthermore, the research was limited to two maintenance emirate companies (namely sharjah and abu dhabi) out of seven. as a recommendation for better research work or survey on human factors and maintenance activities, researchers should i) increase the sample size, ii) develop hypotheses related to the use of industry 4.0 and how it affects workers and the maintenance work, and iii) relate human factors and maintenance activities to the existing acts or standards. 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 4.6 4.7

future research work to include the effectiveness of industry 4.0 in maintenance activities while considering the presence of human factors in any industry. acknowledgments firstly, the authors would
