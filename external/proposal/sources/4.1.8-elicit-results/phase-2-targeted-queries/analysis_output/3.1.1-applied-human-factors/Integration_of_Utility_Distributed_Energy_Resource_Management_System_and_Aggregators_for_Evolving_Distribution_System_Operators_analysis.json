277\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 2\\n\\njournal of modern power systems and clean energy, vol. 10, no. 2, march 2022 are increasingly starting to aggregate into der groups, virtu\u2010 al power plants (vpps), and der communities, and conse\u2010 quently offer their services at the aggregated level, where they can present a considerable asset for balancing authori\u2010 ties and other market participants [7], [10]-[15]. nonetheless, such a core transition of traditionally passive distribution networks cannot be successfully performed with\u2010 out the accompanying modernization of control centers and the development of highly intelligent software systems to en\u2010 able real-time observability, control, aggregation, and protec\u2010 tion of increasingly complex distribution networks with huge numbers of ders dispersed throughout the distribution net\u2010 work. thus, emerging software solutions that are aimed to enable proper management and control of distribution net\u2010 works with high penetration of ders, called distributed ener\u2010 gy resource management systems (dermss), come into play [7], [10], [11], [15]. ideally, a derms solution should provide a wide range of tools, which would benefit both dsos and end-customers. nonetheless, because these technologies are still very novel, the definition of a derms is vague and can often refer to very different der management solutions, spanning from vpps to demand response (dr) providers and der aggrega\u2010 tors, and to centralized enterprise systems, called utility derms or grid derms. further, derms should be con\u2010 sidered as a logical entity rather than as a physical platform. derms functionalities can reside in other enterprise plat\u2010 forms such as the advanced distribution management system (adms). this paper uses the term utility derms for sim\u2010 plicity, but it might refer to having the functionality of con\u2010 trolling der in the applications such as volt/var optimiza\u2010 tion (vvo) and peak load management in adms or dms solutions used by utilities in north america. the confusion among the key stakeholders arises because even though all these solutions and grouped functionalities are frequently simply called derms, they have different sets of tools and aim to provide different services to different stakeholders. two examples\u2013both often called derms\u2013are der aggre\u2010 gators and utility derms. although the aim of both might seem similar\u2013to manage and control ders, these two solu\u2010 tions differ widely in their nature and responsibilities [11], [15]. this poor understanding of the available technologies and their functionalities often leads to distribution utilities being reluctant in implementing derms, which consequent\u2010 ly defers der integration, or even worse, leads to serious is\u2010 sues caused by high penetration of ders, but without a proper tool for controlling and managing such an evolving environment. thus, the main motivation of this paper is to fill this gap and clarify the confusion when using the term derms, through clearly distinguishing between the structure and au\u2010 thority of different der management software solutions and explaining their different roles and responsibilities. further, it is our aim to present how the two solutions on the oppo\u2010 site ends of this spectrum, i.e., a der aggregator and a utili\u2010 ty derms, can complement each other when deployed to\u2010 gether and offer a comprehensive set of tools for optimally managing all ders, from small-scale, behind-the-meter, to large-scale ders connected to the middle-voltage network. finally, we will present our vision how this integration en\u2010 ables both the dsos and end-customers to overcome the challenges imposed by high penetration of ders, and fur\u2010 ther, how this can enable them to reap the highest possible benefits from ders and their services. for dsos, addition of derms to their control centers be\u2010 comes inevitable with the ever-increasing penetration of ders to properly observe, manage, control, and protect their corresponding grids; while for the end-customers, it enables them to properly offer their services to dsos and balancing parties, and help in dynamically managing the emerging grids. to further validate our points and to showcase where the power system community and industry currently stands with derms, at the end of the paper, we present several re\u2010 al-life use cases from ongoing projects from schneider elec\u2010 tric and the national renewable energy laboratory (nrel), where the integration of various der management software solutions has already been tested in the real-life environment. thus, the contributions of this paper are as follows. 1) the logical concept of derms, including all levels of hierarchy, is clearly introduced in this paper. 2) the inevitable need for the emerging distribution net\u2010 work control centers to implement derms is elaborated in detail and the benefits of integrated centralized der manage\u2010 ment solutions, i.e., utility derms, and decentralized ones, i.e., der aggregators, are comprehensively presented. 3) the proposed claims are validated on the most recent, real-life projects, where these benefits have been already proven. taken together, we hope that this effort will lead to better understanding of derms concept within academia and in\u2010 dustry, and that it will contribute to faster implementation of derms into distribution network control centers globally. the rest of this paper is organized as follows. section ii presents the challenges imposed by high penetration of ders to distribution networks. section iii introduces and discusses the utility derms and der aggregator concepts and reveals the authors\u2019 view of their complementary na\u2010 tures. section iv presents several use cases from ongoing projects that describes the progression of different derms solutions all the way up to the integration of utility derms and der aggregators to provide optimal benefits to dsos and end-customers. section v concludes the paper. ii. challenges imposed by high penetration of ders to distribution networks ders introduce several different categories of challenges to the traditionally passive distribution networks. first, the addition of high penetration of ders into the existing distri\u2010 bution networks, if poorly planned, can infer instability, con\u2010 gestion, and other technical issues. moreover, the addition of ders can require huge investments by the utilities to build new or strengthen the existing distribution network assets. furthermore, dgs and energy storage technologies, when managed improperly, can cause over-voltages on the existing feeders, and can considerably increase the voltages at their points of interconnection (pois) as well as at the neighbor\u2010 ing locations. moreover, because of the intermittent nature 278\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 3\\n\\nstrezoski et al.: integration of utility distributed energy resource management system and aggregators for evolving... of the renewable ders, in periods of low demand but high production of these resources (e.g., high solar irradiation or wind power), a new phenomenon of reverse power flow can occur. consequently, this issue could inaccurately trigger the reaction of protective devices, as well as cause voltage prob\u2010 lems and unpredicted variations along the feeders [11], [15]. finally, it is very hard to accurately predict the behavior of renewable dgs using the traditional forecasting methods; thus, if left unmanaged in real time, this added uncertainty could cause issues in the operation planning and manage\u2010 ment of emerging distribution networks. on the other hand, at the low-voltage side, where most of the end-customers are located, ever-increasing penetration of rooftop pvs, energy storages for households, as well as the massive integration of evs are significantly transforming the state of traditionally passive, low-voltage parts of distribu\u2010 tion networks, and driving the need for systematic and intel\u2010 ligent management. thus, distribution utilities and especially operators and grid engineers, must adapt to the emerging conditions by learning and adopting new technologies for planning and managing evolving distribution networks with high penetra\u2010 tion of ders. traditional practices and procedures that are used for managing passive distribution networks, are already outdated and inapplicable to these emerging conditions. how\u2010 ever, derms can successfully cope with der-imposed chal\u2010 lenges and secure the systematic and intelligent management of a wide range of different ders. further, derms technol\u2010 ogies strive to turn the potentially dangerous behavior of ders into operational and monetary benefits for utilities, as well as end-customers [15]-[18]. but there are different lev\u2010 els to the derms hierarchy, which aim to provide different services regarding der management, while targeting differ\u2010 ent ders relative to their sizes and connection point loca\u2010 tions (on a medium- or low-voltage distribution network). our goal is to show how the integration of two of these solutions, located on the opposite ends of the hierarchical spectrum, namely utility derms and der aggregators, can work in coherence. by complementing each other, they can provide a required set of tools for the integration and active management of all types of ders, regardless of their tech\u2010 nology, size, or connection point location. iii. different der management solutions and their complementary natures this section introduces a derms concept and presents the nature and characteristics of utility derms and der ag\u2010 gregators and the benefits of their integration to dsos. a. derms and its usage as the derms concept is novel and still emerging, the term derms itself is still vague and may refer to different solutions. generally speaking, the term derms corresponds to a software solution for managing high penetration of ders. however, because of its novelty, derms is often used to describe various different levels of software solu\u2010 tions aimed for managing ders. on the one hand, there are decentralized software packag\u2010 es that aim to aggregate behind-the-meter ders such as air- conditioning or heating devices, rooftop pvs, small-scale bat\u2010 teries, or evs, with the main goal to provide a better aware\u2010 ness of these small-scale but very dispersed assets and to provide their services in an aggregated and much more use\u2010 ful manner, e.g., by entering the electricity market or by pro\u2010 viding dr and energy-efficiency programs, among others [15]-[19]. on the other hand, there are fully centralized en\u2010 terprise systems that aim to provide services to the dsos, to enable them to swiftly overcome the challenges that ders impose on the distribution networks and their assets. these services range from providing situational awareness to manu\u2010 al/automatic der control, constraint resolution, and ad\u2010 vanced optimization applications for the efficient manage\u2010 ment of medium- to large-scale ders and der groups con\u2010 sisting of numerous small-scale units, with the objectives to provide operational and monetary benefits to the grid opera\u2010 tors and engineers in the control room and to grid planners that are responsible for the network upgrades and the addi\u2010 tion of new resources [11], [15]. both utility derms and der aggregators are frequently called derms, but these two solutions differ widely in their nature and responsibilities considering the existing real- world solutions applied in north america and worldwide. one is a centralized enterprise system, which is completely grid-aware, whereas the other is usually implemented as a decentralized solution that is unaware or partially aware of the grid conditions and limitations and is concerned only with ders and their internal conditions and responsibilities. but these two solutions also complement each other in se\u2010 curing a full spectrum of services essential for today\u2019s dsos, who are responsible for ensuring the safe, reliable, and optimal management of an ever-increasing penetration of ders [15]. b. roles and responsibilities of der management solutions the main role of der aggregators is to provide the aggre\u2010 gation of small-scale ders into der groups, and conse\u2010 quently to enable their services using the aggregated der power. the added value provided by der aggregators in\u2010 cludes enabling the participation of small-scale ders in the electricity markets, the engagement of ders and prosumers in energy-saving and energy-efficiency programs, the provi\u2010 sion of dr and load shedding services, as well as other mostly customer-related services. however, because of their structure that is generally adopted nowadays, der aggrega\u2010 tors are either not aware or only partially aware of the grid model and its conditions and technical boundaries, so they cannot guarantee not causing technical constraint violations such as congestions, voltage violations, or protection issues. thus, to enable the safe use of the services offered by der aggregators, dsos must have observability of the real-time conditions in the grid, as well as the ability to validate\u2013and modify, if necessary\u2013the schedules of der aggregators to avoid constraint violations on the grid assets. this is where a utility derms comes into play. utility derms solutions are intelligent, grid-aware software pack\u2010 ages that enable the full awareness, control, and optimal management of medium- to large-scale ders and der groups (consisting of behind-the-meter ders), with the goal 279\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 4\\n\\njournal of modern power systems and clean energy, vol. 10, no. 2, march 2022 of using all these resources to achieve system-wide benefits without violating grid constraints. further, utility derms so\u2010 lutions use all available resources to solve existing violations or predicted constraint violations and keep the system in a stable and optimal state in real time. therefore, for large- and medium-scale ders, whose impact on the grid condi\u2010 tions can be significant, a grid-aware utility derms is a nat\u2010 ural solution for their management and control [11], [15]. even though both solutions are concerned with der man\u2010 agement, utility derms and der aggregators are vastly dif\u2010 ferent software packages, and thus they should not be re\u2010 ferred to by the same term. referring to both solutions as derms leads to confusion, even among parties interested in deploying derms (i.e., electric utilities), and thus it should be abandoned. from the standpoint of dso, utility derms and der aggregators should be understood as different lev\u2010 els in a hierarchy: der aggregators mainly communicate with behind-the-meter units and use them in an aggregated fashion to provide various services regarding customer en\u2010 gagement and operations. besides, utility derms uses der aggregators, among other resources such as individual medi\u2010 um- to large-scale ders, various types of der groups, vpps, microgrids, and traditional resources such as switches and capacitors, to provide dsos with a complete awareness as well as effortless, real-time, look-ahead constraint manage\u2010 ment and the optimal coordination and management of ders, der groups, and other system-wide operations. therefore, if properly integrated, a der aggregator and utili\u2010 ty derms can complement each other and provide a full spectrum of der services regarding both customer-related and grid-related operations, which is regardless of the sizes and locations of ders. c. integration of utility derms and der aggregators: an ideal case even though both a der aggregator and a utility derms can be used as a stand-alone solution and can successfully provide numerous benefits, their values are tremendously in\u2010 creased when they are integrated and used together. when they are properly integrated and set to work coherently, these two solutions can cover a full spectrum of der man\u2010 agement services and can open a new world of possibilities for dsos to use ders as valuable resources in performing a broad set of required operations, both grid-related and cus\u2010 tomer-related [15], [19]. through (near) real-time communications and data ex\u2010 change with a utility derms, der aggregators highly en\u2010 hance dsos\u2019 awareness of and ability to manage behind-the- meter ders, especially in customer-related operations such as participation in electricity market and dr or energy-effi\u2010 ciency schemes. nonetheless, through its advanced applica\u2010 tions such as hosting capacity, real-time and look-ahead con\u2010 straint management, volt/var/watt optimization, demand flexi\u2010 bility, load and der forecast, and through sophisticated inte\u2010 gration with der aggregators, utility derms enables dsos with an ability to successfully manage and optimize their emerging distribution systems with high penetration of differ\u2010 ent ders, which are dispersed throughout the grid (from be\u2010 hind-the-meter to large-scale ders connected to the medi\u2010 um-voltage distribution network) [19]. further, der aggregators, if integrated with a utility derms, would be able to provide a much better quality of their services because all their scheduled programs could be validated by a utility derms, therefore ensuring that none of the technical constraints are ever violated. hence, this in\u2010 tegration would ultimately lead dsos to a much-needed transformation into a new era of future distribution systems with high penetration of ders. near real-time communication in this context is envi\u2010 sioned through supervisory control and data acquisition (scada) and internet protocols, but can also be performed through custom-made application programing interfaces (apis). using custom-made apis is a current practice, as in many cases, a utility derms of the specific vendor on one side, and a der aggregator on the other side, do not support the same protocols. hopefully, this practice will soon change, as the standardization of the communication proto\u2010 cols is currently taking place, and for example, the ieee 2030.5 protocol is a very promising solution that could be useful on both ends. the information exchanged through this communication often consists of advanced metering infrastructure (ami) measurements that an aggregator collects for behind-the-me\u2010 ter resources, as well as forecasted production of small-scale ders controlled by der aggregators and their operation schedules. these data are then used in near real-time applica\u2010 tions of the utility derms, i.e., state estimation, to improve situation awareness, as well as in constraint management and grid optimization for near real-time and forecasted peri\u2010 ods. thus, not only the observability of the grid conditions in near real-time is significantly improved, but also the pre\u2010 dictions of the constraint violations can be performed with more accuracy and consequently they can be managed proac\u2010 tively. iv. real-life use cases for utility derms and der aggregators this section presents several real-life use cases that dem\u2010 onstrate the progression of different derms solutions all the way up to the integration of utility derms and der ag\u2010 gregators to provide benefits to dsos and end-customers. the following examples have already been tested or are cur\u2010 rently being tested in industrial and academic projects, using commercially available or prototype utility derms and der aggregator solutions. a. distribution voltage management and peak load reduc\u2010 tion through utility derms this use case demonstrates a utility derms that directly controls residential ders that are owned by the utility. these ders are aggregated and controlled as a vpp to pro\u2010 vide peak demand reduction while enforcing the voltage reg\u2010 ulation. this utility derms is a software prototype devel\u2010 oped by nrel [20] (originally referred as real-time optimal power flow) by using a feedback-based real-time optimiza\u2010 tion algorithm [21], [22]. a distribution feeder, located in colorado within the ser\u2010 vice territory of an electric utility in north america, is used 280\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 5\\n\\nstrezoski et al.: integration of utility distributed energy resource management system and aggregators for evolving... as the simulation test system in this study. there are 1137 residential loads modeled, of which 163 loads represent all- electric homes. these all-electric homes are assumed to have residential rooftop pv and battery energy storage system (bess) installed on their premises that participate in the vpp and voltage regulation controls through the utility derms. the experiments are conducted in the adms test\u2010 bed [14], [23], [24]. the testbed was developed by nrel and the u. s. department of energy\u2019s (doe\u2019s) office of electricity for vendor-neutral evaluation of distribution man\u2010 agement strategies and through that, to help accelerate ad\u2010 ms deployments among dsos. the testbed uses multi-times\u2010 cale simulation platforms of distribution system models, in\u2010 terfaced with physical hardware to represent real-world and hypothetical future system conditions. the testbed also has a communication interface that allows adms and other utility management systems such as derms to interface with the testbed using industry-standard protocols. nrel works with utility, industry, and other research groups, to identify and evaluate adms applications that are important for grid mod\u2010 ernization. the simulations for this use case are conducted on the adms testbed using the data from a representative peak load day on january 27, 2018. figure 1 shows the results from utility derms use case, including substation power, total bess power output, and average bess state of charge (soc). high load consumptions are observed during 07:00-08:00 and 17:00-23:00 for the baseline (no control) scenario. with besss controlled by the utility derms, they discharge pow\u2010 er to offset the high load consumptions during these periods and recoup the energy by charging in other periods. voltage regulation is implemented simultaneously by controlling the reactive power output of pv inverters. figure 2 shows the results of the system voltages and the active and reactive power outputs of pv inverters when pvs are controlled by the utility derms. reactive power support provided by pv inverters is used to mitigate over-voltage without causing pv curtailment. the negative pv reactive power

monitoring and control in emerging distribu\u2010 tion networks with large amounts of dispersed ders utility derms provides accurate situation awareness of real-time conditions in the grid to the operator, including voltages, current and power flows, and congestions, through scada and ami systems [13]. moreover, through sophisti\u2010 cated load and der forecast algorithms, accurate predictions of future grid conditions are estimated by utility derms systems; however, with the emergence of high penetration of behind-the-meter ders and flexible loads, which are fre\u2010 quently not connected to scada or ami systems, their con\u2010 ditions have traditionally been estimated using state estima\u2010 tion or other advanced applications [13], [15]. besides, der aggregators enable near real-time measurements of small- scale ders that are not connected to scada or ami as well as accurate forecasted behavior of der groups compris\u2010 ing these small ders. with these data being constantly im\u2010 ported from der aggregators, a utility derms increases the accuracy of the real-time situational awareness and ex\u2010 pands it to the grid-edge devices [13], [15]. this use case describes a study of the ability of der ag\u2010 gregator and adms (with utility derms functionalities) co\u2010 ordination to achieve situation awareness and voltage regula\u2010 tion in the presence of very high penetration of ders, using the nrel adms testbed [14], [24], [25]. when high pv generation is present, the voltage regula\u2010 tion is a major issue. this use case also demonstrates the ability of the real-time optimal power flow [20] introduced in section iv-a to coordinate with an adms to enforce the voltage regulation in the distribution feeders. specifically, the adms reduces the bus voltages to mitigate the voltage rise and the der aggregator dispatches the pv smart invert\u2010 ers to further resolve the voltage issues. this study models a set of four distribution feeders sup\u2010 plied by a 30 mva, 110 kv/13.2 kv substation transformer in opendss. the model is developed based on the data from a north american electric utility. the topology of this model is shown in fig. 3. the feeders, located in colorado, serve nearly 6000 customers and have more than 13000 bus\u2010 es. the substation transformer is equipped with a load tap changer (ltc). additionally, there are 13 switched capacitor banks with a total rating of 15.6 mvar available for voltage regulation and reactive power management. more than 3000 distributed pv systems are added to the model with a total rating of 24 mw (about 200% relative to the minimum load) to simulate a scenario with high pv penetration. the experiments for two scenarios are carried out, as de\u2010 scribed in [25], for 4 hours of simulation time to study the coordinated operation of the adms and der aggregator in accomplishing the voltage regulation. in the first scenario, re\u2010 ferred to as the baseline, the controls of the adms and der aggregator are turned off. the legacy devices (ltc and capacitor banks) follow their local controller responses and the pv smart inverters inject power at unity power fac\u2010 tor. the bus voltages from this scenario are shown in fig. 4(a). it is evident that many buses experience over-voltage issues, i.e., voltages above the upper voltage limit of american na\u2010 tional standards institute (ansi) (1.05 p.u.) during the simu\u2010 lated period. in the second scenario, referred to as the virtual reality (vr)-enabled scenario, the vvo of adms is enabled with the voltage regulation (customer voltage improvement) as the control objective. this study uses the adms developed by schneider electric [26]. the adms runs advanced model- based optimization using the vvo application to issue opti\u2010 mal set-points to the legacy devices, i.e., the ltc and capac\u2010 itor banks. since the scenario with high pv penetration in this use case considers residential rooftop pv systems only, they (pvs) are all assumed to be controlled by the der ag\u2010 gregator and not by the adms. the vvo of adms is config\u2010 ured to run every 5 min to issue the set-points to the legacy de\u2010 vices on the slow timescale. further, the real-time optimal power flow algorithm [27] is used to implement the der ag\u2010 gregator. the der aggregator commands are configured to run every 5 s to enforce the bus voltages to be within the limits using the reactive power compensation from the small-scale pv smart inverters and the active power curtailment, if needed. the results from the second scenario are shown in fig. 4(b)- (e). as observed in fig. 4(b), the adms reduces the ltc voltage regulation set-point to 119 v from the default ltc local controller set-point of 124 v during the initial few min\u2010 utes of the simulation. as a result, the ltc tap position is lowered to -5. consequently, the bus voltages are reduced and reasonably confined to the ansi voltage band from 0.95 p.u. to 1.05 p.u, as shown in fig. 4(d). thus, the voltage regulation is ensured despite the presence of high pv generation. the to\u2010 tal pv power outputs in both the scenarios are compared in fig. 4(e). as the pv inverters are not oversized, the der ag\u2010 gregator curtails the pv active power to allow reactive power absorption to regulate the voltage within operating limits. it is observed that approximately 9 kvar reactive power is absorbed by the pv smart inverters at around 10:00. c. utilizing ders to mitigate real-time constraint viola\u2010 tions after restoration of a de-energized island another related use case currently being tested by using the utility derms of schneider electric investigates how to optimally use ders to mitigate constraint violations after the restoration of a de-energized island [15]. feeder 1 feeder 3 feeder 2 feeder 4 substation switched capacitor primary network secondary network fig. 3. topology of studied model. 282\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 7\\n\\nstrezoski et al.: integration of utility distributed energy resource management system and aggregators for evolving... in a simulated environment, during the restoration of a de- energized island after a fault isolation, an overload is detect\u2010 ed at the beginning of the feeder, and an overload alarm ap\u2010 pears in the utility derms. it triggers a real-time constraint management application; and the application, among its re\u2010 sources for constraint resolution, detects a der group man\u2010 aged by a der aggregator consisting of batteries and solar pvs. the application computes the result that this der group can provide enough flexibility to mitigate the overload condition. the command is consequently sent to the der ag\u2010 gregator to increase the production of the resources in one of the der groups managed by it. finally, the der aggrega\u2010 tor dispatches the commands among its individual der as\u2010 sets to increase production and alleviate congestion. through the real-time measurements, the utility derms confirms that the overload issue is successfully mitigated, and the alarm disappears, informing the operator that the violation is successfully solved. d. participation of ders in electricity markets without vio\u2010 lating technical constraints in accordance with their integration with a day-ahead elec\u2010 tricity market, der aggregators determine schedules for their der groups. we propose that, to validate these sched\u2010 ules against technical constraints, der aggregators send these schedules to the utility derms. these schedules are considered within the look-ahead constraint management ap\u2010 plication of derms, which determines if some of the sched\u2010 ules would violate the technical constraints. therefore, for these der groups, modified schedules as well as the maxi\u2010 mum export and import limits are calculated within the derms and sent back to the der aggregators, along with the positive validations for the rest of the schedules that do not violate any constraint. the der aggregators accordingly modify the schedules for critical der groups, and it is final\u2010 ly ensured that all the new schedules are valid and safe to be implemented when the time comes. the integration of the utility derms and der aggregators is essential to effective\u2010 ly aggregate ders to provide bulk grid services [28]. a variation of this approach is a new grid control architec\u2010 ture, referred to as the federated architecture for secure and transactive distributed energy resource management solutions (fast-derms) [29], which is shown in fig. 5. it is current\u2010 ly under development and proposes a distribution utility derms, which consists of flexible resource schedulers (frss) and an frs coordinator. each frs schedules ders within a substation service area. the frs can control some ders, which may include a building (b) or microgrid (mg) directly and others through a der aggregator. yet others may be managed through a transactive market manager (tmm). the fast-derms project focuses on enabling scalable aggregation and near real-time management of utility-scale and small-scale ders through grid-aware, reliability-con\u2010 strained economic dispatch by the frs. it aims to support re\u2010 liable, resilient, and secure distribution and transmission net\u2010 work services. further, the advancements on multiple fronts, including communication standards, controls that effectively handle load and der uncertainties, transactive market struc\u2010 tures that ensure the protection of customer autonomy, der anomaly detection methods, and fail-safe der operating fig. 4. results from voltage regulation

abstract\u2014with the rapid integration of distributed energy re\u2010 sources (ders), distribution utilities are faced with new and un\u2010 precedented issues. new challenges introduced by high penetra\u2010 tion of ders range from poor observability to overload and re\u2010 verse power flow problems, under-/over-voltages, maloperation of legacy protection systems, and requirements for new plan\u2010 ning procedures. distribution utility personnel are not adequate\u2010 ly trained, and legacy control centers are not properly equipped to cope with these issues. fortunately, distribution energy re\u2010 source management systems (dermss) are emerging software technologies aimed to provide distribution system operators (dsos) with a specialized set of tools to enable them to over\u2010 come the issues caused by ders and to maximize the benefits of the presence of high penetration of these novel resources. however, as derms technology is still emerging, its definition is vague and can refer to very different levels of software hier\u2010 archies, spanning from decentralized virtual power plants to der aggregators and fully centralized enterprise systems (called utility derms). although they are all frequently simply called derms, these software technologies have different sets of tools and aim to provide different services to different stake\u2010 holders. this paper explores how these different software tech\u2010 nologies can complement each other, and how they can provide significant benefits to dsos in enabling them to successfully manage evolving distribution networks with high penetration of ders when they are integrated together into the control cen\u2010 ters of distribution utilities. index terms\u2014distributed generation, distributed energy re\u2010

(ders) worldwide, distribution net\u2010 works are evolving towards complex and dynamically chang\u2010 ing systems [1]-[3]. the term der itself relates to active re\u2010 sources connected to distribution networks and can include distributed generators (dgs) such as solar photovoltaic (pv) and wind generators, various types of energy storage sys\u2010 tems such as electric batteries or flywheels, as well as elec\u2010 tric vehicles (evs) and their charging stations [4], [5]. mas\u2010 sive integration of ders is introducing a high level of com\u2010 plexity in traditionally passive distribution networks, includ\u2010 ing their observability, management, control, and protection [6], [7]. poorly planned and stochastic integration of ders have been introducing challenges that are felt all over the distribu\u2010 tion network. first, distribution network operators (dnos) are facing increasing amounts of overloads on their feeders, over-/under-voltages at the der buses, and protection coor\u2010 dination and sensitivity issues due to the dynamic and often unpredictable behavior of ders [7] - [11]. second, end-cus\u2010 tomers, including behind-the-meter ders, now having an ability to produce more energy than they need, are becoming eager to trade with their excess energy and enter the electric\u2010 ity markets, but are often too small and do not possess eco\u2010 nomic leverage to gain significant attention and benefits from their services. these changes are accompanied with the restructuring of the traditional players in the electric power system area. two of the most important changes are as follows. first, the tradi\u2010 tional dnos are required to rapidly evolve into much more active operators, termed distribution system operators (dsos), that would be able to manage, protect, and control emerging distribution networks in near real time. second, tra\u2010 ditionally passive loads are rapidly evolving into much more dynamic \u201cprosumers\u201d, that can both consume and produce electric power, and even trade with the excess energy. final\u2010 ly, groups of prosumers and other behind-the-meter ders manuscript received: september 29, 2021;

(vpps), and der communities, and conse\u2010 quently offer their services at the aggregated level, where they can present a considerable asset for balancing authori\u2010 ties and other market participants [7], [10]-[15]. nonetheless, such a core transition of traditionally passive distribution networks cannot be successfully performed with\u2010 out the accompanying modernization of control centers and the development of highly intelligent software systems to en\u2010 able real-time observability, control, aggregation, and protec\u2010 tion of increasingly complex distribution networks with huge numbers of ders dispersed throughout the distribution net\u2010 work. thus, emerging software solutions that are aimed to enable proper management and control of distribution net\u2010 works with high penetration of ders, called distributed ener\u2010 gy resource management systems (dermss), come into play [7], [10], [11], [15]. ideally, a derms solution should provide a wide range of tools, which would benefit both dsos and end-customers. nonetheless, because these technologies are still very novel, the definition of a derms is vague and can often refer to very different der management solutions, spanning from vpps to demand response (dr) providers and der aggrega\u2010 tors, and to centralized enterprise systems, called utility derms or grid derms. further, derms should be con\u2010 sidered as a logical entity rather than as a physical platform. derms functionalities can reside in other enterprise plat\u2010 forms such as the advanced distribution management system (adms). this paper uses the term utility derms for sim\u2010 plicity, but it might refer to having the functionality of con\u2010 trolling der in the applications such as volt/var optimiza\u2010 tion (vvo) and peak load management in adms or dms solutions used by utilities in north america. the confusion among the key stakeholders arises because even though all these solutions and grouped functionalities are frequently simply called derms, they have different sets of tools and aim to provide different services to different stakeholders. two examples\u2013both often called derms\u2013are der aggre\u2010 gators and utility derms. although the aim of both might seem similar\u2013to manage and control ders, these two solu\u2010 tions differ widely in their nature and responsibilities [11], [15]. this poor understanding of the available technologies and their functionalities often leads to distribution utilities being reluctant in implementing derms, which consequent\u2010 ly defers der integration, or even worse, leads to serious is\u2010 sues caused by high penetration of ders, but without a proper tool for controlling and managing such an evolving environment. thus, the main motivation of this paper is to fill this gap and clarify the confusion when using the term derms, through clearly distinguishing between the structure and au\u2010 thority of different der management software solutions and explaining their different roles and responsibilities. further, it is our aim to present how the two solutions on the oppo\u2010 site ends of this spectrum, i.e., a der aggregator and a utili\u2010 ty derms, can complement each other when deployed to\u2010 gether and offer a comprehensive set of tools for optimally managing all ders, from small-scale, behind-the-meter, to large-scale ders connected to the middle-voltage network. finally, we will present our vision how this integration en\u2010 ables both the dsos and end-customers to overcome the challenges imposed by high penetration of ders, and fur\u2010 ther, how this can enable them to reap the highest possible benefits from ders and their services. for dsos, addition of derms to their control centers be\u2010 comes inevitable with the ever-increasing penetration of ders to properly observe, manage, control, and protect their corresponding grids; while for the end-customers, it enables them to properly offer their services to dsos and balancing parties, and help in dynamically managing the emerging grids. to further validate our points and to showcase where the power system community and industry currently stands with derms, at the end of the paper, we present several re\u2010 al-life use cases from ongoing projects from schneider elec\u2010 tric and the national renewable energy laboratory (nrel), where the integration of various der management software solutions has already been tested in the real-life environment. thus, the contributions of this paper are as follows. 1) the logical concept of derms, including all levels of hierarchy, is clearly introduced in this paper. 2) the inevitable need for the emerging distribution net\u2010 work control centers to implement derms is elaborated in detail and the benefits of integrated centralized der manage\u2010 ment solutions, i.e., utility derms, and decentralized ones, i.e., der aggregators, are comprehensively presented. 3) the proposed claims are validated on the most recent, real-life projects, where these benefits have been already proven. taken together, we hope that this effort will lead to better understanding of derms concept within academia and in\u2010 dustry, and that it will contribute to faster implementation of derms into distribution network control centers globally. the rest of this paper is organized as follows. section ii presents the challenges imposed by high penetration of ders to distribution networks. section iii introduces and discusses the utility derms and der aggregator concepts and reveals the authors\u2019 view of their complementary na\u2010 tures. section iv presents several use cases from ongoing projects that describes the progression of different derms solutions all the way up to the integration of utility derms and der aggregators to provide optimal benefits to dsos and end-customers. section v concludes the paper. ii. challenges imposed by high penetration of ders to distribution networks ders introduce several different categories of challenges to the traditionally passive distribution networks. first, the addition of high penetration of ders into the existing distri\u2010 bution networks, if poorly planned, can infer instability, con\u2010 gestion, and other technical issues. moreover, the addition of ders can require huge investments by the utilities to build new or strengthen the existing distribution network assets. furthermore, dgs and energy storage technologies, when managed improperly, can cause over-voltages on the existing feeders, and can considerably increase the voltages at their points of interconnection (pois) as well as at the neighbor\u2010 ing locations. moreover, because of the intermittent nature 278\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 3\\n\\nstrezoski et al.: integration of utility distributed energy resource management system and aggregators for evolving... of the renewable ders, in periods of low demand but high production of these resources (e.g., high solar irradiation or wind power), a new phenomenon of reverse power flow can occur. consequently, this issue could inaccurately trigger the reaction of protective devices, as well as cause voltage prob\u2010 lems and unpredicted variations along the feeders [11], [15]. finally, it is very hard to accurately predict the behavior of renewable dgs using the traditional forecasting methods; thus, if left unmanaged in real time, this added uncertainty could cause issues in the operation planning and manage\u2010 ment of emerging distribution networks. on the other hand, at the low-voltage side, where most of the end-customers are located, ever-increasing penetration of rooftop pvs, energy storages for households, as well as the massive integration of evs are significantly transforming the state of traditionally passive, low-voltage parts of distribu\u2010 tion networks, and driving the need for systematic and intel\u2010 ligent management. thus, distribution utilities and especially operators and grid engineers, must adapt to the emerging conditions by learning and adopting new technologies for planning and managing evolving distribution networks with high penetra\u2010 tion of ders. traditional practices and procedures that are used for managing passive distribution networks, are already outdated and inapplicable to these emerging conditions. how\u2010 ever, derms can successfully cope with der-imposed chal\u2010 lenges and secure the systematic and intelligent management of a wide range of different ders. further, derms technol\u2010 ogies strive to turn the potentially dangerous behavior of ders into operational and monetary benefits for utilities, as well as end-customers [15]-[18]. but there are different lev\u2010 els to the derms hierarchy, which aim to provide different services regarding der management, while targeting differ\u2010 ent ders relative to their sizes and connection point loca\u2010 tions (on a medium- or low-voltage distribution network). our goal is to show how the integration of two of these solutions, located on the opposite ends of the hierarchical spectrum, namely utility derms and der aggregators, can work in coherence. by complementing each other, they can provide a required set of tools for the integration and active management of all types of ders, regardless of their tech\u2010 nology, size, or connection point location. iii. different der management solutions and their complementary natures this section introduces a derms concept and presents the nature and characteristics of utility derms and der ag\u2010 gregators and the benefits of their integration to dsos. a. derms and its usage as the derms concept is novel and still emerging, the term derms itself is still vague and may refer to different solutions. generally speaking, the term derms corresponds to a software solution for managing high penetration of ders. however, because of its novelty, derms is often used to describe various different levels of software solu\u2010 tions aimed for managing ders. on the one hand, there are decentralized software packag\u2010 es that aim to aggregate behind-the-meter ders such as air- conditioning or heating devices, rooftop pvs, small-scale bat\u2010 teries, or evs, with the main goal to provide a better aware\u2010 ness of these small-scale but very dispersed assets and to provide their services in an aggregated and much more use\u2010 ful manner, e.g., by entering the electricity market or by pro\u2010 viding dr and energy-efficiency programs, among others [15]-[19]. on the other hand, there are fully centralized en\u2010 terprise systems that aim to provide services to the dsos, to enable them to swiftly overcome the challenges that ders impose on the distribution networks and their assets. these services range from providing situational awareness to manu\u2010 al/automatic der control, constraint resolution, and ad\u2010 vanced optimization applications for the efficient manage\u2010 ment of medium- to large-scale ders and der groups con\u2010 sisting of numerous small-scale units, with the objectives to provide operational and monetary benefits to the grid opera\u2010 tors and engineers in the control room and to grid planners that are responsible for the network upgrades and the addi\u2010 tion of new resources [11], [15]. both utility derms and der aggregators are frequently called derms, but these two solutions differ widely in their nature and responsibilities considering the existing real- world solutions applied in north america and worldwide. one is a centralized enterprise system, which is completely grid-aware, whereas the other is usually implemented as a decentralized solution that is unaware or partially aware of the grid conditions and limitations and is concerned only with ders and their internal conditions and responsibilities. but these two solutions also complement each other in se\u2010 curing a full spectrum of services essential for today\u2019s dsos, who are responsible for ensuring the safe, reliable, and optimal management of an ever-increasing penetration of ders [15]. b. roles and responsibilities of der management solutions the main role of der aggregators is to provide the aggre\u2010 gation of small-scale ders into der groups, and conse\u2010 quently to enable their services using the aggregated der power. the added value provided by der aggregators in\u2010 cludes enabling the participation of small-scale ders in the electricity markets, the engagement of ders and prosumers in energy-saving and energy-efficiency programs, the provi\u2010 sion of dr and load shedding services, as well as other mostly customer-related services. however, because of their structure that is generally adopted nowadays, der aggrega\u2010 tors are either not aware or only partially aware of the grid model and its conditions and technical boundaries, so they cannot guarantee not causing technical constraint violations such as congestions, voltage violations, or protection issues. thus, to enable the safe use of the services offered by der aggregators, dsos must have observability of the real-time conditions in the grid, as well as the ability to validate\u2013and modify, if necessary\u2013the schedules of der aggregators to avoid constraint violations on the grid assets. this is where a utility derms comes into play. utility derms solutions are intelligent, grid-aware software pack\u2010 ages that enable the full awareness, control, and optimal management of medium- to large-scale ders and der groups (consisting of behind-the-meter ders), with the goal 279\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 4\\n\\njournal of modern power systems and clean energy, vol. 10, no. 2, march 2022 of using all these resources to achieve system-wide benefits without violating grid constraints. further, utility derms so\u2010 lutions use all available resources to solve existing violations or predicted constraint violations and keep the system in a stable and optimal state in real time. therefore, for large- and medium-scale ders, whose impact on the grid condi\u2010 tions can be significant, a grid-aware utility derms is a nat\u2010 ural solution for their management and control [11], [15]. even though both solutions are concerned with der man\u2010 agement, utility derms and der aggregators are vastly dif\u2010 ferent software packages, and thus they should not be re\u2010 ferred to by the same term. referring to both solutions as derms leads to confusion, even among parties interested in deploying derms (i.e., electric utilities), and thus it should be abandoned. from the standpoint of dso, utility derms and der aggregators should be understood as different lev\u2010 els in a hierarchy: der aggregators mainly communicate with behind-the-meter units and use them in an aggregated fashion to provide various services regarding customer en\u2010 gagement and operations. besides, utility derms uses der aggregators, among other resources such as individual medi\u2010 um- to large-scale ders, various types of der groups, vpps, microgrids, and traditional resources such as switches and capacitors, to provide dsos with a complete awareness as well as effortless, real-time, look-ahead constraint manage\u2010 ment and the optimal coordination and management of ders, der groups, and other system-wide operations. therefore, if properly integrated, a der aggregator and utili\u2010 ty derms can complement each other and provide a full spectrum of der services regarding both customer-related and grid-related operations, which is regardless of the sizes and locations of ders. c. integration of utility derms and der aggregators: an ideal case even though both a der aggregator and a utility derms can be used as a stand-alone solution and can successfully provide numerous benefits, their values are tremendously in\u2010 creased when they are integrated and used together. when they are properly integrated and set to work coherently, these two solutions can cover a full spectrum of der man\u2010 agement services and can open a new world of possibilities for dsos to use ders as valuable resources in performing a broad set of required operations, both grid-related and cus\u2010 tomer-related [15], [19]. through (near) real-time communications and data ex\u2010 change with a utility derms, der aggregators highly en\u2010 hance dsos\u2019 awareness of and ability to manage behind-the- meter ders, especially in customer-related operations such as participation in electricity market and dr or energy-effi\u2010 ciency schemes. nonetheless, through its advanced applica\u2010 tions such as hosting capacity, real-time and look-ahead con\u2010 straint management, volt/var/watt optimization, demand flexi\u2010 bility, load and der forecast, and through sophisticated inte\u2010 gration with der aggregators, utility derms enables dsos with an ability to successfully manage and optimize their emerging distribution systems with high penetration of differ\u2010 ent ders, which are dispersed throughout the grid (from be\u2010 hind-the-meter to large-scale ders connected to the medi\u2010 um-voltage distribution network) [19]. further, der aggregators, if integrated with a utility derms, would be able to provide a much better quality of their services because all their scheduled programs could be validated by a utility derms, therefore ensuring that none of the technical constraints are ever violated. hence, this in\u2010 tegration would ultimately lead dsos to a much-needed transformation into a new era of future distribution systems with high penetration of ders. near real-time communication in this context is envi\u2010 sioned through supervisory control and data acquisition (scada) and internet protocols, but can also be performed through custom-made application programing interfaces (apis). using custom-made apis is a current practice, as in many cases, a utility derms of the specific vendor on one side, and a der aggregator on the other side, do not support the same protocols. hopefully, this practice will soon change, as the standardization of the communication proto\u2010 cols is currently taking place, and for example, the ieee 2030.5 protocol is a very promising solution that could be useful on both ends. the information exchanged through this communication often consists of advanced metering infrastructure (ami) measurements that an aggregator collects for behind-the-me\u2010 ter resources, as well as forecasted production of small-scale ders controlled by der aggregators and their operation schedules. these data are then used in near real-time applica\u2010 tions of the utility derms, i.e., state estimation, to improve situation awareness, as well as in constraint management and grid optimization for near real-time and forecasted peri\u2010 ods. thus, not only the observability of the grid conditions in near real-time is significantly improved, but also the pre\u2010 dictions of the constraint violations can be performed with more accuracy and consequently they can be managed proac\u2010 tively. iv. real-life use cases for utility derms and der aggregators this section presents several real-life use cases that dem\u2010 onstrate the progression of different derms solutions all the way up to the integration of utility derms and der ag\u2010 gregators to provide benefits to dsos and end-customers. the following examples have already been tested or are cur\u2010 rently being tested in industrial and academic projects, using commercially available or prototype utility derms and der aggregator solutions. a. distribution voltage management and peak load reduc\u2010 tion through utility derms this use case demonstrates a utility derms that directly controls residential ders that are owned by the utility. these ders are aggregated and controlled as a vpp to pro\u2010 vide peak demand reduction while enforcing the voltage reg\u2010 ulation. this utility derms is a software prototype devel\u2010 oped by nrel [20] (originally referred as real-time optimal power flow) by using a feedback-based real-time optimiza\u2010 tion algorithm [21], [22]. a distribution feeder, located in colorado within the ser\u2010 vice territory of an electric utility in north america, is used 280\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 5\\n\\nstrezoski et al.: integration of utility distributed energy resource management system and aggregators for evolving... as the simulation test system in this study. there are 1137 residential loads modeled, of which 163 loads represent all- electric homes. these all-electric homes are assumed to have residential rooftop pv and battery energy storage system (bess) installed on their premises that participate in the vpp and voltage regulation controls through the utility derms. the experiments are conducted in the adms test\u2010 bed [14], [23], [24]. the testbed was developed by nrel and the u. s. department of energy\u2019s (doe\u2019s) office of electricity for vendor-neutral evaluation of distribution man\u2010 agement strategies and through that, to help accelerate ad\u2010 ms deployments among dsos. the testbed uses multi-times\u2010 cale simulation platforms of distribution system models, in\u2010 terfaced with physical hardware to represent real-world and hypothetical future system conditions. the testbed also has a communication interface that allows adms and other utility management systems such as derms to interface with the testbed using industry-standard protocols. nrel works with utility, industry, and other research groups, to identify and evaluate adms applications that are important for grid mod\u2010 ernization. the simulations for this use case are conducted on the adms testbed using the data from a representative peak load day on january 27, 2018. figure 1 shows the results from utility derms use case, including substation power, total bess power output, and average bess state of charge (soc). high load consumptions are observed during 07:00-08:00 and 17:00-23:00 for the baseline (no control) scenario. with besss controlled by the utility derms, they discharge pow\u2010 er to offset the high load consumptions during these periods and recoup the energy by charging in other periods. voltage regulation is implemented simultaneously by controlling the reactive power output of pv inverters. figure 2 shows the results of the system voltages and the active and reactive power outputs of pv inverters when pvs are controlled by the utility derms. reactive power support provided by pv inverters is used to mitigate over-voltage without causing pv curtailment. the negative pv reactive power

monitoring and control in emerging distribu\u2010 tion networks with large amounts of dispersed ders utility derms provides accurate situation awareness of real-time conditions in the grid to the operator, including voltages, current and power flows, and congestions, through scada and ami systems [13]. moreover, through sophisti\u2010 cated load and der forecast algorithms, accurate predictions of future grid conditions are estimated by utility derms systems; however, with the emergence of high penetration of behind-the-meter ders and flexible loads, which are fre\u2010 quently not connected to scada or ami systems, their con\u2010 ditions have traditionally been estimated using state estima\u2010 tion or other advanced applications [13], [15]. besides, der aggregators enable near real-time measurements of small- scale ders that are not connected to scada or ami as well as accurate forecasted behavior of der groups compris\u2010 ing these small ders. with these data being constantly im\u2010 ported from der aggregators, a utility derms increases the accuracy of the real-time situational awareness and ex\u2010 pands it to the grid-edge devices [13], [15]. this use case describes a study of the ability of der ag\u2010 gregator and adms (with utility derms functionalities) co\u2010 ordination to achieve situation awareness and voltage regula\u2010 tion in the presence of very high penetration of ders, using the nrel adms testbed [14], [24], [25]. when high pv generation is present, the voltage regula\u2010 tion is a major issue. this use case also demonstrates the ability of the real-time optimal power flow [20] introduced in section iv-a to coordinate with an adms to enforce the voltage regulation in the distribution feeders. specifically, the adms reduces the bus voltages to mitigate the voltage rise and the der aggregator dispatches the pv smart invert\u2010 ers to further resolve the voltage issues. this study models a set of four distribution feeders sup\u2010 plied by a 30 mva, 110 kv/13.2 kv substation transformer in opendss. the model is developed based on the data from a north american electric utility. the topology of this model is shown in fig. 3. the feeders, located in colorado, serve nearly 6000 customers and have more than 13000 bus\u2010 es. the substation transformer is equipped with a load tap changer (ltc). additionally, there are 13 switched capacitor banks with a total rating of 15.6 mvar available for voltage regulation and reactive power management. more than 3000 distributed pv systems are added to the model with a total rating of 24 mw (about 200% relative to the minimum load) to simulate a scenario with high pv penetration. the experiments for two scenarios are carried out, as de\u2010 scribed in [25], for 4 hours of simulation time to study the coordinated operation of the adms and der aggregator in accomplishing the voltage regulation. in the first scenario, re\u2010 ferred to as the baseline, the controls of the adms and der aggregator are turned off. the legacy devices (ltc and capacitor banks) follow their local controller responses and the pv smart inverters inject power at unity power fac\u2010 tor. the bus voltages from this scenario are shown in fig. 4(a). it is evident that many buses experience over-voltage issues, i.e., voltages above the upper voltage limit of american na\u2010 tional standards institute (ansi) (1.05 p.u.) during the simu\u2010 lated period. in the second scenario, referred to as the virtual reality (vr)-enabled scenario, the vvo of adms is enabled with the voltage regulation (customer voltage improvement) as the control objective. this study uses the adms developed by schneider electric [26]. the adms runs advanced model- based optimization using the vvo application to issue opti\u2010 mal set-points to the legacy devices, i.e., the ltc and capac\u2010 itor banks. since the scenario with high pv penetration in this use case considers residential rooftop pv systems only, they (pvs) are all assumed to be controlled by the der ag\u2010 gregator and not by the adms. the vvo of adms is config\u2010 ured to run every 5 min to issue the set-points to the legacy de\u2010 vices on the slow timescale. further, the real-time optimal power flow algorithm [27] is used to implement the der ag\u2010 gregator. the der aggregator commands are configured to run every 5 s to enforce the bus voltages to be within the limits using the reactive power compensation from the small-scale pv smart inverters and the active power curtailment, if needed. the results from the second scenario are shown in fig. 4(b)- (e). as observed in fig. 4(b), the adms reduces the ltc voltage regulation set-point to 119 v from the default ltc local controller set-point of 124 v during the initial few min\u2010 utes of the simulation. as a result, the ltc tap position is lowered to -5. consequently, the bus voltages are reduced and reasonably confined to the ansi voltage band from 0.95 p.u. to 1.05 p.u, as shown in fig. 4(d). thus, the voltage regulation is ensured despite the presence of high pv generation. the to\u2010 tal pv power outputs in both the scenarios are compared in fig. 4(e). as the pv inverters are not oversized, the der ag\u2010 gregator curtails the pv active power to allow reactive power absorption to regulate the voltage within operating limits. it is observed that approximately 9 kvar reactive power is absorbed by the pv smart inverters at around 10:00. c. utilizing ders to mitigate real-time constraint viola\u2010 tions after restoration of a de-energized island another related use case currently being tested by using the utility derms of schneider electric investigates how to optimally use ders to mitigate constraint violations after the restoration of a de-energized island [15]. feeder 1 feeder 3 feeder 2 feeder 4 substation switched capacitor primary network secondary network fig. 3. topology of studied model. 282\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 7\\n\\nstrezoski et al.: integration of utility distributed energy resource management system and aggregators for evolving... in a simulated environment, during the restoration of a de- energized island after a fault isolation, an overload is detect\u2010 ed at the beginning of the feeder, and an overload alarm ap\u2010 pears in the utility derms. it triggers a real-time constraint management application; and the application, among its re\u2010 sources for constraint resolution, detects a der group man\u2010 aged by a der aggregator consisting of batteries and solar pvs. the application computes the result that this der group can provide enough flexibility to mitigate the overload condition. the command is consequently sent to the der ag\u2010 gregator to increase the production of the resources in one of the der groups managed by it. finally, the der aggrega\u2010 tor dispatches the commands among its individual der as\u2010 sets to increase production and alleviate congestion. through the real-time measurements, the utility derms confirms that the overload issue is successfully mitigated, and the alarm disappears, informing the operator that the violation is successfully solved. d. participation of ders in electricity markets without vio\u2010 lating technical constraints in accordance with their integration with a day-ahead elec\u2010 tricity market, der aggregators determine schedules for their der groups. we propose that, to validate these sched\u2010 ules against technical constraints, der aggregators send these schedules to the utility derms. these schedules are considered within the look-ahead constraint management ap\u2010 plication of derms, which determines if some of the sched\u2010 ules would violate the technical constraints. therefore, for these der groups, modified schedules as well as the maxi\u2010 mum export and import limits are calculated within the derms and sent back to the der aggregators, along with the positive validations for the rest of the schedules that do not violate any constraint. the der aggregators accordingly modify the schedules for critical der groups, and it is final\u2010 ly ensured that all the new schedules are valid and safe to be implemented when the time comes. the integration of the utility derms and der aggregators is essential to effective\u2010 ly aggregate ders to provide bulk grid services [28]. a variation of this approach is a new grid control architec\u2010 ture, referred to as the federated architecture for secure and transactive distributed energy resource management solutions (fast-derms) [29], which is shown in fig. 5. it is current\u2010 ly under development and proposes a distribution utility derms, which consists of flexible resource schedulers (frss) and an frs coordinator. each frs schedules ders within a substation service area. the frs can control some ders, which may include a building (b) or microgrid (mg) directly and others through a der aggregator. yet others may be managed through a transactive market manager (tmm). the fast-derms project focuses on enabling scalable aggregation and near real-time management of utility-scale and small-scale ders through grid-aware, reliability-con\u2010 strained economic dispatch by the frs. it aims to support re\u2010 liable, resilient, and secure distribution and transmission net\u2010 work services. further, the advancements on multiple fronts, including communication standards, controls that effectively handle load and der uncertainties, transactive market struc\u2010 tures that ensure the protection of customer autonomy, der anomaly detection methods, and fail-safe der operating fig. 4. results from voltage regulation
