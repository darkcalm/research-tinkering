      "data of both the tertiary and secondary layer or either of them is completely delayed or lost for one der, the other ders would pick up this generation shortage, which is very similar to the situation that one der randomly disconnect from the network. please refer to the simulation results in fig.7 for the time period 1300s to 2100s as discussed earlier. moreover, even for the worst scenario that the generation data in both the tertiary and secondary layer is lost for all ders, the proposed three hierarchical framework would degrade into a primary frequency regulation layer only, which could also work but with the cost of non-zero frequency deviations. b. case 2: investigate the performance of proposed scheme in 33-bus network with practical load conditions in case 2, the following practical load conditions are settled to validate the performance of proposed scheme: 1) as shown in fig. 8, the predicted load demand and wind power generation are updated every 300s, and the real time wind power deviations for 3 wind farms (wfs) are generated based on the composite model consisting of the base, the ramp, the gust and the turbulence components [34, 35]; 2) in order to test the plug-in and play capability of proposed scheme, der11 is plugged out at 6000s and plugged in at 12000s. fig. 9 displayed how the 15 ders were coordinated by the proposed hierarchical scheme to match the real-time load demands and fluctuating wind power generation. as shown in fig.9a), the tertiary generation regulation layer economically dispatched the predicted load demand by admm with a time interval of 300s, while the secondary generation regulation layer further economically conducted generation corrections to timely counterbalance load deviations on top of the tertiary layer in fig.9b), and finally the 15 ders actual outputs are obtained in fig.9c). it is noteworthy that: 1) as der11 was disconnected during 6000s-12000s, the outputs of der11 quickly decreased to zero in fig.9a) to fig.9c), while for other 14 ders, their dispatched generations in the tertiary layer, the generation corrections in the secondary layer and their actual outputs obviously increased to a high level for making up the der11 generation loss; 2) during 6000s-12000s for der11 disconnection, as der1 is the most economical generator with the cheapest cost coefficients, its generation output increases extensively even that sometimes der1 approaches the power upper limit at 750kw. fig.9d) demonstrates the ess power outputs and the controllable load level, which indicate that their outputs are always quickly adjusted to counterbalance the frequency deviations. fig.8 load/wind prediction and actual deviations for 33-bus adpn a) base operation point in tertiary layer b) generation corrections in secondary layer\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 9\\n\\nc) der actual outputs d) energy storage outputs and controllable load demands fig.9 der outputs in 33-bus adpn with practical load conditions fig.10 frequency regulation in 33-bus adpn with practical conditions fig.10 further compared the frequency regulation performance for three different implementations: 1) the ed algorithm with der primary frequency droop control only; 2) the proposed three-layer hierarchical control scheme excluding the primary frequency droop control of ess and controllable load; 3) the proposed completed three-layer hierarchical control scheme. as illustrated by the red line in fig.10, the proposed distributed scheme could ensure the frequency deviations always in the vicinity of zero with occasionally slight fluctuations not exceeding 0.1hz. however, the scheme 1) would usually result in non-zero frequency deviations with the maximum as large as 0.3hz, while scheme 2) also has satisfied frequency regulation performance but worse than the performance of scheme 3). these comparisons demonstrated that for a adpn with fluctuating wind power generation, as der generation corrections (on top of the base point in tertiary layer) are conducted in the secondary layer to compensate the fluctuating wind power generation, scheme 2) and 3) can effectively improve the frequency regulation performance, while the later is the most outstanding one because there is plenty of ess and controllable load with good fast response capability. v. case study for 132-bus with large-scale ders to further investigate the effectiveness of proposed distributed hierarchical scheme to optimally coordinate large-scale ders, a 132-bus adpn is deployed with 60 ders and 12 wfs as shown in fig.11, which is formed by replicating the aforementioned 33-bus adpn four times with extra feeders between bus 33 and bus 1. the fuel cost coefficients (ai, bi, and ci ) of ders in area a are the same as those in case 1,while coefficients for other 45 ders are partially modified as follows: 1.2ai for ders in area b, 0.8bi for ders in area c and 1.5ai for ders in area d. the predicted load and wind power generation are similarly generated as that for 33-bus adpn with proportional modifications, which is indicated by the black line in fig. 12a). the wind power deviations and the ultimately resultant load demand are provided as the pink and green line in fig.12a). to observe the plug-in/out behaviors of ders, der1 in subsystem a is assumed to be plugged out at 9000s and plugged in at 15000s. ieee 33-bus system a ieee 33-bus system c ieee 33-bus system b ieee 33-bus system d 1 1 1 1 33 33 fig.11 structure of 132-bus adpn with 60 ders a) predicted load with total wind generation deviations b) base operation point in tertiary layer c) generation corrections in secondary layer d) der actual outputs\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 10\\n\\ne) es power outputs and controllable load demand fig.12 der outputs in 132-bus adpn with practical load conditions fig. 12b) to fig. 12d) demonstrated the optimized base operation point in tertiary regulation layer, the generation corrections in secondary regulation layer and the actual generation outputs of 60 ders solved by the proposed hierarchical scheme. as illustrated by these figures, the tertiary layer could effectively address the optimal base point according to the predicted load demand and wind power generation, while the secondary generation regulation layer could further economically conduct generation corrections on top of tertiary generation regulation, and finally the outputs of 60 ders are coordinated to match the real time load demands of 132-bus adpn as shown in fig. 12d). it is also noted that when der1 is disconnected during 9000s-15000s, the optimal generation base point in tertiary layer, the generation corrections of secondary layer and the actual generation outputs for der1 are all decreased to zero. and the proposed scheme is still effective to guide other 59 ders to seek the optimal outputs for minimizing the fuel cost and regulating system frequency well. as der41 is much cheaper than other ders, its generation output is very large and frequently restricted by the upper generation limit, while der7, 8, 9, 10, 34, 35, 37 and 39 etc. occasionally reach their lower generation limits during 7000s-14000s as shown in fig. 12d) because of their expensive marginal fuel costs. fig.12e) also demonstrates the ess power outputs and the controllable load level accordingly during the procedure of counterbalancing the frequency deviations. fig.13 frequency regulation performance for 132-bus adpn fig. 13 plotted the frequency deviations of 132-bus adpn for three different schemes: 1) the ed algorithm with der primary frequency droop control; 2) the proposed three-layer hierarchical control scheme without the primary frequency droop control of ess and controllable load; 3) the proposed completed three-layer hierarchical control scheme. it is evident that the proposed scheme 3) can effectively regulate the system frequency and the maximal frequency deviation is near zero as the blue line shown in fig. 13. however, the scheme 1) or 2) could only regulate the system at large non-zero frequency deviations. these simulation results demonstrated that the proposed scheme is the best one capable of effectively regulating the system frequency. vi. conclusion in this paper, a fully distributed three-layer control framework is proposed for the coordinated operation of multiple ders in adpn. based on the discrete finite-time consensus algorithm, a fully distributed dispatch scheme and a fair generation correction strategy are designed in the tertiary and secondary generation regulation layer respectively. while in the primary generation regulation layer, a frequency droop controller is presented to ensure ders outputs perfectly tracking the power reference of the tertiary and secondary layers, and ders with energy storage and controllable load could well maintain satisfactory system dynamic frequency in real time. tests on the modified ieee 33-bus and 132-bus adpn with large-scale ders have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme in optimally coordinating ders outputs, ensuring satisfactory system frequency and robustly accommodating uncertainties of ders. since the proposed fully distributed hierarchical scheme to exclusively regulate system frequency may result in operation constraint violations, such as violating the voltage or line capacity limits, further ongoing research would elaborately design an all-round distributed hierarchical scheme (e.g., based on fully distributed optimal power flow model) to simultaneously regulate system frequency and ensure static security of distribution networks. vii. acknowledgment the authors would like to acknowledge the support from department of electrical engineering, the hong kong polytechnic university for the start-up fund research project (1-ze68), hong kong research grant council for the research projects (25203917) and (15200418), and national natural science foundation of china for the research project (51807171). viii. reference [1] x. shen, m. shahidehpour, s. zhu, y. han, and j. zheng, \"multi-stage planning of active distribution networks considering the co-optimization of operation strategies,\" ieee trans. smart grid, vol. 9, no. 2, pp. 1425-1433, mar. 2018.

senior member, ieee, can wan, member, ieee, xi lu, ka wing chan, member, ieee, and bin zhou, senior member, ieee abstract\u2014in order to effectively accommodate large-scale ders in active distribution power networks, this paper proposes a fully distributed hierarchical framework to economically manage multiple ders within three layers: the tertiary, the secondary generation regulation layer and the primary frequency droop control layer. in the tertiary layer, a fully distributed dispatch strategy is designed to optimally allocate the active power base point of ders in a center-free manner, with total generation and load imbalance locally estimated by individual der using the discrete finite-time consensus algorithm. in the secondary layer, a distributed fair generation correction strategy is designed based on power sharing ratio to timely counterbalance the load deviations on top of the tertiary layer. in the primary layer, a droop controller is presented for der, battery energy storage and controllable load to maintain satisfactory system frequency performance. the proposed hierarchical framework is a fully distributed generation coordinating approach, which could optimally control active power outputs of multiple ders with the minimal cost while ensuring satisfactory system frequency, and is also robust to ders\u2019 uncertainties. case studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of proposed fully distributed hierarchical framework for optimally coordinating ders power outputs and regulating system frequency. index terms\u2014active distribution power network, distributed energy resources, hierarchical control framework, generation correction strategy i. introduction with the development of renewable energy generation technology, distributed energy resources (ders) such as wind power generation, photovoltaic power generation and gas-fired generation etc., are extensively integrated into distribution networks. this requires a change in the paradigm of distribution power network from conventional passive into active, thus resulting in the active distribution power network (adpn), in order to reduce the negative impacts of ders and effectively manage ders in a large scale [1]. in addition, current smart grid technologies such as the information and communication technology (ict) and the multi-agent technology make it possible to proactively coordinate ders operating in an optimal manner [2]. it is necessary to develop a general paradigm with suitable control strategies for the coordinated operation of ders to achieve better power quality and more economical operation for the whole network. conventional optimization methods for distribution network operation are mainly centralized, which rely on a powerful hub to collect global information of all components and conduct the computational procedure. however, because of the ever-growing penetration level and the distributed nature of ders, centralized strategies are going to encounter some technical challenges [3]. firstly, the large volume of data caused by ders\u2019 integration will result in the heavy computational burden and communication complexity of control center. then, the system is susceptible to single-point-failure. moreover, the plug-and-play operational requirements of ders are unable to be flexibly satisfied. therefore, the fully distributed strategies are preferred for their superiorities of scalability, sparse network, and improved resiliency to faults or unknown parameters [4, 5]. recently, some studies have applied distributed algorithms in solving economic dispatch (ed) problems [4, 5]. for instance, in [7] a decentralized ed approach was proposed based on generators\u2019 incremental costs and a leader agent was used to collect the global generation and load demand information for calculating the power mismatch. in [8] the average consensus strategy was used for the local estimation of power mismatch shared among distributed generators, and a novel distributed dispatch algorithm was established for solving the ed problem. in [9, 10], a fully distributed ed algorithm was proposed by using an additional innovation term to ensure that the power mismatch gradually approaches to zero. in [11], the consensus algorithm was hybrid with the alternating direction method of multipliers (admm) for solving the optimal power flow problem with demand response in a distributed manner. the above literatures mainly focused on applying distributed algorithms for off-line optimal operation of ders in tertiary generation regulation layer, while the off-line solutions are not suitable to be implemented for the real-time coordination of ders in distribution networks. as a complement to the off-line optimization in a single layer, some scholars have put forward the hierarchical control structure to address different requirements with different control hierarchy. for example, authors of [12] proposed a hierarchical control scheme to improve the system overall efficiency while considering the state-of-charge balance at the same time, while the secondary and tertiary control were implemented in a micro-grid central controller. in [13], a potential-function was used for the secondary and tertiary control of a micro-grid, and an all-round central controller was needed to communicate with all ders. besides of these centralized hierarchical control schemes for power system operation, some center-free hierarchical control strategies were also put forward. for instance, a decentralized hierarchical framework was proposed in [14] and [15] to optimize the charging process of pevs for frequency regulation in a competitive electricity market. in [16, 17], new distributed control strategies were established for both the frequency and voltage regulation of micro grids, in which only the localized information and nearest-neighbor communication were needed. dr. m. a. mahmud of [18] designed a nonlinear distributed controller capable of maintaining both active and reactive power balance to prevent overloading. further, the work in [19] is not only able to restore the system frequency and network voltage in a distributed manner but also ensure its reactive power sharing. however, the above works mainly perform the power quality regulation and solve the power sharing problem proportionally according to ders\u2019 power ratings, while the economical operation of the whole system is not taken into account and thus optimal power sharing cannot be achieved. motivated by the above works, this paper proposed a fully distributed hierarchical control framework for optimally coordinating ders operation in adpn by three layers. in the tertiary generation regulation layer, a fully distributed dispatch this is the pre-published version. the following publication s. xia, s. bu, c. wan, x. lu, k. w. chan and b. zhou, \"a fully distributed hierarchical

power base point of ders in a center-free manner. in the secondary generation regulation layer, a distributed fair generation correction strategy was proposed by using the dfca to counterbalance the load deviations in a shorter timescale on top of the tertiary generation regulation, which was also without relying on a central coordinator. collectively, the tertiary and secondary layers provided the primary control layer with active power tracking reference points. in the primary layer, by using locally measured frequency deviations, the power droop controller was designed for the fast acting devices including the ders, battery energy storages (ess) and the controllable load to maintain satisfactory frequency dynamic performance of adpn. in this way, all the three layers are designed to operate without a central coordinator and therefore a fully distributed hierarchical control framework is well established. the main contributions of this paper are as follows. 1) to accommodate the feature of highly penetrating and widely scattering ders, a fully distributed hierarchical framework without requiring a centralized coordinator, as comparisons to the centralized hierarchical framework in [12, 13] or decentralized one in [14, 15], is innovatively designed for adpn economical operation by using admm and dfca for the tertiary and secondary layer as well as the local droop controller for the primary layer, respectively. compared with ordinary consensus based admm for dc-opf problem [11], here the dfca is incorporated into admm for formulating an efficient distributed optimization algorithm with less complexity and good data privacy, which only needs very few iterations to calculate the power imbalances in tertiary layer compared with the ordinary consensus algorithm as demonstrated by fig.5. different from the conventional centralized generation correction approach implemented with a control center to collect fuel cost coefficients of all ders for calculating power participation factors [20], the dfca is utilized in this paper to form a distributed generation correction strategy and conduct the economical generation correction without any central controller in the secondary layer. 2) the proposed fully distributed framework could optimally control the active power output of multiple ders with the minimal cost under the fluctuating load condition, while ensuring satisfactory system dynamic frequency performance. compared with the distributed control scheme in [4, 16-19] to conduct the generation corrections according to its rated power, which neglected the economy of the generation corrections in the secondary layer, the proposed distributed approach utilizes the dfca to realize the economical generation corrections in the secondary layer and thereby the corporation of tertiary and secondary layer can obtain the real time optimal solution of ders outputs, which has been validated by the benchmark results of traditional centralized methods. (please refer to the table 1 in page 7). 3) the proposed hierarchical framework is robust to accommodate the complexities and uncertainties of ders, such as the random plug-in/out behaviors of ders. 4) comprehensive simulations on a distribution system with multiple ders have demonstrated that the proposed fully distributed hierarchical framework is effective to optimally coordinate the power output of ders and can well regulate the system frequency. the rest of this paper is organized as follows. the preliminary of ders\u2019 economically coordinated operation and the discrete finite-time algorithm are introduced in section ii, and then a fully distributed three-layer hierarchical control framework is designed in section iii. afterwards three case studies are conducted in section iv and v to validate the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical scheme, and the conclusion is drawn in the last section. ii. preliminary this section first presents the problem formulation of ders coordinated operation, and then the background of discrete time finite algorithm used for dispatching ders in the later section is introduced. it is also noted that the ramping constraints, startup/shutdown constraints etc. of ders could be readily handled by many techniques in a multiple timescale paradigm including the day-ahead security constrained unit commitment and the real time security constrained unit commitment (several hours ahead) [21, 22], these constraints are not considered in this paper due to the page limits and the focus of this research is to optimally coordinate ders operation for a short timescale, in specific from 5 minutes approaching the real time. a. problem"
