      "communication, leadership, decision-making and situational awareness; \u2018situational factors\u2019 are those found in the immediate work environment such as time pressures, information flows, poor procedures, and the design of human-system interfaces; whilst \u2018organisational factors\u2019 include the presence of early warning or defensive systems, the contribution made be incident reporting and the extent of organisational redundancy. vincent et al (1998) have added to this categorisation to\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 6\\n\\n6 suggest that the threats to patient safety are brought about by even wider socio- organisational factors, including the \u2018institutional context\u2019 of health care politics and policy, together with a broader understanding of \u2018organisational and managerial factors\u2019 that considers in the wider role of management planning and organisational cultures. in policy, these ideas are articulated as \u2018root cause analysis\u2019, the philosophy by which the service should seek out the threats to patient safety to make service improvement, principally through participating in the new systems of incident reporting and risk management found in the nrls and then identifying the underlying latent factors that threaten safety. although the prevailing \u2018systems approach\u2019 certainly moves beyond an individualised \u2018person-centre\u2019 understanding of human error (reason, 2000), its predominant focus remains at the micro level of individual or group performance. mezzo and macro level issue",
      "communications (items or information with the incorrect content) or missing transactions (where items fail to be exchanged). each of which can be seen as framed by the complex tasks carried out by each department and also their high degrees of inter-dependency.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 15\\n\\n15 the operating department\u2019s relationship with the surgical wards was the most frequent site for systemic failure. for two thirds of the scheduled operations we observed delays in the scheduled transfer of the patient from the surgical ward to the operating department of between 5 and 20 minutes. these were typically the result of competing tasks, staff shortages and technical difficulties within the wards. we also found that interactions between the operating department and the surgical ward were characterised by missing information, such as the patient\u2019s signed consent form, whilst on a number of occasion patients were brought to theatre without being appropriately prepared for surgery, for example, they were still wearing jewellery or dentures, or had not been given the appropriate sedatives. \u201cyou phone up at 8.00am and say \u2018so and so, and so and so need to be ready\u2019, [but] you can send for your first one and you can find that the porter has gone to the ward and they are not ready, their bloods are not done, there are problems with consent, big issues that delay things.\u201d (p8) the collection of post-operative patients for their return to the ward also incurred frequent delays, with about one quarter of these transfers between the operating department and the ward delayed in excess of 15 minutes. this had the effect of blocking beds on the department\u2019s recovery unit, where post-operative patients received specialist care whilst recovering from the anaesthetic and surgery, and created log jams in the flow of departmental work. on a number of occasions where ward staff were absent or excessively delayed, recovery nurses were required to leave designated duties in order to transfer the patients to the ward thereby leaving the unit short of staff.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 16\\n\\n16 \u201cwe have had to wait 40 minutes sometimes for the ward staff to collect the patients. i know they are busy and everything, but it blocks our beds and effects how we work\u2026we have had to take some of the patients back ourselves but then you have the problem of being a staff member down\u201d (recovery nurse: field notes) for patients needing intensive post-operative care, theatre staff, typically the theatre sisters, were required by departmental policy to request and secure a specialist bed within the hdu, before commencing surgery. although these were often reserved several hours or days in advance of the operation, based upon the scheduled list of procedures, we found that around half of those operations needing this type of post-operative care were delayed in their start by between 10 and 40 minutes because a hdu bed could not be guaranteed. the time in which these delays were most common was early in the morning, especially mondays as the hdu dealt with weekend emergencies. on two occasions we also recorded how an pre-arranged and guaranteed hdu bed became occupied by another patient mid-way through the surgical procedure, which resulted in the designated surgical patient being deprived of this specialist bed for over 30 minutes, during which time the post-operative patient remained anaesthetised in the operating theatre until a bed was made available, but this introduced further risks to patient care and the planned work of the operating department. where delays were expected to be long surgical staff would suggest re-arranging the order of patients or cancelling the operation, which further introduced further complications in the work of the operating department. \u201cwe had one case where somebody was cancelled because there was no hdu bed, so just one of the resources was not there, and the patient went home with a new date organised and died in between.\u201d (p42) the relationship with ssu could also affect the workings of the operating department. the provision of surgical instrumentation was based upon the designated schedule of surgical procedures, whereby the appropriate instrumentation \u2018tray\u2019 would be sterilised and made ready for use before being transported to theatre. it was expected that\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 17\\n\\n17 instrumentation would be delivered in advance of the surgical start time to enable nursing staff to complete all necessary checks and preparations. however, for a significant number of operations the delivery of this equipment was often delayed due to staff shortages, equipment failure or time pressures within ssu. we recorded that these delays rarely occurred early in the mornings as ssu was able to clean and prepare equipment \u2018out of hours\u2019, but it struggled to turn-around instruments within a short time period between similar procedures. furthermore, on a small number of occasions instrumentation was brought to the operating department which was either incorrect or faulty, indicating shortcomings in the capacity for this department to clean and check surgical equipment thoroughly, which was often seen as the result of staff shortages. again these problems placed further time and resource pressures on work in the operating department. \u201cwe have just sent two health care assistants to ssu to collect the trays, they are short of staff and can\u2019t cope\u2026we often help out\u2026we need to if we want to get on with the list\u201d (theatre sister: field notes) \u201c[its important]\u2026all the instruments are sterile, i mean yes, we do get instances where we don\u2019t have the right tackle available, or we have malfunctioning equipment.\u201d (p53). we observed that the relationships with histopathology and radiographic services also had the potential to undermine the workings of the operating theatre, although to a lesser extent than some of the other departments. we found that delayed, missing or incorrect exchanges of information, such as blood supplies, test results and x-rays could seriously undermine and impair anaesthetic and surgical decision-making during or immediately prior to the start of an operation. from our observations of anaesthetic work we recorded that about a quarter of anaesthetists experienced some form of delay for pathology results, and on a small number of occasions the late delivery of x-rays or other scans impeded surgical activity. more significantly on two occasions we recorded how the wrong test results were delivered to the operating department. in most cases it appeared\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 18\\n\\n18 that the tests and x-rays in question were generated by last minute requests for information. \u201canother issue is with pre-operative blood test which may not be available. one of the lists i do is a renal list and the patient should have the potassium levels measures\u2026but sometimes the potassium is not available.\u201d (p20) \u201cwe have had to delay surgery for several hours because there is no blood available\u201d (p29) \u201cthe great urological example is the surgeon who took the wrong kidney out, you have x-rays not available, x-rays wrongly marked, people making assumptions.\u201d (p54) given the operating department\u2019s function dependence on these inter-departmental relationships such \u2018breakdowns\u2019, either as delayed, missing or incorrect exchanges constituted significant problems to the effective and safe delivery of surgical care, as the network of organisational interactions would fracture and de-align from what was scheduled. returning to our earlier analysis it was apparent that each of these specialist departments experienced certain failures of problems in completing their tasks, often associated with the endemic problems of resource constraint and competing demands, but because of the tight coupling between departments, these rarely remained isolated within each department but instead combine and spread across the wider organisation manifest as organisational breakdowns, and influencing the work of the operating department at the hub of this network. \u201cwell the organisation is chaotic, and in a chaotic organisation risk is always there\u2026there is no order\u2026. at the moment it is like concorde is about to take off in three minutes, so you are on the flight deck and you suddenly think have we put all the petrol in, the pilot isn\u2019t here, where\u2019s the food!\u201d (p19)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 19\\n\\n19 the impact on the operating department and patient safety many of these organisational breakdowns were small in character and isolated to a single inter-departmental exchange, having little impact upon the overall workings of the operating theatre at the centre of this hospital network. typically they introduced slight adjustments to the start and finish times of the surgical procedures as delayed, missing or incorrect exchanges were rectified. our observations indicated that staff working in the \u2018theatres\u2019 had learnt to cope with many of these problems, whilst in some cases one problem could coincidently offset or compensate for another. for example, the delayed arrival of a patient from the surgical ward could give the theatre staff additional time to complete instrumentation checks, or the wait for a guaranteed hdu bed often gave the anaesthetists extra time to acquire missing test results. on many occasions staff also used these situations to take missed breaks or talk with colleagues. we found therefore that in both organisational and cultural terms the operating department had come to expect, tolerate and work with many of these problems. we also noted, however, that because staff had come to expect and accept many of these situations this had the perverse effect of further undermining the smooth running of theatres as some staff members, especially surgeons, would often arrive late to the operating department assuming that the scheduled start time would already be postponed. nevertheless, these breakdowns did have a negative impact on the provision of surgical care, especially when key resources failed to arrive or were delayed in excess of 20 minutes. furthermore, these breakdowns could have a cumulative effect as one inter- departmental relationship fractured, for example between theatres and the ward, this could further de-align relationships with other departments, such as between theatres and hdu, leading to increased change and uncertainty across the wider system. this seemed to indicate that despite weekly management planning, the organisation of this network was inflexible to the changes and problems that often emerged within any one relationship. we found that during these periods the operating department was characterised by high degrees of constraint (time, resource or emotional pressure), change\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 20\\n\\n20 (as plans were modified to accommodate constraint) and uncertainty (as staff struggled to understand what these changes involved). these situations could have a profound effect on the delivery of surgical care through negatively influencing individual and group work within and around the operating theatre. perhaps the most obvious consequence of these breakdowns was the introduction of constraint and pressure in the work of the operating theatre. this was typically found in two ways, time pressures brought about by delays or changes to the scheduled theatre timetable, and resource constraints as staff were forced to work in sub-optimal conditions. time pressures were brought about by delayed inter-departmental exchanges or during the periods when missing or incorrect exchanges were rectified. at first these situations would enable staff to complete other tasks more thoroughly, for example, nurses would have greater preparation time and surgeons could attend to \u2018paperwork\u2019. however, these situations would invariably postpone the scheduled time of a procedure and when the missing, delayed or incorrect resources were remedied there was greater pressure on staff to work more quickly with the intention of making up \u2018lost time\u2019. this could be seen with all staff groups increasing the pace at which they worked. for example, anaesthetic staff would often comment informally on the pressures to prepare and anaesthetise the patient quickly, whilst for the surgeon, it was recorded how time constraints placed pressure on them to \u2018close\u2019 and finish the procedure more rapidly thereby saving or making time. \u201ci think it is putting more stress on the individual practitioner because they don\u2019t have enough time to make a careful enough assessment of patients before they start because of this pressure\u201d (p15) \u201cthere are time factors because you have got a set period of time to do the anaesthesia and you have got a list with a set number of patients on and you have got to make sure those two things fit together\u201d (p21)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 21\\n\\n21 these situations were seemingly made worse when incorrect or delayed resources could not be rectified. in some observations the nature of the missing resource meant that the operation was cancelled, for example with unavailable hdu beds or malfunctioning instrumentation. in other, less severe, cases these shortcomings seemed to make it more difficult for theatre staff to complete their work, for example we observed several instances of surgeons improvising with equipment, \u2018making do\u2019 with what was available, rather than cancel or change the theatre schedule. where certain resources were unavailable or delayed by over 30 minutes the pressure to work faster or improvise was replaced by the need to change the planned schedule of work. this would either involve switching the order of patients within one operating session or postponing the operation until another day. one of the most common sources of change was due to the lack of hdu beds, whereby the planned procedure would be re- arranged for later in the day or week when a bed would be available. however, other inter-departmental problems could also necessitate change, for example a patient inadvertently being given food on the surgical ward thereby preventing aneasthesia. these changes were often made on the assumption that it was not just technically necessary but also safer to change the planned procedure. however, these changes, often made at the last minute, introduced a range of additional pressures and difficulties into the ways in which the wider system functioned and \u2018theatre\u2019 staff worked. in particular changes to the scheduled order of operations could de-align other planned inter- departmental exchanges arranged for other operations within the same day, for example, in one of our observations the first patient of the day was cancelled due to the lack of hdu beds with the second planned patient being brought forward in the surgical list, but the resources needed for this procedure, such as test results and equipment, were not in place because they had been planned for a later time. these situations therefore created their own problems as the wider inter-departmental network of supplies and resources were not geared up to these last minute changes, further exacerbating the delays, time constraints and the uncertainty of work. specifically, staff seemed to be unsure about what they were supposed to be doing, and struggled to make sense of and bring order to a rapidly changing work environment.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 22\\n\\n22 \u201crisk comes along when things are changed at fairly short notice and i think one of our big risks is actually the operating list itself, [when] the list has changed, the patients have changed order or you have sent for a patient off one list and then the porter will come back with the wrong patient\u201d (p8) \u201canother safety issue is changes to the operating theatre list order\u2026this is a huge safety issue",
