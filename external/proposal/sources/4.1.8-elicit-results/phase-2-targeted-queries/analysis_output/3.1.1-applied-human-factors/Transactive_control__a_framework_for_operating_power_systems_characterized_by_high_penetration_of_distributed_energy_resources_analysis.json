      "communication technology (ict). it is likely that the electrical power system will evolve into a hybrid system in the next 20 years, with a set of primary generation, storage, and transmission systems coordinated through the market, and a set of distributed resources managed on a decen- tralized basis, using a mechanism that can leverage the capabilities of der systems [8]. the control and coordi- nation of a large number of distributed energy resources requires innovative distributed approaches. transactive control is such an approach. transactive control is a form of market-based control that has been adopted by several projects and initiatives [14, 15]. the intent of transactive control is to reach equilibriums by standardizing a scalable, distributed mechanism via exchanging information about generation, consumption, constraints, and responsive assets over dynamic, real-time forecasting periods, using economic incentive signaling [16], and thus solving complex power system problems. in another words, the operation is based on the management of interactions instead of actions. this paper reviews the recent development in transac- tive control application, and illustrates that as a framework which can be applied generally to the operation of power systems characterized by a high penetration of distributed energy resources. by reviewing the existing demonstration projects and literature, and presenting illustrative case studies, the paper classi\ufb01es the implementing methods of transactive control by way of information exchange between the involved actors and the operational purpose. furthermore, the research challenges faced by the appli- cation of transactive control in future power systems are discussed. the remainder of the paper is organized as follows: concepts and main methods of transactive control are introduced in section 2. section 3 reviews the literature that applies to the transactive control framework to manage distributed energy resources. in section 4, demonstration projects are described. section 5 presents two case studies using the transactive control framework. research chal- lenges are discussed in section 6. finally, a discussion and conclusion are given in section 7. 2 transactive control in smart grids 2.1 basic concept a transaction is an exchange of goods, services and/or funds through negotiation. accordingly, transactive control is a framework that enables actors to interact with each other through an economic signal, in order to optimize the allocation of resources. in [14], transactive control is de\ufb01ned as an implementation of transactive energy. transactive energy is \u2018\u2018a set of economic and control mechanisms that allows the dynamic balance of supply and demand across the entire electrical infrastructure using value as a key operational parameter\u2019\u2019 [14]. in a transactive energy-management system, mid- to small-sized electric- ity-consuming or producing devices automatically negoti- ate their actions with each other, with devices in the physical network, and with dispatch systems of energy suppliers through ef\ufb01cient and scalable electronic mar- ket algorithms [17]. in fact, transactive control is already in use in some wholesale energy markets in the world, for instance the nord pool spot market [18]. the trading and clearing mechanism used in the market is a typical form of trans- active control. however, the application of transactive control is still largely missing in distribution system operation and at the retail market level. in the transactive control framework, the utility function applied in microeconomics is used, and describes the degree of well-being the product provides for consumers. it thus de\ufb01nes the different responses of different devices to various prices [19]. as a framework, its application in power systems can be classi\ufb01ed into the following aspects, which will be discussed further in sections 3 and 4. 1) frequency regulation via tertiary control [20]. 2) frequency control in power systems via secondary control [19]. 3) congestion and voltage management in distribution network [7, 21\u201323]. 4) manage the energy distribution inside an operation of balance responsible parties (or aggregators) [24, 25]. 452 junjie hu et al. 123\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 3\\n\\n5) distribution system operation in term of in\ufb02uencing the behaviors of the decision-makers connected on the network [26]. 6) new electricity spot market mechanism that facilitates the participation of \ufb02exible demand [27, 28]. 7) residential optimal energy management considering network operational constraints of utility [29\u201331]. 2.2 time scale in transactive control, one of the main ideas is to inte- grate retail and wholesale markets, and other markets, into a single platform, by utilizing forward and spot transac- tions, thereby guiding investment and operating decisions [32]. forward transaction is used to coordinate investment decisions and manage risks. spot transaction is used to coordinate operating decisions and mitigate risk. the time scale of these two type transactions is shown in fig. 1. forward transactions are not new compared to the current market mechanism. however, the spot could be real time, or close to real time, e.g., 5 minutes. in the demonstration projects described in section 4, a 5-minute market is widely used. 2.3 implementing methods in general, two types of implementing methods are widely used in the literature, and in the demonstration projects that will be introduced in sections 3 and 4. the implementing method is de\ufb01ned as a way to \ufb01nd the equilibrium among the actors, and thus complete the transactions. these two kinds of approaches include: 1) a one-time information exchange-based method, such as the merit-order-based market-clearing mechanism. 2) an iterative information exchange-based method that, mathematically, is normally explained by dual decom- position computing algorithms. in the demonstration projects, the one-time information exchange-based method is widely applied. each participator generates a bid (a quantity and a price) for every bid period (e.g., 5 minutes), and communicates with the aggregating entity. figure 2 shows an example of the method to solve a grid congestion problem. three steps are included in the transactive control. firstly, each device (or device agent) bids their available \ufb02exibility to the aggre- gating entity (system operator in this case). then, the system operator aggregates the bids and performs a price- discovery mechanism; i.e., a merit-order-based market- clearing mechanism to \ufb01nd the clearing price. the cleared price is used to control the devices. we note that merit- order-based market-clearing mechanism is widely used to \ufb01nd the price, and to realize the transactions in the demonstration projects. besides the one-time information exchange, an iterative information exchange-based method is also widely pro- posed that normally exploits the algorithms of dual decomposition [34, 35]. note that in transactive control framework, the dual variables are normally interpreted as prices that re\ufb02ect the equilibriums, while in many studies they only serve as the coordinating signals [34, 35]. fig- ure 3 illustrates the scheme of the method. examples are given in the \ufb01gure where the interaction between system operator/aggregators and aggregators/der units are pre- sented. note that the upper-level entity sends the price to the lower-level entity; in correspondence, the lower level responds with its power schedules. after certain iterations, an agreement is reached between the upper-level entity and the lower-level entity. in our view, the upper-level entity decides when to stop based on its operational purpose. note that the key difference between these two approaches is the information exchange timing. the one- time information exchange-based method is less complex, leading to lower communication requirements and higher scalability. the iterative information exchange-based method can present actors more opportunity to exchange their operational conditions and willingness, but may need more time to reach equilibriums. in practical applications, the iterative information exchange-based method is expected to be useful in the scheduling phase, while the one-time information exchange-based method is more suitable of the real-time control phase. 3 literature review regarding application of transactive control in smart grids this section overviews the studies that apply the trans- active control framework for managing distributed energy resources with different purposes in smart grids. in [7], the transactive control method is applied to solve distribution network grid congestion between the distribu- tion system operator and the

operators (fo) generate optimal charging schedules, based on the energy spot price. how- ever, the sum of the charging schedule of all the fos may bring operational challenges to the dso, and thus it needs to be modi\ufb01ed. then, a \ufb02exibility cost function of fo is formulated that re\ufb02ects the charging power deviation from the scheduled charging power in the form of a quadratic function. the overall objective is to minimize the \ufb02exi- bility cost function of ev fos with respect to the grid capacity constraints. the minimization is formulated as a lagrange problem, and solved iteratively using a decom- position algorithm. the lagrange multipliers are inter- preted as congestion price that coordinates the ev fo\u2019s charging pro\ufb01les. furthermore, the study is extended in [21] to solve the voltage-band violations by introducing congestion prices at the buses level. in [22], ipakchi pointed out that a higher penetration of distributed energy resources will require greater attention to distribution congestion issues, and a need for improved distribution-automation and distribution-management capabilities. a transactive control approach is proposed to solve these problems. in the example described in the paper, a plug-in electric vehicle requests 7.8 kwh of charging energy over the next two hours. this request can be presented as a demand transaction and sent to a demand-side management application operated by the utility. knowing the transaction delivery point to which the car charger is connected, this application will check the available capacity of the low-voltage distribution transformer and feeders. then it determines whether the additional load will impact the circuit reliability and cause any adverse phase imbalances. the demand-side man- agement system will then schedule the charging for the requested time period. at the same time, the management system may receive many more charging requests that have to be checked and coordinated with wholesale scheduling at the substation supplying the feeders, to ensure adequate supply. each of these actions could be modeled as a transaction among the consumers, the util- ity, and suppliers. besides the application of congestion and voltage management [7, 21, 22] in the distribution system, a con- ceptual framework of using transactive control is proposed in [26] that aims to optimally coordinate the operation of self-interested individual decision-makers that emerge in the distribution system. the optimal operation of the grid is described according to a set of prede\ufb01ned technical and economic targets, and can be achieved by in\ufb02uencing the behaviors of the decision-makers with appropriate market signals. in the study, the authors argue that complex system theory can be used to support the framework. in addition, a price-response device control customer price-flexibility curve load (kw) price ($/kwh ) price ($/kwh ) price ($/kwh ) load

\ufb01nite horizon dynamic game (or a transactive control system) to opti- mally control the charging pro\ufb01le of a large number of electric vehicles. within the game, the control objective is to minimize electricity-generation costs by establishing an ev charging schedule that \ufb01lls the overnight demand val- ley. moreover, the paper established a suf\ufb01cient condition under which the system converges to the unique nash equilibrium. in order to implement the transactive control system, an iterative algorithm for computing the unique nash equilibrium is proposed, which includes four steps: step 1: the utility broadcasts the forecast of base demand to all the evs. step 2: each of the evs proposes an optimal charging strategy that minimizes its charging cost, with respect to a common aggregated ev demand broadcasted by the utility. step 3: the utility collects all the optimal charging strategies proposed by the individual evs, and updates the aggregated ev demand to all evs. step 4: repeat step 2 and step 3 until the optimal strategies proposed by all evs no longer change. a similar study performed in [37] proved that a trans- active control-based algorithm converges to optimal charging pro\ufb01les, irrespective of the speci\ufb01cations of evs, even with asynchronous computation. besides, the authors also extended the algorithm to track a given load pro\ufb01le and to real-time implementation. furthermore, in [38], the study deals with more loads in a multiple residence setup. the study \ufb01nds the social-welfare maximization for energy scheduling, between a utility company and residential energy-users. the problem is solved by a distributed sub- gradient method that can be supported by an advanced metering infrastructure (a two-way communication network). in addition to optimally managing the residential energy of a utility [36\u201338], the study in [29] suggested a two-stage residential energy-management method that considered network operational constraints. in the \ufb01rst stage, a day- ahead pricing scheme and residential appliance scheduling are determined through the interaction of the utility com- pany and residential customers. in the second stage, prices are updated based on the actual residential loads that draw lessons from the locational marginal price (lmp) used in the transmission system. in addition, in [30, 31], transac- tive control is used to coordinate the thermostatic loads with the purpose of realizing ef\ufb01cient energy allocation, subject to peak energy constraint (feeder capacity con- straints described in the study). in [24], a scalable three-step approach for demand-side management of evs is presented. the three steps consist of aggregation, optimization, and control. in the aggregation step, individual ev charging constraints are aggregated upwards. in the optimization step, the aggregated con- straints are used for the scalable computation of a collec- tive charging plan, which minimizes costs for the electricity supply. in the real-time control step, the objec- tive to divide the optimal power generated in step 2 between the individual evs, is determined by a market- based priority scheme. the work is further developed in [25], where an event-driven dual coordination mechanism is presented at the real-time control level. the simulation result indicated that the number of messages exchanged with the evs was signi\ufb01cantly reduced, by at least 64%. in [23], the transactive control framework is proposed to manage the charging of electric vehicles, and incorporates a distribution transformer and voltage constraints. a hier- archical multi-agent structure was used in the study, con- sisting of an auctioneer agent, substation agent, and ev device agent. the substation agent summed up the bid functions of all the underlying devices in a low-voltage network, and in turn sent the bid function to a unique auctioneer agent who de\ufb01ned the equilibrium price. in addition, the substation agent also ensured that the grid constraints were not violated, given the possible equilib- rium price. in [19], the auction-based transactive control is applied to control the cluster of loads with the purpose of providing spinning reserves. firstly, each device de\ufb01nes a utility function for the utilization of the power \ufb02exibility; e.g., the corner price model developed in [24] is applied to calculate the bid function of an ev. then, in real-time operation, all the device agents send their bids to a concentrator agent or \ufb02eet operator agent. the concentrator agent sums up the bid functions of their zone, and then sends the aggregated bid function to a unique auctioneer agent. finally, the auctioneer agent will de\ufb01ne the equilibrium price as the intersection of the aggregate bid functions and the supply bid function. after the equilibrium price is de\ufb01ned, it is sent back to all of the devices agents, and the corre- sponding power of the device agents will be determined. the market-clearing takes place every 15 minutes, or can be made event-driven. furthermore, the transactive control method is extended to cooperate in frequency reserve markets. in [20], a hierarchical transactive control architecture combines market transactions at the tertiary level with inter-area and unit-level control at the primary and sec- ondary level. the purpose of the hierarchical transactive control is to ensure frequency regulating, using optimal allocation of resources in the presence of uncertainties in renewables and load. models and controllers developed at the tertiary level follow the standard market-clearing pro- cedure that aims at social-welfare maximization. the transactive control: a framework for operating power systems\u2026 455 123\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 6\\n\\nproblem is solved iteratively, and the global asymptotic stability of the overall system is established. in [27, 28], a novel day-ahead pool market mechanism is proposed, to facilitate the participation of \ufb02exible demand in the electricity market. in the study, the market-clearing optimization problem is, \ufb01rstly, converted from a social- welfare maximization problem to an equivalent generation cost-minimization problem, and then solved indirectly by its lagrangian dual problem. the mathematical decompo- sition scheme is interpreted as a two-level iterative market- clearing mechanism, with the elements of lambda repre- senting the 24-hour electricity price. the proposed market mechanism is demonstrated with electric vehicles and heat- pump systems. in summary, a key operational parameter used in trans- active control is value (i.e., cost/utility functions in [7, 19, 21\u201325, 36, 37]). thereafter the equilibrium price can be discovered and the transaction can be executed. it is seen that iterative information exchange is required to reach equilibriums between the \ufb02eet operator and electric vehicles in [7, 21, 36, 37], while only one-time information exchange is required in [19, 21\u201325] to reach the equilibrium. the aforementioned studies are summarized in table 1. 4 demonstration projects in us and europe in this section, four demonstration projects are brie\ufb02y introduced: the grisewise olympic peninsula project, the paci\ufb01c northwest demonstration project, and the grid- smart demonstration project from the usa; and the powermatching city project from europe. the summary of demonstration project using transactive control framework is shown in table 2. gridwise olympic peninsula project [39]: the project adopted transactive control to coordinate the power use of residential electric water heaters and thermostats, commercial building-space conditioning, municipal water pump loads, and several distributed generators, with the purpose of reducing stress on local distribution networks. the \ufb01eld demonstration took place in washington and oregon, and was paid for by the u.s. department of energy and several northwest utilities. real-time price at 5-minute intervals was found to be an effective control signal for managing distribution congestion. peak loads were effectively reduced on the experimental feeder. the paci\ufb01c northwest demonstration project [40]: the project expanded upon the experience of the previously described gridwise olympic peninsula project. this pro- ject provided two-way communication between distributed generation, storage, and demand assets, and the existing gird infrastructure. the purpose was to use and test the tranactive control signal. the signals communicated the cost of delivering energy to a speci\ufb01c location. using automated controller, the devices such as water heaters, electric furnaces etc. could make their own decision when to use electricity. gridsmart demonstration project [41]: the project aimed to design, build, and operate a transactive control system, to engage residential consumers and their end-use resources, to address the local-scale grid congestion. the method has the advantage of providing greater ef\ufb01ciency under normal operating conditions, and greater \ufb02exibility to react under situations of system stress. three main aspects were studied: the impact on system operations, and on households, and observations about the sensitivity of load to price changes. powermatching city [42]: powermatching city is a living lab environment based on state-of-the-art off-the- shelf consumer products that have been altered to provide \ufb02exibility, and allow coordination with the smart grid [43]. the technology used in the project is powermatcher [44]; a \u2018demand response\u2019 technology that balances all smart

\ufb01rst phase of the demonstration, pow- ermatching city consisted of 22 common dutch house- holds, located near the city of groningen, in the netherlands. later, this number was scaled up further. the houses were \ufb01tted with either a domestic combined heat and power unit (micro-chp) or a heat pump with a gas- \ufb01red heater [45]. some households also contained intelli- gent white-good appliances, and electric vehicles were integrated as well. outside the district, a 2.5 mw wind turbine was available. the output power of the wind tur- bine could be scaled down digitally to match the con- sumption of the households. all devices were interfaced with powermatcher software, to operate powermatching city as a virtual power plant (vpp). it was concluded that the vpp successfully followed its optimized energy pro\ufb01le, and provided the required regulatory power at the same time [46]. 5 case studies as the market adoption of der reaches regional scale it will create signi\ufb01cant issues in the management of the distribution system related to existing planning and control. this is likely to lead to problems for power quality and reliability, since integrating distributed resources into wholesale markets, without aligning distribution control schemes, may create unacceptable consequences. further- more, as discussed in [10], as distributed energy resources increase, the need to balance these resources across the distribution system will likely give rise to the development of a distribution system control tier, to complement the bulk power system control tier. thus,inthisstudy,wepresenttworelevantcasestudiesthat apply transactive control framework at the distribution system level. the \ufb01rst case gives a brief overview of the developed work [7], where distribution congestions are solved by a transactive control framework. in the second case, a transac- tive control is applied to manage the distribution system bal- ance dynamically between supply and demand. to apply the transactive control in both case studies, a software agent (either an aggregator in section 5.1 or a local device agent in section 5.2) will be present to rep- resent the der\u2019s operational \ufb02exibility. the agent will form a cost function (section 5.1) or a walrasian demand function (section 5.2) to characterize the \ufb02exibility. these functions are bid into a virtual market where the equilib- rium will be found among the agents. the conditions of the equilibrium\u2019s existence depend on the convexity of the cost functions or the monotonicity of the demand functions. more assumptions and conditions of applying transactive control method are presented in section 6. 5.1 distribution grid congestion management considering electric vehicle integration in this case, we use electric vehicles as an example to be integrated in the distribution system. figure 4 shows that the system consists of three actors: distribution system operator, aggregators, and electric vehicle owners located in a low-voltage network. in this system, we assume aggregator manage the charging schedule of electric vehicles centrally, with the purpose of procuring the electricity from a spot market in a low-price period, and fulling the energy requirements of ev charging. however, if all the evs are charged in the low-price period, the aggregated power may introduce a congestion problem into the distribution network. thus, transactive control will be used between the dso and the aggregator to coordinate the power schedules. in [7] and [21], a \ufb02exibility cost function that represents the cost of the power preference difference of aggregators in each time slot t is proposed as follows. lk \u00bc ck;t ~pk agg t\u00f0 \u00fe \u0002 pk agg

x is the index of the negotiation step; ax is the stepsize and normally it is a constant. the converged shadow price kx\u00fe1 t\u00f0 \u00fe is used as the congestion price. to illustrate the modeling method, we assume 72 house- holds are connected to a power transformer, and the power transformer allocates 200 kw to two ev aggregators. each aggregator (agg 1 and agg 2) has 36 evs, which means a 100% penetration case. the scheduling period considered in the study starts from 16:00 to 06:00 and a 15-minute interval is used (56 time slots are de\ufb01ned). the hourly predicted day- ahead market price is assumed to be known by the aggre- gator. each aggregator uses a linear programming method to generate the aggregated power schedule. for the parameters of the evs used in generating charging schedule, the battery capacity of each ev is set to 24 kwh, the initial state of charge of individual ev is set to 0.2 of the battery capacity, and the maximum charging power is limited to 3.7 kw, which \ufb01ts with the danish case (16 a, 230 v connection). with the values of these parameters, the aggregated power of agg 1 and agg 2 is shown in fig. 5. we note that the aggregated power schedule during time slots 45 to 48, i.e., 02:00 to 03:00, exceeds the allocated capacity of the transformer. therefore, the power schedule at these four time slots needs to be

0.5 and 0.1. a constant stepsize ax = 0.1 is chosen for the lagrangian multiplier update. with the values of the parameters, figs. 6 and 7 show the convergence of the price and the aggregators at time 02:00 to 03:00. as noted in fig. 7, the sum of the power schedule of agg 1 and agg 2 is 200 kw after the iterative infor- mation exchange. the simulation is performed within matlab using cvx, a package for specifying and solving convex programs [47]. 5.2 system balance in this section, the powermatcher development is described, to show the application of the transactive control framework for system balance. powermatcher has been designed as a general-purpose coordination mechanism for balancing demand and supply in large clusters of dis- tributed generation, demand response, and electricity stor- age connected to the distribution grid, and is open-source available. the open-source reference implementation of powermatcher is programmed in java which makes it deployable on a wide variety of processing platforms. the local device control agent software makes use of osgi, which implements an open and modular internet-of-things architecture for java. this makes the powermatcher soft- ware easily deployable and maintainable. powermatcher [43, 48, 49] has been shown to improve the match between consumption and production by: \u0002 adding value to renewable/distributed generation and demand-side \ufb02exi- bility; ` improving the integration of renewable genera- tion; \u00b4 mitigating congestion (i.e. local network overloading) in distribution networks. a comprehensive treatment of this technology can be found in [50]. powermatcher is based on multi-agent systems tech- nology. within a powermatch cluster, the agents are organized into a logic tree. the leaves of this tree are a number of local device agents. the root of the tree is formed by the auctioneer agent, which handles the price forming by searching for the equilibrium price. in order to obtain scalability, concentrator agents can be added to the structure as tree nodes. a local device agent is represen- tative of a der device. for a der unit to be able to participate in a powermatcher cluster, its associated agent must communicate its momentary bid curve or demand function to the auctioneer agent. this function de\ufb01nes the der\u2019s electricity demand d(p) for a given price p. an offer to produce a certain amount of electricity against a certain price is expressed by negative d(p) value. the core func- tionality of the auctioneer and the concentrator is to run the electronic market, allocating the electrical power resource to the local device agents. the electronic market solves this allocation problem by \ufb01nding the general equilibrium price p* such that: x na a\u00bc1 da p\u0005 \u00f0 \u00fe \u00bc 0 \u00f07\u00fe fig. 5 aggregated power schedule of agg 1 and agg 2 fig. 6 convergence of shadow price fig. 7 convergence of power schedule of agg 1 and agg 2 transactive control: a framework for operating power systems\u2026 459 123\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 10\\n\\nwhere na is the number of local device agents; da p \u00f0 \u00fe is the demand function of agent a that states the agent\u2019s demand or supply at a given price p. a number of larger-scale demonstration projects have been conducted successfully with the powermatcher tech- nology, to demonstrate its feasibility and potential. here, we zoom in on one of those, couperus smart grid, alongside the powermatching city project described in section 4. the couperus project demonstrated the ability to perform tasks concurrently for system-wide balancing and local distribution-level congestion management. in this text we focus on the balancing aspect. the couperus smart grid project turned an apartment block, with approx. three hundred apartments and indi- vidual heat pumps for heating, into a virtual power plant using powermatcher technology, performing both imbal- ance reduction and capacity management (peak shaving) in the local lv-to-mv (low voltage to medium voltage) substation. the operational \ufb02exibility can be used to opti- mize the trading position of the energy supplier involved; for example, by reducing the imbalance of a wind farm; i.e. the difference between the day-ahead forecast and the actual production. a more detailed description of the pro- ject\u2019s outcomes can be found in [51], of which we give an overview in this section. each of the apartments in the building is heated by a heat pump with a nominal electrical power of 1 kw. the systems are used for space heating and tap-water heating, and are equipped with a heat-storage tank. the inlet water for all heat pumps comes from a groundwater heat exchanger (aquifer) providing a low inlet temperature, leading to a high energy ef\ufb01ciency of the heating process. the balancing functionality of the vpp is performed by the so-called imbalance agent. in the case of this project, this software agent used the \ufb02exibility of the heat pumps to reduce the imbalance of the wind turbine farm. the real- time imbalance of the wind farm was used as an input for this agent. during this part of the test, 150 heat pumps were connected to the vpp. as each heat pump has a nominal power of 1 kw, and a low duty cycle (i.e. the heat pumps operate with relatively long off times), the power devia- tions requested from the vpp were chosen in the range of \u00b110 kw. from the energy supplier in the project, the imbalance signal of a nearby wind turbine was fed into the system, scaled to this response range. the imbalance signal was the difference between the day-ahead forecasted wind generation and the actual generation. to reduce the wind power imbalance, the imbalance agent bids the imbalance signal into the electronic market. in case of a surplus of wind power, the price on the elec- tronic market to go down, resulting in a number of heat pumps to switch on to consume the surplus. similarly, in case of underproduction, the price will rise and electricity demand from the heat pumps will fall. figure 8 shows the relation between the requested and realized imbalance reduction, as delivered by the vpp over two weeks in the winter. on almost all occasions, the compensation requested can be ful\ufb01lled quantitatively: both signals are highly correlated (correlation equals 0.90) with a slope equal to 1. the response accuracy in the \ufb01g- ure is 94.6%, indicating that the powermatcher performs well coordinating among the heat pumps to compensate the unexpected under- or overproduction of the wind turbine. note that during the winter the heat pumps have the highest running time, providing heat to the apartments, which limits their response. thus, these results can be seen as a worse-case category performance. 6 research challenges compared to conventional power systems operation, one of the important advantages of transactive control is the incorporation of der users\u2019 priorities/ needs/ utilities/ costs into the operation of the power systems. thus the entire system can achieve an optimum balance necessary to meet objectives and constraints. therefore, it is important to investigate the price-response behavior of ders and to design the optimal pricing strategy. next to these two chal- lenges, another issue is how to create and operate a market where ef\ufb01ciency and transparency are guaranteed. on the method front, how to ensure the convergence of the trans- active control application, and increase the speed of the convergences, are also important issues. in addition, the requirements of the ict infrastructure for communication fig. 8 relation between requested and realized imbalance reduction over two winter weeks [51] 460 junjie hu et al. 123\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 11\\n\\namong various stakeholders are another important chal- lenge. last but not least, the standardization of interface of transactive energy is essential for successful implementa- tion. besides these general challenges, speci\ufb01cally, regard- ing application of transactive control in solving network problems, more studies are needed on how to calculate the base line, and how to use the \u2018shadow price\u2019 in practice. 6.1 price-response behavior of ders in a transactive control framework, it is necessary for the der owner to be price sensitive, and able to actively respond to the price informed by the system operator. however, it is a challenge to model the price-response behavior of customers properly. both [52] and [53] describe how, if most of the buildings in a distribution circuit have an energy-management system that turns up the air-conditioning or the heating when electricity prices drop below a threshold, then the distribution circuit, and indeed the entire grid, can be destabilized, due to the ampli\ufb01ed spikes. to understand the price-response behav- ior of customers, methods including a conditional logit model [54] and a parametric stochastic process [55] are presented in the literature. nevertheless, it is noted in [54, 55], the extent to which a properly designed price signal could assist in maintaining that grid reliability will remain open until the der owner\u2019s price responsiveness is tested empirically through experiments. 6.2 pricing strategy design and convergence issue as discussed in [52], a simple price strategy may destabilize the power system operation. in contrast to conventional power system operation, in the near future, more distributed energy resources integrated into operation requires additional research on the convergence of dynamic pricing. in real-time operation, new market mechanisms are needed to create effective interactions that are closely linked to the distribution control systems and ders, to ensure the security and ef\ufb01ciency of the system, as well as the optimality of the der operation. regarding the con- vergence of the iterative-based method under the circum- stance of transactive control, [29] and [38] discuss that, in general, the convergence can be obtained by following certain stepsize rules. in addition, as described in [38], the algorithms \ufb01nd near-optimal schedules, even when advanced metering infrastructures (ami) messages (up- dated prices and residential load) are lost, which can hap- pen in the presence of malfunctions, or noise in the communication network. however, much research is nee- ded to increase the convergence speed, since high iteration numbers are seen in many studies, and these imply more time is needed for convergence. 6.3 market place design to ensure enough competition and fairness in the capacity market, one prerequisite is the number of market participants; e.g., fos in section 5.1. if there are few fos in the distribution area, and issue such as market power will become a major challenge from the market perspec- tive. thus how to de\ufb01ne the market rules that can create enough competition and fairness will be a big challenge in transactive control application. it is worth mentioning that the application of transactive control does not call for a central market. a centralized marketplace can potentially bring too many participants, considering ders\u2019 direct participation, into one platform, which brings challenges both for market design and for operation. the creation of distributed marketplaces may be a reasonable approach to involve more ders into the current operation. the distributed marketplaces could possibly following the existing geographical distribution areas. 6.4 requirements for ict infrastructure in addition to conventional stakeholders, the new stakeholders in smart grid will probably include aggrega- tors and prosumers. thus communication will be an important issue, since a large population of stakeholders needs to be connected. for example, in the case presented in section 5.1, fos need to communicate well with evs, in order to make an optimal charging schedule, and this information includes driving pattern, state of charge, and some other preferences of ev owners. the time-constraint is not an essential issue in the scheduling problem, although fos need real-time information exchange to ensure the schedule is properly executed. for the interac- tion between fos and the distribution grid capacity market operator, real-time communication is a challenge, but a reasonable time range can be established, as well as trying to limit the market iteration with certain rules. this kind of setup will require an advanced ict infrastructure that is becoming affordable. furthermore, as discussed in [45], an ict delay during market-clearing can introduce an instability issue into the power system. it is noted in the paper that there is a counterintuitive relationship between the market-clearing time and the price-signal delay: when the market-clearing time is relatively long, delaying the price signal can improve the market\u2019s stability, while reducing the com- munication delay can destabilize the market. this coun- terintuitive effect shows that the full impact of information technology on power markets can be signi\ufb01cant and dif\ufb01- cult to anticipate. therefore, as markets are incorporated into transactive control applications, careful attention transactive control: a framework for operating power systems\u2026 461 123\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 12\\n\\nshould be paid to the effects of information technology on the market\u2019s dynamic behavior. 6.5 standardization of interface of transactive energy the envisioned standardized interfaces include two aspects: \u0002 an interface for all the actors participating in the transactive energy market, which will de\ufb01ne the bid forms; e.g., according to the market structure, market operating mechanism; ` an interface with ders; i.e., the informa- tion sent by the market operator should be understood by the ders, and thus the ders can respond to the signal. to build a standardized platform that accelerates the devel- opment of transactive energy, several initiatives have been seen in the \ufb01eld, including: usef (universal smart energy framework [56]); openadr (open automated demand response) alliance [57]; and ef-pi (energy flexibility platform and interface) white paper [58]. 6.6 baseline issue the baseline is normally de\ufb01ned as an estimate of the electricity that would have been consumed by a customer in the absence of a demand-response event [59, 60]. for example, in the \ufb01rst case study, the transactive control method enables the demand response. the aggregator that optimally generates the energy schedule is an operation in the absence of a demand-response event. thus, the opti- mized energy schedule of the aggregators will be used as a baseline in the transactive control method, to prevent grid constraint violation. however, aggregators may not make the energy schedule optimal. instead, they can procure the electricity based on the customer\u2019s power usage pattern. under this circumstance, the customer\u2019s normal daily pro\ufb01les will be used as a baseline. nevertheless, more research is needed to characterize the baseline, since it will be very important in the settlement stage. 7 conclusions in summary, from a demand response-enabling approach to a power system operational principle, the transactive control framework has shown its distinctive capability to incorporate der users\u2019 priorities, needs, or costs that accommodate the high penetration of distributed energy resources smoothly into future power systems. the implementation methods of transactive control include a one-time information exchange-based approach, and an iterative information exchange-based method. these two methods have been used widely in the literature and demonstration projects. note that, for a hierarchical transactive control system, it is possible to combine both implementation methods, such as using the one-time information method on lower levels, and having an itera- tive information exchange method in the upper levels. finally, there is also a need for policymakers to better understand the relationship between pricing schemes and control systems, as it relates to distributed energy resources to ensure proper market structures and rules, to maintain a highly reliable and clean energy system. the current development trend is to integrate all the energy networks together, to hedge against the intermit- tency brought about by the increasing penetration of renewable energy. the ultimate goal of this development would be a so-called \u2018\u2018energy internet\u2019\u2019, where energy can be polled and sent from anyone, anywhere, at any time. the operation of such a system would involve more par- ticipants from different energy networks than the ones seen today. the incentives for participation would be from some designed market mechanisms and eventually, the system operation would be based on handling various energy offers and requests from all the participants. in the opera- tion, all the participants, including the grid operators, will come with their own objectives, as well as constraints, for participation. the problem will become highly complex, including concerns from both economic and technical aspects. such situations may be suitable for the application of transactive control principles. acknowledgement the authors thank pamela macdougall

koen kok1,2, yusheng xue3, henrik w. bindner1 abstract the increasing number of distributed energy resources connected to power systems raises operational challenges for the network operator, such as introducing grid congestion and voltage deviations in the distribution network level, as well as increasing balancing needs at the whole system level. control and coordination of a large number of distributed energy assets requires innovative approaches. transactive control has received much atten- tion due to its decentralized decision-making and trans- parent characteristics. this paper introduces the concept and main features of transactive control, followed by a literature review and demonstration projects that apply to transactive control. cases are then presented to illustrate the transactive control framework. at the end, discussions and research directions are presented, for applying trans- active control to operating power systems, characterized by a high penetration of distributed energy resources. keywords distributed energy resources, distribution system operation, smart grids, transactive control 1 introduction an important means used by the power industry to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and fossil-fuel dependency is the introduction of renewable energy generation such as wind and solar [1\u20133]. as part of this transition to sustainability, the majority of new generation units are being connected to distribution grids [4, 5]. in addition, new loads are being introduced, such as electric vehicles and heat pumps. although these new loads lead to higher overall energy ef\ufb01ciency, their introduction leads to higher electricity use and thus, to higher power loading of the power grid. these new energy resources bring challenges to power system operation, including a decline in reserve power from tradi- tional sources [6], and grid congestion [7]. in this paper, electric vehicles, heat pumpsetc.\ufb02exible loads, storages, and distributed generation, including renewable generation units such as wind turbine and photovoltaic generation, are gen- erally referred to distributed energy resources (der). in order to cope with the challenges described above, der needs to be become actively involved in grid coordination and operation tasks; and the demand response scheme of the der needs to be introduced to make available additional operational \ufb02exibility [8]. the problems encountered in the power systems have received much attention, and various efforts have been made to address the problems. these range from

individual component operation [9] to radical rethinking of system operations [10\u201313]. in [11\u201313], the need for coordination between transmission system operator (tso) and distribution sys- tem operator (dso) operation are discussed. traditionally, the system is kept secure by centralized control actions. for example, the transmission system operator centrally con- trols few big power plants through a supervisory control and data acquisition system. the distribution system operator centrally manages the status of key devices, such as breakers, reference setting points of on/off load tap changers, capacity banks, etc. however, it is impossible to control a large number of distributed energy resources today [8], as the grid control systems are centralized by design, and do not yet actively integrate distributed energy resources into the operation on a meaningful scale. the current development of smart grid technologies allows ders to adjust their operation through on-site local monitoring and computing, and receive remote-control signals from a market or grid operator using information communication technology (ict). it is likely that the electrical power system will evolve into a hybrid system in the next 20 years, with a set of primary generation, storage, and transmission systems coordinated through the market, and a set of distributed resources managed on a decen- tralized basis, using a mechanism that can leverage the capabilities of der systems [8]. the control and coordi- nation of a large number of distributed energy resources requires innovative distributed approaches. transactive control is such an approach. transactive control is a form of market-based control that has been adopted by several projects and initiatives [14, 15]. the intent of transactive control is to reach equilibriums by standardizing a scalable, distributed mechanism via exchanging information about generation, consumption, constraints, and responsive assets over dynamic, real-time forecasting periods, using economic incentive signaling [16], and thus solving complex power system problems. in another words, the operation is based on the management of interactions instead of actions. this paper reviews the recent development in transac- tive control application, and illustrates that as a framework which can be applied generally to the operation of power systems characterized by a high penetration of distributed energy resources. by reviewing the existing demonstration projects and literature, and presenting illustrative case studies, the paper classi\ufb01es the implementing methods of transactive control by way of information exchange between the involved actors and the operational purpose. furthermore, the research challenges faced by the appli- cation of transactive control in future power systems are discussed. the remainder of the paper is organized as follows: concepts and main methods of transactive control are introduced in section 2. section 3 reviews the literature that applies to the transactive control framework to manage distributed energy resources. in section 4, demonstration projects are described. section 5 presents two case studies using the transactive control framework. research chal- lenges are discussed in section 6. finally, a discussion and conclusion are given in section 7. 2 transactive control in smart grids 2.1 basic concept a transaction is an exchange of goods, services and/or funds through negotiation. accordingly, transactive control is a framework that enables actors to interact with each other through an economic signal, in order to optimize the allocation of resources. in [14], transactive control is de\ufb01ned as an implementation of transactive energy. transactive energy is \u2018\u2018a set of economic and control mechanisms that allows the dynamic balance of supply and demand across the entire electrical infrastructure using value as a key operational parameter\u2019\u2019 [14]. in a transactive energy-management system, mid- to small-sized electric- ity-consuming or producing devices automatically negoti- ate their actions with each other, with devices in the physical network, and with dispatch systems of energy suppliers through ef\ufb01cient and scalable electronic mar- ket algorithms [17]. in fact, transactive control is already in use in some wholesale energy markets in the world, for instance the nord pool spot market [18]. the trading and clearing mechanism used in the market is a typical form of trans- active control. however, the application of transactive control is still largely missing in distribution system operation and at the retail market level. in the transactive control framework, the utility function applied in microeconomics is used, and describes the degree of well-being the product provides for consumers. it thus de\ufb01nes the different responses of different devices to various prices [19]. as a framework, its application in power systems can be classi\ufb01ed into the following aspects, which will be discussed further in sections 3 and 4. 1) frequency regulation via tertiary control [20]. 2) frequency control in power systems via secondary control [19]. 3) congestion and voltage management in distribution network [7, 21\u201323]. 4) manage the energy distribution inside an operation of balance responsible parties (or aggregators) [24, 25]. 452 junjie hu et al. 123\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 3\\n\\n5) distribution system operation in term of in\ufb02uencing the behaviors of the decision-makers connected on the network [26]. 6) new electricity spot market mechanism that facilitates the participation of \ufb02exible demand [27, 28]. 7) residential optimal energy management considering network operational constraints of utility [29\u201331]. 2.2 time scale in transactive control, one of the main ideas is to inte- grate retail and wholesale markets, and other markets, into a single platform, by utilizing forward and spot transac- tions, thereby guiding investment and operating decisions [32]. forward transaction is used to coordinate investment decisions and manage risks. spot transaction is used to coordinate operating decisions and mitigate risk. the time scale of these two type transactions is shown in fig. 1. forward transactions are not new compared to the current market mechanism. however, the spot could be real time, or close to real time, e.g., 5 minutes. in the demonstration projects described in section 4, a 5-minute market is widely used. 2.3 implementing methods in general, two types of implementing methods are widely used in the literature, and in the demonstration projects that will be introduced in sections 3 and 4. the implementing method is de\ufb01ned as a way to \ufb01nd the equilibrium among the actors, and thus complete the transactions. these two kinds of approaches include: 1) a one-time information exchange-based method, such as the merit-order-based market-clearing mechanism. 2) an iterative information exchange-based method that, mathematically, is normally explained by dual decom- position computing algorithms. in the demonstration projects, the one-time information exchange-based method is widely applied. each participator generates a bid (a quantity and a price) for every bid period (e.g., 5 minutes), and communicates with the aggregating entity. figure 2 shows an example of the method to solve a grid congestion problem. three steps are included in the transactive control. firstly, each device (or device agent) bids their available \ufb02exibility to the aggre- gating entity (system operator in this case). then, the system operator aggregates the bids and performs a price- discovery mechanism; i.e., a merit-order-based market- clearing mechanism to \ufb01nd the clearing price. the cleared price is used to control the devices. we note that merit- order-based market-clearing mechanism is widely used to \ufb01nd the price, and to realize the transactions in the demonstration projects. besides the one-time information exchange, an iterative information exchange-based method is also widely pro- posed that normally exploits the algorithms of dual decomposition [34, 35]. note that in transactive control framework, the dual variables are normally interpreted as prices that re\ufb02ect the equilibriums, while in many studies they only serve as the coordinating signals [34, 35]. fig- ure 3 illustrates the scheme of the method. examples are given in the \ufb01gure where the interaction between system operator/aggregators and aggregators/der units are pre- sented. note that the upper-level entity sends the price to the lower-level entity; in correspondence, the lower level responds with its power schedules. after certain iterations, an agreement is reached between the upper-level entity and the lower-level entity. in our view, the upper-level entity decides when to stop based on its operational purpose. note that the key difference between these two approaches is the information exchange timing. the one- time information exchange-based method is less complex, leading to lower communication requirements and higher scalability. the iterative information exchange-based method can present actors more opportunity to exchange their operational conditions and willingness, but may need more time to reach equilibriums. in practical applications, the iterative information exchange-based method is expected to be useful in the scheduling phase, while the one-time information exchange-based method is more suitable of the real-time control phase. 3 literature review regarding application of transactive control in smart grids this section overviews the studies that apply the trans- active control framework for managing distributed energy resources with different purposes in smart grids. in [7], the transactive control method is applied to solve

charging schedule of all the fos may bring operational challenges to the dso, and thus it needs to be modi\ufb01ed. then, a \ufb02exibility cost function of fo is formulated that re\ufb02ects the charging power deviation from the scheduled charging power in the form of a quadratic function. the overall objective is to minimize the \ufb02exi- bility cost function of ev fos with respect to the grid capacity constraints. the minimization is formulated as a lagrange problem, and solved iteratively using a decom- position algorithm. the lagrange multipliers are inter- preted as congestion price that coordinates the ev fo\u2019s charging pro\ufb01les. furthermore, the study is extended in [21] to solve the voltage-band violations by introducing congestion prices at the buses level. in [22], ipakchi pointed out that a higher penetration of distributed energy resources will require greater attention to distribution congestion issues, and a need for improved distribution-automation and distribution-management capabilities. a transactive control approach is proposed to solve these problems. in the example described in the paper, a plug-in electric vehicle requests 7.8 kwh of charging energy over the next two hours. this request can be presented as a demand transaction and sent to a demand-side management application operated by the utility. knowing the transaction delivery point to which the car charger is connected, this application will check the available capacity of the low-voltage distribution transformer and feeders. then it determines whether the additional load will impact the circuit reliability and cause any adverse phase imbalances. the demand-side man- agement system will then schedule the charging for the requested time period. at the same time, the management system may receive many more charging requests that have to be checked and coordinated with wholesale scheduling at the substation supplying the feeders, to ensure adequate supply. each of these actions could be modeled as a transaction among the consumers, the util- ity, and suppliers. besides the application of congestion and voltage management [7, 21, 22] in the distribution system, a con- ceptual framework of using transactive control is proposed in [26] that aims to optimally coordinate the operation of self-interested individual decision-makers that emerge in the distribution system. the optimal operation of the grid is described according to a set of prede\ufb01ned technical and economic targets, and can be achieved by in\ufb02uencing the behaviors of the decision-makers with appropriate market signals. in the study, the authors argue that complex system theory can be used to support the framework. in addition, a price-response device control

the study to test the transac- tive control strategy. reference [36] formulated a class of \ufb01nite horizon dynamic game (or a transactive control system) to opti- mally control the charging pro\ufb01le of a large number of electric vehicles. within the game, the control objective is to minimize electricity-generation costs by establishing an ev charging schedule that \ufb01lls the overnight demand val- ley. moreover, the paper established a suf\ufb01cient condition under which the system converges to the unique nash equilibrium. in order to implement the transactive control system, an iterative algorithm for computing the unique nash equilibrium is proposed, which includes four steps: step 1: the utility broadcasts the forecast of base demand to all the evs. step 2: each of the evs proposes an optimal charging strategy that minimizes its charging cost, with respect to a common aggregated ev demand broadcasted by the utility. step 3: the utility collects all the optimal charging strategies proposed by the individual evs, and updates the aggregated ev demand to all evs. step 4: repeat step 2 and step 3 until the optimal strategies proposed by all evs no longer change. a similar study performed in [37] proved that a trans- active control-based algorithm converges to optimal charging pro\ufb01les, irrespective of the speci\ufb01cations of evs, even with asynchronous computation. besides, the authors also extended the algorithm to track a given load pro\ufb01le and to real-time implementation. furthermore, in [38], the study deals with more loads in a multiple residence setup. the study \ufb01nds the social-welfare maximization for energy scheduling, between a utility company and residential energy-users. the problem is solved by a distributed sub- gradient method that can be supported by an advanced metering infrastructure (a two-way communication network). in addition to optimally managing the residential energy of a utility [36\u201338], the study in [29] suggested a two-stage residential energy-management method that considered network operational constraints. in the \ufb01rst stage, a day- ahead pricing scheme and residential appliance scheduling are determined through the interaction of the utility com- pany and residential customers. in the second stage, prices are updated based on the actual residential loads that draw lessons from the locational marginal price (lmp) used in the transmission system. in addition, in [30, 31], transac- tive control is used to coordinate the thermostatic loads with the purpose of realizing ef\ufb01cient energy allocation, subject to peak energy constraint (feeder capacity con- straints described in the study). in [24], a scalable three-step approach for demand-side management of evs is presented. the three steps consist of aggregation, optimization, and control. in the aggregation step, individual ev charging constraints are aggregated upwards. in the optimization step, the aggregated con- straints are used for the scalable computation of a collec- tive charging plan, which minimizes costs for the electricity supply. in the real-time control step, the objec- tive to divide the optimal power generated in step 2 between the individual evs, is determined by a market- based priority scheme. the work is further developed in [25], where an event-driven dual coordination mechanism is presented at the real-time control level. the simulation result indicated that the number of messages exchanged with the evs was signi\ufb01cantly reduced, by at least 64%. in [23], the transactive control framework is proposed to manage the charging of electric vehicles, and incorporates a distribution transformer and voltage constraints. a hier- archical multi-agent structure was used in the study, con- sisting of an auctioneer agent, substation agent, and ev device agent. the substation agent summed up the bid functions of all the underlying devices in a low-voltage network, and in turn sent the bid function to a unique auctioneer agent who de\ufb01ned the equilibrium price. in addition, the substation agent also ensured that the grid constraints were not violated, given the possible equilib- rium price. in [19], the auction-based transactive control is applied to control the cluster of loads with the purpose of providing spinning reserves. firstly, each device de\ufb01nes a utility function for the utilization of the power \ufb02exibility; e.g., the corner price model developed in [24] is applied to calculate the bid function of an ev. then, in real-time operation, all the device agents send their bids to a concentrator agent or \ufb02eet operator agent. the concentrator agent sums up the bid functions of their zone, and then sends the aggregated bid function to a unique auctioneer agent. finally, the auctioneer agent will de\ufb01ne the equilibrium price as the intersection of the aggregate bid functions and the supply bid function. after the equilibrium price is de\ufb01ned, it is sent back to all of the devices agents, and the corre- sponding power of the device agents will be determined. the market-clearing takes place every 15 minutes, or can be made event-driven. furthermore, the transactive control method is extended to cooperate in frequency reserve markets. in [20], a hierarchical transactive control architecture combines market transactions at the tertiary level with inter-area and unit-level control at the primary and sec- ondary level. the purpose of the hierarchical transactive control is to ensure frequency regulating, using optimal allocation of resources in the presence of uncertainties in renewables and load. models and controllers developed at the tertiary level follow the standard market-clearing pro- cedure that aims at social-welfare maximization. the transactive control: a framework for operating power systems\u2026 455 123\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 6\\n\\nproblem is solved iteratively, and the global asymptotic stability of the overall system is established. in [27, 28], a novel day-ahead pool market mechanism is proposed, to facilitate the participation of \ufb02exible demand in the electricity market. in the study, the market-clearing optimization problem is, \ufb01rstly, converted from a social- welfare maximization problem to an equivalent generation cost-minimization problem, and then solved indirectly by its lagrangian dual problem. the mathematical decompo- sition scheme is interpreted as a two-level iterative market- clearing mechanism, with the elements of lambda repre- senting the 24-hour electricity price. the proposed market mechanism is demonstrated with electric vehicles and heat- pump systems. in summary, a key operational parameter used in trans- active control is value (i.e., cost/utility functions in [7, 19, 21\u201325, 36, 37]). thereafter the equilibrium price can be discovered and the transaction can be executed. it is seen that iterative information exchange is required to reach equilibriums between the \ufb02eet operator and electric vehicles in [7, 21, 36, 37], while only one-time information exchange is required in [19, 21\u201325] to reach the equilibrium. the aforementioned studies are summarized in table 1. 4 demonstration projects in us and europe in this section, four demonstration projects are brie\ufb02y introduced: the grisewise olympic peninsula project, the paci\ufb01c northwest demonstration project, and the grid- smart demonstration project from the usa; and the powermatching city project from europe. the summary of demonstration project using transactive control framework is shown in table 2. gridwise olympic peninsula project [39]: the project adopted transactive control to coordinate the power use of residential electric water heaters and thermostats, commercial building-space conditioning, municipal water pump loads, and several distributed generators, with the purpose of reducing stress on local distribution networks. the \ufb01eld demonstration took place in washington and oregon, and was paid for by the u.s. department of energy and several northwest utilities. real-time price at 5-minute intervals was found to be an effective control signal for managing distribution congestion. peak loads were effectively reduced on the experimental feeder. the paci\ufb01c northwest demonstration project [40]: the project expanded upon the experience of the previously described gridwise olympic peninsula project. this pro- ject provided two-way communication between distributed generation, storage, and demand assets, and the existing gird infrastructure. the purpose was to use and test the tranactive control signal. the signals communicated the cost of delivering energy to a speci\ufb01c location. using automated controller, the devices such as water heaters, electric furnaces etc. could make their own decision when to use electricity. gridsmart demonstration project [41]: the project aimed to design, build, and operate a transactive control system, to engage residential consumers and their end-use resources, to address the local-scale grid congestion. the method has the advantage of providing greater ef\ufb01ciency under normal operating conditions, and greater \ufb02exibility to react under situations of system stress. three main aspects were studied: the impact on system operations, and on households, and observations about the sensitivity of load to price changes. powermatching city [42]: powermatching city is a living lab environment based on state-of-the-art off-the- shelf consumer products that have been altered to provide \ufb02exibility, and allow coordination with the smart grid [43]. the technology used in the project is powermatcher [44]; a \u2018demand response\u2019 technology that balances all smart devices, from low voltage to high voltage, in a virtual table 1 summary of references using transactive control framework

\ufb01rst phase of the demonstration, pow- ermatching city consisted of 22 common dutch house- holds, located near the city of groningen, in the netherlands. later, this number was scaled up further. the houses were \ufb01tted with either a domestic combined heat and power unit (micro-chp) or a heat pump with a gas- \ufb01red heater [45]. some households also contained intelli- gent white-good appliances, and electric vehicles were integrated as well. outside the district, a 2.5 mw wind turbine was available. the output power of the wind tur- bine could be scaled down digitally to match the con- sumption of the households. all devices were interfaced with powermatcher software, to operate powermatching city as a virtual power plant (vpp). it was concluded that the vpp successfully followed its optimized energy pro\ufb01le, and provided the required regulatory power at the same time [46]. 5 case studies as the market adoption of der reaches regional scale it will create signi\ufb01cant issues in the management of the distribution system related to existing planning and control. this is likely to lead to problems for power quality and reliability, since integrating distributed resources into wholesale markets, without aligning distribution control schemes, may create unacceptable consequences. further- more, as discussed in [10], as distributed energy resources increase, the need to balance these resources across the distribution system will likely give rise to the development of a distribution system control tier, to complement the bulk power system control tier. thus,inthisstudy,wepresenttworelevantcasestudiesthat apply transactive control framework at the distribution system level. the \ufb01rst case gives a brief overview of the developed work [7], where distribution congestions are solved by a transactive control framework. in the second case, a transac- tive control is applied to manage the distribution system bal- ance dynamically between supply and demand. to apply the transactive control in both case studies, a software agent (either an aggregator in section 5.1 or a local device agent in section 5.2) will be present to rep- resent the der\u2019s operational \ufb02exibility. the agent will form a cost function (section 5.1) or a walrasian demand function (section 5.2) to characterize the \ufb02exibility. these functions are bid into a virtual market where the equilib- rium will be found among the agents. the conditions of the equilibrium\u2019s existence depend on the convexity of the cost functions or the monotonicity of the demand functions. more assumptions and conditions of applying transactive control method are presented in section 6. 5.1 distribution grid congestion management considering electric vehicle integration in this case, we use electric vehicles as an example to be integrated in the distribution system. figure 4 shows that the system consists of three actors: distribution system operator, aggregators, and electric vehicle owners located in a low-voltage network. in this system, we assume aggregator manage the charging schedule of electric vehicles centrally, with the purpose of procuring the electricity from a spot market in a low-price period, and fulling the energy requirements of ev charging. however, if all the evs are charged in the low-price period, the aggregated power may introduce a congestion problem into the distribution network. thus, transactive control will be used between the dso and the aggregator to coordinate the power schedules. in [7] and [21], a \ufb02exibility cost function that represents the cost of the power preference difference of aggregators in each time slot t is proposed as follows. lk \u00bc ck;t ~pk agg t\u00f0 \u00fe \u0002 pk agg

modeling method, we assume 72 house- holds are connected to a power transformer, and the power transformer allocates 200 kw to two ev aggregators. each aggregator (agg 1 and agg 2) has 36 evs, which means a 100% penetration case. the scheduling period considered in the study starts from 16:00 to 06:00 and a 15-minute interval is used (56 time slots are de\ufb01ned). the hourly predicted day- ahead market price is assumed to be known by the aggre- gator. each aggregator uses a linear programming method to generate the aggregated power schedule. for the parameters of the evs used in generating charging schedule, the battery capacity of each ev is set to 24 kwh, the initial state of charge of individual ev is set to 0.2 of the battery capacity, and the maximum charging power is limited to 3.7 kw, which \ufb01ts with the danish case (16 a, 230 v connection). with the values of these parameters, the aggregated power of agg 1 and agg 2 is shown in fig. 5. we note that the aggregated power schedule during time slots 45 to 48, i.e., 02:00 to 03:00, exceeds the allocated capacity of the transformer. therefore, the power schedule at these four time slots needs to be

02:00 to 03:00. as noted in fig. 7, the sum of the power schedule of agg 1 and agg 2 is 200 kw after the iterative infor- mation exchange. the simulation is performed within matlab using cvx, a package for specifying and solving convex programs [47]. 5.2 system balance in this section, the powermatcher development is described, to show the application of the transactive control framework for system balance. powermatcher has been designed as a general-purpose coordination mechanism for balancing demand and supply in large clusters of dis- tributed generation, demand response, and electricity stor- age connected to the distribution grid, and is open-source available. the open-source reference implementation of powermatcher is programmed in java which makes it deployable on a wide variety of processing platforms. the local device control agent software makes use of osgi, which implements an open and modular internet-of-things architecture for java. this makes the powermatcher soft- ware easily deployable and maintainable. powermatcher [43, 48, 49] has been shown to improve the match between consumption and production by: \u0002 adding value to renewable/distributed generation and demand-side \ufb02exi- bility; ` improving the integration of renewable genera- tion; \u00b4 mitigating congestion (i.e. local network overloading) in distribution networks. a comprehensive treatment of this technology can be found in [50]. powermatcher is based on multi-agent systems tech- nology. within a powermatch cluster, the agents are organized into a logic tree. the leaves of this tree are a number of local device agents. the root of the tree is formed by the auctioneer agent, which handles the price forming by searching for the equilibrium price. in order to obtain scalability, concentrator agents can be added to the structure as tree nodes. a local device agent is represen- tative of a der device. for a der unit to be able to participate in a powermatcher cluster, its associated agent must communicate its momentary bid curve or demand function to the auctioneer agent. this function de\ufb01nes the der\u2019s electricity demand d(p) for a given price p. an offer to produce a certain amount of electricity against a certain price is expressed by negative d(p) value. the core func- tionality of the auctioneer and the concentrator is to run the electronic market, allocating the electrical power resource to the local device agents. the electronic market solves this allocation problem by \ufb01nding the general equilibrium price p* such that: x na a\u00bc1 da p\u0005 \u00f0 \u00fe \u00bc 0 \u00f07\u00fe fig. 5 aggregated power schedule of agg 1 and agg 2 fig. 6 convergence of shadow price fig. 7 convergence of power schedule of agg 1 and agg 2 transactive control: a framework for operating power systems\u2026 459 123\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 10\\n\\nwhere na is the number of local device agents; da p \u00f0 \u00fe is the demand function of agent a that states the agent\u2019s demand or supply at a given price p. a number of larger-scale demonstration projects have been conducted successfully with the powermatcher tech- nology, to demonstrate its feasibility and potential. here, we zoom in on one of those, couperus smart grid, alongside the powermatching city project described in section 4. the couperus project demonstrated the ability to perform tasks concurrently for system-wide balancing and local distribution-level congestion management. in this text we focus on the balancing aspect. the couperus smart grid project turned an apartment block, with approx. three hundred apartments and indi- vidual heat pumps for heating, into a virtual power plant using powermatcher technology, performing both imbal- ance reduction and capacity management (peak shaving) in the local lv-to-mv (low voltage to medium voltage) substation. the operational \ufb02exibility can be used to opti- mize the trading position of the energy supplier involved; for example, by reducing the imbalance of a wind farm; i.e. the difference between the day-ahead forecast and the actual production. a more detailed description of the pro- ject\u2019s outcomes can be found in [51], of which we give an overview in this section. each of the apartments in the building is heated by a heat pump with a nominal electrical power of 1 kw. the systems are used for space heating and tap-water heating, and are equipped with a heat-storage tank. the inlet water for all heat pumps comes from a groundwater heat exchanger (aquifer) providing a low inlet temperature, leading to a high energy ef\ufb01ciency of the heating process. the balancing functionality of the vpp is performed by the so-called imbalance agent. in the case of this project, this software agent used the \ufb02exibility of the heat pumps to reduce the imbalance of the wind turbine farm. the real- time imbalance of the wind farm was used as an input for this agent. during this part of the test, 150 heat pumps were connected to the vpp. as each heat pump has a nominal power of 1 kw, and a low duty cycle (i.e. the heat pumps operate with relatively long off times), the power devia- tions requested from the vpp were chosen in the range of \u00b110 kw. from the energy supplier in the project, the imbalance signal of a nearby wind turbine was fed into the system, scaled to this response range. the imbalance signal was the difference between the day-ahead forecasted wind generation and the actual generation. to reduce the wind power imbalance, the imbalance agent bids the imbalance signal into the electronic market. in case of a surplus of wind power, the price on the elec- tronic market to go down, resulting in a number of heat pumps to switch on to consume the surplus. similarly, in case of underproduction, the price will rise and electricity demand from the heat pumps will fall. figure 8 shows the relation between the requested and realized imbalance reduction, as delivered by the vpp over two weeks in the winter. on almost all occasions, the compensation requested can be ful\ufb01lled quantitatively: both signals are highly correlated (correlation equals 0.90) with a slope equal to 1. the response accuracy in the \ufb01g- ure is 94.6%, indicating that the powermatcher performs well coordinating among the heat pumps to compensate the unexpected under- or overproduction of the wind turbine. note that during the winter the heat pumps have the highest running time, providing heat to the apartments, which limits their response. thus, these results can be seen as a worse-case category performance. 6 research challenges compared to conventional power systems operation, one of the important advantages of transactive control is the incorporation of der users\u2019 priorities/ needs/ utilities/ costs into the operation of the power systems. thus the entire system can achieve an optimum balance necessary to meet objectives and constraints. therefore, it is important to investigate the price-response behavior of ders and to design the optimal pricing strategy. next to these two chal- lenges, another issue is how to create and operate a market where ef\ufb01ciency and transparency are guaranteed. on the method front, how to ensure the convergence of the trans- active control application, and increase the speed of the convergences, are also important issues. in addition, the requirements of the ict infrastructure for communication fig. 8 relation between requested and realized imbalance reduction over two winter weeks [51] 460 junjie hu et al. 123\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 11\\n\\namong various stakeholders are another important chal- lenge. last but not least, the standardization of interface of transactive energy is essential for successful implementa- tion. besides these general challenges, speci\ufb01cally, regard- ing application of transactive control in solving network problems, more studies are needed on how to calculate the base line, and how to use the \u2018shadow price\u2019 in practice. 6.1 price-response behavior of ders in a transactive control framework, it is necessary for the der owner to be price sensitive, and able to actively respond to the price informed by the system operator. however, it is a challenge to model the price-response behavior of customers properly. both [52] and [53] describe how, if most of the buildings in a distribution circuit have an energy-management system that turns up the air-conditioning or the heating when electricity prices drop below a threshold, then the distribution circuit, and indeed the entire grid, can be destabilized, due to the ampli\ufb01ed spikes. to understand the price-response behav- ior of customers, methods including a conditional logit model [54] and a parametric stochastic process [55] are presented in the literature. nevertheless, it is noted in [54, 55], the extent to which a properly designed price signal could assist in maintaining that grid reliability will remain open until the der owner\u2019s price responsiveness is tested empirically through experiments. 6.2 pricing strategy design and convergence issue as discussed in [52], a simple price strategy may destabilize the power system operation. in contrast to conventional power system operation, in the near future, more distributed energy resources integrated into operation requires additional research on the convergence of dynamic pricing. in real-time operation, new market mechanisms are needed to create effective interactions that are closely linked to the distribution control systems and ders, to ensure the security and ef\ufb01ciency of the system, as well as the optimality of the der operation. regarding the con- vergence of the iterative-based method under the circum- stance of transactive control, [29] and [38] discuss that, in general, the convergence can be obtained by following certain stepsize rules. in addition, as described in [38], the algorithms \ufb01nd near-optimal schedules, even when advanced metering infrastructures (ami) messages (up- dated prices and residential load) are lost, which can hap- pen in the presence of malfunctions, or noise in the communication network. however, much research is nee- ded to increase the convergence speed, since high iteration numbers are seen in many studies, and these imply more time is needed for convergence. 6.3 market place design to ensure enough competition and fairness in the capacity market, one prerequisite is the number of market participants; e.g., fos in section 5.1. if there are few fos in the distribution area, and issue such as market power will become a major challenge from the market perspec- tive. thus how to de\ufb01ne the market rules that can create enough competition and fairness will be a big challenge in transactive control application. it is worth mentioning that the application of transactive control does not call for a central market. a centralized marketplace can potentially bring too many participants, considering ders\u2019 direct participation, into one platform, which brings challenges both for market design and for operation. the creation of distributed marketplaces may be a reasonable approach to involve more ders into the current operation. the distributed marketplaces could possibly following the existing geographical distribution areas. 6.4 requirements for ict infrastructure in addition to conventional stakeholders, the new stakeholders in smart grid will probably include aggrega- tors and prosumers. thus communication will be an important issue, since a large population of stakeholders needs to be connected. for example, in the case presented in section 5.1, fos need to communicate well with evs, in order to make an optimal charging schedule, and this information includes driving pattern, state of charge, and some other preferences of ev owners. the time-constraint is not an essential issue in the scheduling problem, although fos need real-time information exchange to ensure the schedule is properly executed. for the interac- tion between fos and the distribution grid capacity market operator, real-time communication is a challenge, but a reasonable time range can be established, as well as trying to limit the market iteration with certain rules. this kind of setup will require an advanced ict infrastructure that is becoming affordable. furthermore, as discussed in [45], an ict delay during market-clearing can introduce an instability issue into the power system. it is noted in the paper that there is a counterintuitive relationship between the market-clearing time and the price-signal delay: when the market-clearing time is relatively long, delaying the price signal can improve the market\u2019s stability, while reducing the com- munication delay can destabilize the market. this coun- terintuitive effect shows that the full impact of information technology on power markets can be signi\ufb01cant and dif\ufb01- cult to anticipate. therefore, as markets are incorporated into transactive control applications, careful attention transactive control: a framework for operating power systems\u2026 461 123\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 12\\n\\nshould be paid to the effects of information technology on the market\u2019s dynamic behavior. 6.5 standardization of interface of transactive energy the envisioned standardized interfaces include two aspects: \u0002 an interface for all the actors participating in the transactive energy market, which will de\ufb01ne the bid forms; e.g., according to the market structure, market operating mechanism; ` an interface with ders; i.e., the informa- tion sent by the market operator should be understood by the ders, and thus the ders can respond to the signal. to build a standardized platform that accelerates the devel- opment of transactive energy, several initiatives have been seen in the \ufb01eld, including: usef (universal smart energy framework [56]); openadr (open automated demand response) alliance [57]; and ef-pi (energy flexibility platform and interface) white paper [58]. 6.6 baseline issue the baseline is normally de\ufb01ned as an estimate of the electricity that would have been consumed by a customer in the absence of a demand-response event [59, 60]. for example, in the \ufb01rst case study, the transactive control method enables the demand response. the aggregator that optimally generates the energy schedule is an operation in the absence of a demand-response event. thus, the opti- mized energy schedule of the aggregators will be used as a baseline in the transactive control method, to prevent grid constraint violation. however, aggregators may not make the energy schedule optimal. instead, they can procure the electricity based on the customer\u2019s power usage pattern. under this circumstance, the customer\u2019s normal daily pro\ufb01les will be used as a baseline. nevertheless, more research is needed to characterize the baseline, since it will be very important in the settlement stage. 7 conclusions in summary, from a demand response-enabling approach to a power system operational principle, the transactive control framework has shown its distinctive capability to incorporate der users\u2019 priorities, needs, or costs that accommodate the high penetration of distributed energy resources smoothly into future power systems. the implementation methods of transactive control include a one-time information exchange-based approach, and an iterative information exchange-based method. these two methods have been used widely in the literature and demonstration projects. note that, for a hierarchical transactive control system, it is possible to combine both implementation methods, such as using the one-time information method on lower levels, and having an itera- tive information exchange method in the upper levels. finally, there is also a need for policymakers to better understand the relationship between pricing schemes and control systems, as it relates to distributed energy resources to ensure proper market structures and rules, to maintain a highly reliable and clean energy system. the current development trend is to integrate all the energy networks together, to hedge against the intermit- tency brought about by the increasing penetration of renewable energy. the ultimate goal of this development would be a so-called \u2018\u2018energy internet\u2019\u2019, where energy can be polled and sent from anyone, anywhere, at any time. the operation of such a system would involve more par- ticipants from different energy networks than the ones seen today. the incentives for participation would be from some designed market mechanisms and eventually, the system operation would be based on handling various energy offers and requests from all the participants. in the opera- tion, all the participants, including the grid operators, will come with their own objectives, as well as constraints, for participation. the problem will become highly complex, including concerns from both economic and technical aspects. such situations may be suitable for the application of transactive control principles. acknowledgement the authors thank pamela macdougall
