      "database to comprehensively review and identify: (1) the current knowledge available regarding the occupational risks associated with pv installations, (2) the health and safety effects these risks have on pv installers, (3) the research being done to mitigate them, and (4) the knowledge gaps for future research. this research can guide areas for future research concerning occupational safety and health in the pv installation sector. 1. introduction keeping workers safe is crucial yet exceptionally challenging when solar installation companies are simply popping up and expanding at staggering rates across the country as a means to capitalize on the market. within the last decade, solar energy has emerged as one of the fastest-growing energy sources in the country. currently, solar accounts for 48% of all new electricity generating capacity in the us, with over 77 gigawatts (gw) of photovoltaics (pv) installed and 100 gw projected by 2025. with this growth, the solar industry\u2019s market worth exceeds $130 billion and, within the last decade alone, added 156,000 new jobs (solar energy industries associations, 2020; gupta & bais, 2019). a key component in the growth and success of the solar industry is the pv installation sector,\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 19\\n\\n3 which makes up 67% of all solar employment (the solar foundation, 2021). according to the us bureau of labor statistics (2020), the fastest-growing occupation is a pv installer at a rate of 63% in the next decade. various states across the country are dedicating themselves to 100% renewable energy by specific year deadlines, such as rhode island, hawaii, virginia, and washington, dc, aiming to significantly utilize pv systems to achieve this goal (national resources defense council, 2020). this same level of growth is being experienced globally as well. in recent years, pv production has experienced the largest increase in net generating capacity amongst all the major energy sources (including wind, hydropower, and gas) (solar power europe, 2019). with this commitment to increasing pv installations globally, the continuous development of a health and safety culture within the pv installation sector is essential. the occupational risks experienced by pv installers are known to have a significant and widespread impact on the us workforce. according to the occupational safety and health administration (osha), pv installers are exposed to occupational risks including but not limited to: (i) musculoskeletal disorder (msd) risks from repetitive work at awkward postures, (ii) falls from elevated working surfaces, (iii) electrical risks and hazards (e.g., electric shock, burns, electrocution, and arc flash hazards), and (iv) heat stress from working for prolonged periods in hot temperatures (osha, n.d.; solar energy industries association [seia], 2006). in recent years work-related musculoskeletal injuries have accounted for approximately 30% of days-away-from-work cases in the us private industry (us bureau of labor statistics, 2019; us bureau of labor statistics, 2018; us bureau of labor statistics, 2016). fall accidents and electrocutions have historically been\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 20\\n\\n4 part of the construction industry\u2019s \u2018fatal four\u2019 (the four most frequent causes of fatalities in the construction industry) (albert et al., 2020; osha, 2011; us department of labor, 1990). additionally, over 600 people are killed from extreme heat annually (center for disease control and prevention, 2019), with workers in the construction industry historically being 13 times more likely to die from heat-related illnesses (hris) than other industries (gubernot et al., 2015). injuries resulting from these risks can lead to a loss of income, a decrease in productivity, an increase in workers\u2019 compensation premiums for employers, discomfort, pain, and death (fatality assessment and control evaluation program [face], 2020; national institute for occupational safety and health [niosh], 2013; seia, 2006). consequently, clear and transparent injury tracking and investigations of these risks within the pv installation sector can play an important role in developing strategies to improve worker safety. there is a lack of official accident reports detailing the causes and effects of the various safety risks pv installers experience during installations. over the years, available reports of pv installer accidents tend to focus on solar worker fall and electrocution injuries (osha 2020; osha 2018; face, 2019; face 2010; face 2009a; face 2009b), and rarely on other occupational risks, such as msds or hris that solar installers are likely to experience due to the nature of the work (osha, n.d.; solar energy industries association [seia], 2006). this lack of reporting indicates and contributes to a lack of awareness of the multitude of risk factors associated with installing pv systems. additionally, the available pv installer accident reports point out that insufficient use of engineering controls (e.g., use of guardrails, skylight screens, covers, nets); administrative controls (e.g., job\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 21\\n\\n5 hazards analysis training, situational awareness training), and personal protective equipment (ppe) are significant causes of injuries and fatalities. hence, more research is needed that reviews the safety risks and mitigation measures associated with pv installation work. there is progress in the published literature regarding identifying the occupational risks pv installers face, however, more research is needed to comprehensively understand these risks and the best means to mitigate them. although previous research has reviewed the hazards and aggravating factors associated with the industry, the work tends to be part of a larger study of the occupational risks present during the entire life-cycle of pv systems (bakhiyi et al., 2014; erten & utlu, 2020; hanson & thatcher, 2020), thus, providing only a brief review pv installation occupational risks. other more detailed literature reviews tend to focus on unique risks, and do not provide research solutions that consider the comprehensive effects of multiple risks (aram et al., 2021; lu et al., 2018; wu et al., 2020), or lack information regarding the current research being done to mitigate these risks and the defining areas where more research is needed (casta\u00f1on et al., 2019). therefore, this systematic literature review aims to comprehensively review: (1) the current knowledge available regarding the occupational risks associated with pv installations, (2) the health and safety effects these risks have on pv installers, (3) the research being done to mitigate them, and (4) the knowledge gaps for future research. this review can serve as a guide for future investigations into the occupational injuries associated with pv installations. furthermore, it can help occupational safety, and health professionals develop safety protocols that improve the overall safety and productivity of pv installers.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 22\\n\\n6 2. methodology a systematic literature review was conducted to gather findings and identify research gaps regarding workers\u2019 health and safety during pv installations. the primary source of information for this literature review were journal articles. the scopus database is one of the most extensively used databases for conducting literature reviews in construction and safety management (varghese et al., 2018; xia et al., 2020; zhou et al., 2015) and was used to conduct the search. the literature search was conducted based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (prisma) checklist (moher et al., 2009) using the keywords, and inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined in table 1. first, articles whose titles were consistent with the inclusion and exclusion criteria were identified, and duplicate articles were removed. then the article abstracts, and subsequently the full-text articles were screened. finally, articles that matched the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in the study.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 23\\n\\n7 table 1 systematic literature search guidelines steps description of steps explicit research question what are the occupational risks associated with pv installations and what research is being done to mitigate them? type of literature journal articles database scopus keywords four groups of keywords were used and combined in multiple combinations in the search: group 1 - solar energy: solar, photovoltaic, pv group 2 - safety: injury, hazard, risk, health, accident, safe group 3 - mode: installation, construction, installer, install group 4 - specific risk terms: heat stress, stress, fall, height, shock, burn, electrocution, wound, cut, laceration, fire, ergonomic, manual, repetitive, handling, awkward, posture inclusion and exclusion criteria -the study deals with safety risks present during pv installations -the study is written in english -no limit was set for the time and location of the study\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 24\\n\\n8 3. results initially, 148 articles were identified, based on their title, as consistent with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. then after duplicate articles were removed, 95 articles remained. by screening the abstract of these 95 articles, only 52 articles were consistent with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. next, the full-text articles were thoroughly screened, and as a result, 29 journal articles were selected as part of this review. articles that were excluded during the abstract and full-text article screening mainly because: (1) the article did not contain specific information regarding pv installation worker safety risks; (2) the article solely focused on the environmental impact associated with pv occupational risks and did not focus on its impact on worker safety; (3) the article focused solely on occupational risk present during the manufacturing of pv panels. table 2 shows a comprehensive breakdown of the contributions of the selected articles towards the occupational safety of pv installations. the main occupational risk/hazard categories presented in these studies are: falls from heights, falling objects, electric shock and burns, traffic accidents, struck by or against materials, ergonomic risks, wounds, lacerations, strains, sprains, thermal burns, and fire risks. for simplicity, the following sections will explore these risks in more detail under the headings: (i) electrical and fire hazards, (ii) heat stress, (iii) fall accidents, impact, and manual handling risks.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 25\\n\\n9 table 2 occupational risks, causes, and mitigation measures\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 26\\n\\n10 3.2. electrical and fire hazards electrical and fire hazards were the most prominently cited risks in the selected studies. the majority of the research currently being done to mitigate pv installation risks is about electrical and fire safety. sreenath et al. (2020), ranganath et al. (2020), and guerin (2017) explore the hazards present in large-scale pv systems. sreenath et al. (2020) performed a risk assessment to identify the risk of pv installations in airports on aviation safety. their assessment identified electrical hazards as a significant risk to safety and provided preventive mitigation measures for them. they explain that electric shock risks may occur from vital electrical pv components coming into contact with workers. since pv systems are challenging to de-energize once energized and exposed to sunlight (levins, 1986; wybo, 2013), they present shock risks to workers. sreenath et al. (2020) also explain that short circuit ruptures in the string or combiner box can lead to fire outbreaks, especially around flammable materials (wybo, 2013). the remaining references focus on fire risks concerning rooftop pv installations. for example, multiple articles studied the effect of pv tilt angle and panel-roof distance on reducing the potential of fire outbreaks associated with pv installations (ju et al., 2019; kristensen et al., 2021; kristensen & jomaas, 2018). at the same time, other studies focused on improving the junction box design (huang et al., 2018) or module backsheet design to reduce fire risks (cancelliere et al., 2014). in order to mitigate electrical and fire hazards, the use of underground electric cables, regular inspection of wires for short circuit signs, and materials near installations for\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 27\\n\\n11 flammability (ju et al., 2019; ranganath et al., 2020; sreenath et al., 2020). studies also recommended applying an internet of things (iot) based panel maintenance system for remote monitoring and data sensing to improve the efficiency of fault detection (appiah et al., 2019; ranganath et al., 2020), however, this is an area for research focus. ju et al. (2019) and kristensen et al. (2021) also infer that increasing the panel tilt angle and panel- roof distance can reduce flame propagation in order to mitigate fires. although these protocols are effective, it is essential to consider the effect of heat from sun exposure on installers. 3.2. heat stress heat stress was only identified by one of the studies as a risk during pv installations. heat- related injuries such as dehydration, heat exhaustion, heatstroke can occur from working in hot temperatures for prolonged periods. samaniego-rasc\u00f3n et al. (2019) performed a risk assessment utilizing the wet-bulb globe temperature and work intensity (kcal/h) to determine a healthy work/rest schedule for solar workers. they indicate the importance of workers gradually acclimatizing to the heat and the workload. as a guide, they conclude that for unacclimatized workers, when the work intensity is 400 kcal/h (heavy work), they need to rest for 75% of each hour, however, when the work intensity of 300 kcal/h (moderate work) need to rest for 50% of each hour. on the other hand, for acclimatized workers, when the work intensity is 200 kcal/h (light work), they can reach 100% of the work hour, however when the work intensity of 500 kcal/h (very heavy work) can reach 50% of the work per hour.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 28\\n\\n12 3.3. fall accidents, impact, and manual handling risks selected studies rarely identified falls, slips and trips, impact, and manual handling risks as hazards/risks during pv installations. impact risks include traffic accidents on-site or being struck by or against objects (bakhiyi et al., 2014). ho et al. (2020) applied prevention through design (ptd) techniques to rooftop pv systems. erten & utlu (2020) also identifies falling from a height as a hazard and recommends using fall protection ppe to mitigate this risk. ho et al. (2020) developed ptd for roofing materials, roof slopes, roof accessories, panel layouts, fall protection systems, and lifting methods. however, more research is needed to understand the manual handling risks pv installers are exposed to and the means to mitigate them. 4. conclusion this paper performs a systematic literature review to identify the current research knowledge and mitigation measures regarding the occupational risks associated with pv installations. after reviewing 29 articles, the occupational risks associated with pv installations were discovered as electrical and fire hazards, heat stress, fall accidents, impact, and manual handling risks. based on the literature search, it is clear that most of the research done to mitigate the pv installation hazards are in the fire and electrical safety realm. few papers address fall accidents, ergonomic and manual handling risks, and impact risks; however, extensive study is being done to apply ptd principles to mitigate fall risks in rooftop installations. in addition, more research is needed to understand the manual handling risks pv installers face. other areas to be explored are the potential musculoskeletal disorders from extensive and large-bulk material handling, and visual stress from bright and reflective environments.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 29\\n\\n13 a key observation regarding this study is that the literature regarding occupational risks in the pv industry was fairly new, thus implying the start of a movement to quantify and understand how human factors and ergonomics can impact the worker occupational health and safety in a solar energy installation environment. a limitation of this study is that it utilizes only one database for the literature search. future work can include using various relevant databases. also, surveying pv installers to understand their perception of the occupational risks they experience and how this influences their safety and financial decisions. there is a recent trend to quantify and understand how human factors and ergonomics can assist in sustainability, let alone renewable energies. this paper contributes to this effort by outlining the current state of where we are as a society to help the significant influx of solar installers.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 30\\n\\n14 acknowledgements thank you to the university of rhode island\u2019s sustainable innovative solutions (sis) lab for their unwavering support. a special thanks to the penn state solar fab collaborative and dr. frey brownson for their guidance and encouragement.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 31\\n\\n15 references (*articles in review) *appiah, a. y., zhang, x., ayawli, b.b. k., & kyeremeh, f.

solar power europe, 2021). in recent years, solar production has experienced the largest global increase in net generating capacity, contributing over 35% of net power generating capacity (solar power europe, 2019, 2021). in the united states (u.s.), solar has experienced an average annual growth of 42%, with over 100 gigawatts of installed capacity (solar energy industries associations, 2020). this growth is likely to continue, especially with various states (e.g., rhode island, hawaii, virginia, california, and new mexico) across the u.s. dedicating themselves to over 60% of renewable energy electricity generation by specific deadlines, aiming to significantly utilize solar photovoltaic (pv) systems to achieve this goal (national resources defense council, 2020). consequently, the u.s. solar workforce is projected to expand rapidly and is \u201con [the] trajectory to reach 400,000 solar jobs by 2030\u201d (irec, 2021b, p.3). a key component in the growth and success of the solar industry is the pv installation sector, which makes up 67% of all solar employment (irec, 2021b). according to the u.s. bureau of labor statistics (2021), \u201cemployment of solar photovoltaic installers is projected to grow 52 percent from 2020 to 2030, much faster than the average for all occupations.\u201d with this commitment to increasing pv installations, the continuous development of health and safety knowledge and culture within the pv installation sector is essential. photovoltaic installers are known to experience some of the most significant and widespread construction-related occupational safety risks (occupational safety and health administration [osha], 2011; u. s. department of labor, 2017a,b,c). these risks include:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 39\\n\\n23 (i) musculo- skeletal disorder (msd) risks from repetitive work at awkward postures, (ii) falls from elevated working surfaces, (iii) electrical risks and hazards (e.g., electric shock, burns, electrocution, and arc flash hazards), and (iv) heat stress from working for prolonged periods in hot temperatures (hanson & thatcher, 2020; u.s. department of labor, 2017a). in recent years, work-related musculoskeletal injuries have accounted for approximately 30% of days-away-from-work cases in the u.s. private industry (u.s. bureau of labor statistics, 2016, 2018, 2019). furthermore, fall accidents and electrocutions have historically been part of the construction industry\u2019s \u2018fatal four,\u2019 also called the four most frequent causes of fatalities in the construction industry (albert et al., 2020; osha, 2011). additionally, over 600 people are killed from extreme heat annually on average (centers for disease control and prevention, 2019), with construction industry workers historically having the highest proportion (36.8%) of heat-related illness (hri) deaths (gubernot et al., 2015). nevertheless, there is still a lack of formalized reporting and verification of solar worker accident data, frequency, cause, fatalities, and property damage associated with the impact of these risks in the solar industry (sovacool et al., 2015). photovoltaic installer accident investigation reporting and verification are limited (sovacool et al., 2015). available reports of pv installer accidents over the years tend to focus on fall and electrocution injuries (california fatality assessment and control evaluation program, 2020; osha, 2018, 2020) and rarely on other occupational risks (e.g., msds or hris) that workers are also likely to experience due to the nature of pv installation work (oregon solar energy industries association, 2006; u. s. department of labor, 2017a,b,c). this lack of reporting indicates and contributes to a lack of awareness of the risk factors associated with installing pv systems. additionally, available pv\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 40\\n\\n24 installer accident reports (california fatality assessment and control evaluation program, 2020; osha, 2018, 2020) highlight insufficient use of engineering controls (e.g., use of guardrails, skylight screens, covers, nets); administrative controls (e.g., job hazards analysis training, situational awareness training), and personal protective equipment (ppe) as significant contributors to pv installer injuries and fatalities. hence, reviewing the safety risks and controls or risk mitigation measures associated with pv installations is crucial to continuously educate pv installers regarding the most effective safety practices on-site. previous research in the solar safety realm that has explored safety risk detection and mitigation has mainly focused on mitigating fire risks (aram et al., 2021; lu et al., 2018a; ong et al., 2022; wang et al., 2021; wu et al., 2020). for instance, ong et al. (2022) attempted to understand if pv systems pose an additional fire risk to buildings during their operations. through conducting a bowtie analysis of rooftop grid-connected pv systems, ong et al. (2022) found that the main contributors to fire incidents during the operation of pv systems were arc faults and improper installation of pv systems. wang et al. (2021) also utilized fault tree analysis, regression analysis, and machine learning to propose a photovoltaic failure probability model capable of providing early warning for fault occurrences in utility-scale solar systems, thereby mitigating fire risks. safety risk mitigation research that explores other solar safety risks seems to be emerging. there is progress in the published literature regarding identifying the various occupational risks associated with solar workers during pv installations. however, a comprehensive literature review that explores the risks, mitigation measures, and potential research areas associated with pv installation safety is lacking. previous literature reviews have identified\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 41\\n\\n25 some risks and aggravating factors related to solar installation work (bakhiyi et al., 2014; erten & utlu, 2020; hanson & thatcher, 2020). however, these works tend to be part of a larger study of the occupational risks present during the entire life-cycle of pv systems (bakhiyi et al., 2014; erten & utlu, 2020; hanson & thatcher, 2020); thus, the works provide only a brief review of pv installation occupational risks. in addition, more detailed literature reviews have tended to only focus on unique risks, such as fire and electrical risks (aram et al., 2021; lu et al., 2018a; wu et al., 2020), or have been geared towards a specific installation type, such as floating solar photovoltaic projects (sen et al., 2021). therefore, there is a lack of clarity regarding the relationships and comprehensive effects multiple risks have on pv installation safety in various contexts and settings and the research and safety measures needed to mitigate these risks. this study performs a systematic literature review that aims to comprehensively answer the following research questions: (1) what are the occupational risks associated with pv installations?; (2) what health and safety effects do these risks have on pv installers?; (3) what research is being conducted to mitigate these risks?; and (4) what potential research areas need to be pursued? this review can serve as a guide for future investigations into the occupational injuries associated with pv installations. moreover, it can aid occupational safety and health professionals along with various installation stakeholders (i.e., installation and insurance companies) as they develop safety protocols to improve pv installers\u2019 overall safety and productivity.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 42\\n\\n26 2. methods a systematic literature review was conducted to gather findings regarding occupational risks, health and safety effects, and current and potential safety research areas. a systematic literature review is a process that utilizes methodical and explicit techniques to select, review, and analyze literature based on a pre-formulated research question (moher et al., 2010). a systematic review is distinct from a meta-analysis because it refers to the entire process of searching, selecting, evaluating, and synthesizing findings from various literature (ahn & kang, 2018). a meta-analysis is usually a step in the systematic review process that involves using a statistical approach to analyze data and information from various research articles to attain a pooled outcome (haidich, 2010). a meta-analysis requires the articles being analyzed to possess heterogeneity (i.e., the articles being analyzed have sufficiently similar methods and outcomes; ahn & kang, 2018; lorenc et al., 2016). this systematic review does not conduct a meta-analysis because it is open to articles that possess a wide variety of methods (e.g., literature review, experiment, risk assessment) and outcomes. however, this systematic review follows the detailed process of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (prisma) guidelines (moher et al., 2009; moher et al., 2010) with an awareness of how current systematic reviews have applied these techniques (ayodele et al., 2020; garrisson et al., 2021; xia et al., 2018, 2020). figure 1 illustrates the systematic review process that was conducted in this study. since systematic reviews can vary based on the research question, type of study (qualitative or quantitative), and field of study, there is no clear minimal requirement for the number of studies that can be included in a systematic review (moher et al., 2009; moher et al., 2010). this systematic review was conducted in three phases:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 43\\n\\n27 planning and computer search, eligibility evaluation, and content analysis to comprehensively answer the research questions. the planning and computer search phase (section 2.1) involved selecting the most relevant databases, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and keywords (table 3) to search for literature that could answer the research questions. then during the eligibility evaluation phase (section 2.2), a literature search was conducted using relevant keywords and databases. the identified literature was then screened and was either accepted or rejected based on its consistency with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. finally, during the content analysis phase (section 2.3), each article was reviewed in detail, and key information from each article was extracted manually and coded into ten categories in a spreadsheet (see table 4). then the coded articles\u2019 information was grouped according to the occupational safety risks they addressed (figure 2). articles that addressed similar risks were reviewed collectively to answer the research questions. an overview of the selected articles is presented in the results of systematic literature review (section 3). the main findings and discussions regarding safety risks, mitigation measures, current and future research from this review are presented in the discussion of risk categories and call for future research (section 4), grouped by the safety risk categories identified in the content analysis.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 44\\n\\n28 2.1. phase 1: planning and computer search during this study\u2019s planning and computer search phase, the databases, research questions, and inclusion and exclusion criteria were determined to select the most relevant literature. this review was conducted using the scopus, web of science, science direct, and pubmed databases. these databases were selected because they contain the main peer-reviewed journals in the construction and safety management fields and have frequently been used for construction and safety management-related literature reviews (varghese et al., 2018; xia et al., 2018, 2020; zhou et al., 2015). the primary inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study were to select peer-reviewed journal articles available in english, that explicitly detailed information regarding risks, mitigation measures, or research relevant to the safety of pv installers. to ensure quality",
