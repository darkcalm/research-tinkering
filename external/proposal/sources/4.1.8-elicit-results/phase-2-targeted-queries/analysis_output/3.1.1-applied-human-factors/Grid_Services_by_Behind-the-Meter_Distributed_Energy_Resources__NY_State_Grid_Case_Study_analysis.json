(ii) realistic distribution feeder models with over 9,000 nodes each, simulated in a dss, (iii) ders such as photovoltaic (pv), energy storage (es), water heaters, and hvac, simu- lated in stand-alone der simulator tools, and (iv) a derms responsible for issuing commands to the der simulators to request the devices to provide grid services. fig. 2. proposed t&d co-simulation framework. note openderms, displayed in fig. 2, is a web application developed by the electric power research institute (epri). it can aggregate, control, and manage many ders to pro- vide grid support services. it supports various communication protocols such as the cta-2045 standard with energy star speci\ufb01cations, dnp3, and sunspec modbus for large scale der interoperability and evaluating different control strate- gies. in addition, the tool includes grid support function tem- plates such as connect/disconnect, volt-var support, frequency- watt support, etc. it can be \ufb02exibly customized for testing several control functions and observing their impacts when co- simulated with dss. for our testing methodology, the open- derms tool was customized to receive time synchronization data via mqtt protocol and issue the control setpoints to the interconnected ders via dnp3. the communication architecture of the proposed rt t&d co-simulation framework is based on mqtt communication protocol [12], which is ideal for internet of things appli- cations [13]. figure 3 demonstrates how the data exchange between the rts, the dss, and the openderms platform is performed via the mqtt broker, which is an intermedi- ary agent responsible for receiving messages published by clients, \ufb01ltering messages by topic, and distributing them to subscribers. note openderms is responsible for adjusting devices power setpoints based on grid service commands requested by grid operators. a more in-detail explanation of how the data exchange and time synchronization has been implemented in the proposed testbed is provided in [11]. fig. 3. the power system variables exchanged between rts, dss, and openderms in one instance of the co-simulation loop iii. simulation results in this work, two main studies are presented: (a) an analysis of the ders\u2019 impact on the system wide frequency response in cases with high der penetration, and (b) an analysis of the capability of btm ders in tracking an agc regulation signal. in both studies, 12 synchronous generators from the nys bps (equivalent to 2.878 gw) have been displaced by ders to represent a future scenario of increased der participation. for simplicity, the ders consists only of pv generation. a. impact of ders on system wide frequency response in this case, the rt t&d co-simulation platform is com- posed by the 5,000 buses bps and two 9,500-node distribution feeders with 500 ders connected to each. a permanent three- phase to ground fault is applied to the transmission network,\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 3\\n\\nfig. 4. three-phase to ground fault scenario studied. followed by the outage of subtransmission lines leading to the isolation of the fault as well as a load shedding of 400 mw just below the central nys. the event causes the tripping of the main corridors between the southeast nys and upstate ny. figure 4 highlights the location of the fault. to highlight the impact of ders on the system wide frequency response, the following use cases are subjected to the described scenario. \u2022 base case: represents a traditional power system. in this case, the synchronous generators are not substituted by ders. \u2022 case 1: represents a power system with ders not provid- ing grid services. in this case, 2.878 gw of synchronous generation capacity from the nys is replaced by ders that operate in grid-following mode without frequency- watt droop response. \u2022 case 2: represents the future power system with ders providing grid services required by standards [4]. in this case, the same amount of synchronous generation from case 1 is retired. however, the ders are equipped with frequency-watt droop capabilities to help the grid during frequency events. figure 5 displays the aggregated total active power con- sumption from the distribution feeders in each use case during the contingency scenario. note cases 1 and 2 present negative power demand due to the der power injection through the feeders. as seen in the \ufb01gure, the power consumption is approximately constant in the base case and case 1; however, it presents large oscillations in case 2. this is because of the frequency droop controllers responsible for adjusting the output of the ders in response to system frequency variations. results show the ders can considerably assist the grid during the fault event in case 2. figure 6 displays the system frequency for each use case. although almost 3 gw of synchronous generation was replaced by ders in cases 1 and 2, the total system inertia was not signi\ufb01cantly impacted. this can be observed by comparing the frequency response during the fault recovery between the use cases. during the \ufb01rst minute of simulation, all three cases present similar frequency oscillations, ranging fig. 5. total active power contribution from the distribution feeders hosting ders. between approximately 59.2 to 61.25 hz. this is because the transmission system in study corresponds to a section of the whole eastern interconnection grid, with very high inertia. fig. 6. system frequency in response to the sudden load drop caused by the contingency. as shown in fig. 6, the system is able to maintain stability after the fault in the base case, in which no synchronous machine was retired. nevertheless, the lack of any frequency response from the ders in case 1 caused the system to oscillate and lose stability around 70 seconds of simulation. noticeably, simulation results between 70 to 100 seconds of simulation demonstrate how ders equipped with frequency droop controllers (case 2) can not only damp the post-event oscillations but also help the frequency to settle at a steady- state closer to its nominal value when compared to the base case. this example highlights the importance of having ders following grid standards such as ieee 1547-2018 to ensure grid stability during contingency events. it is worth mentioning that the grid frequency in display has been measured at a bus in the central nys region. b. agc signal tracking with ders in this case, the rt t&d co-simulation platform is com- posed by the 5,000 buses bps and 10 distribution systems con- nected to different buses of the bps, in which each distribution\\n\\n---\\n\\n### page 4\\n\\nsystem corresponds to 92 ieee 123 node test feeders con- nected in parallel. the same amount of synchronous machine generation from the previous study is retired, such that the total der power injection (represented as pv systems) corresponds to 2.878 gw when the pvs operate at rated power. the reason behind having speci\ufb01cally 92 feeders in parallel is to have the overall distribution system output matching the power injection from the retired synchronous machines. since there is a limit for the pv hosting capacity before reaching overvoltage issue",
