Introduction: The construction industry is regarded as one of the most unsafe occupational ﬁelds worldwide. Despite general agreement that safety training is an important factor in preventing accidents in the
construction sector, more studies are needed to identify effective training methods. To address the current research gap, this study evaluated the impact of novel, participatory safety training methods on construction workers’ safety competencies. Speciﬁcally, we assessed the efﬁcacy of an immersive virtual
reality (VR)-based safety training program and a participatory human factors safety training program
(HFST) in construction industry workplaces. Method: In 2019, 119 construction sector workers from eight
workplaces participated in a randomized controlled trial conducted in Finland. All the study participants
were assessed using questionnaires at baseline, immediately after the intervention and at one-month
follow-up. We applied generalized linear mixed modeling for statistical analysis. Results: Compared to
lecture-based safety training, VR-based safety training showed a stronger impact on safety motivation,
self-efﬁcacy and safety-related outcome expectancies. In addition, the construction sector workers
who participated in the VR-based safety training showed a greater increase in self-reported safety performance at one-month follow-up. Contrary to our study hypotheses, we found no signiﬁcant differences
between the study outcomes in terms of study participants in the HFST training condition and the comparison condition without HFST training. Conclusion: Our study indicates that VR technology as a safety
training tool has potential to increase safety competencies and foster motivational change in terms of the
safety performance of construction sector workers. In the future, the efﬁcacy of participatory human factors safety training should be studied further using a version that targets both managerial and employee
levels and is implemented in a longer format. Practical implications: Safety training in virtual reality provides a promising alternative to passive learning methods. Its motivating effect complements other safety
training activities.

1. Introduction
The construction industry has a high risk of occupational accidents and injuries and is regarded as one of the most unsafe industries worldwide (Pinto, Nunes, & Ribeiro, 2011; Zhou, Goh, & Li,
2015). Previous studies (Pinto, Nunes, & Ribeiro, 2011; Guo et al.,
2012) highlight the lack of occupational safety training as one of
the major factors behind the poor level of occupational safety in
the construction industry. The importance of safety training for
enhancing workers’ safety competencies has also been emphasized
in previous review articles (Ricci et al., 2016; Robson et al., 2012).
Glendon et al. (2006) highlight several elements of occupational
safety training that can signiﬁcantly improve its effectiveness.
These include the use of photographs and demonstrations, as well
as the active participation of workers and various simulations of
work situations. Participatory and engaging learning methods in
particular have been found to be more effective than more passive
safety training approaches (e.g., lectures; Burke et al., 2006, 2011).
Participatory safety training is based on active participation on the
part of learners and utilizes reﬂection and dialogue as a means of
knowledge and skills development (Burke et al., 2006). Despite
general agreement that safety training is an important factor for
preventing accidents in the construction sector, we need more
studies to identify effective training methods (see van der Molen
et al., 2018).

To address the current research gaps, the present randomizedcontrolled trial (RCT) assessed the impact of novel and participatory safety training methods on construction workers’ safety competencies.
Speciﬁcally,
we
assessed:
(a)
the
efﬁcacy
of
an
immersive virtual reality-based safety training program, and (b)
the efﬁcacy of a participatory human factors safety training program in construction industry workplaces.
The purpose was to provide information that can be used in the
construction industry when considering choices in terms of safety
training methods. This RCT was pre-registered and the rationale,
hypotheses and methods of this study were deﬁned previously
(Anonymous, 20xx). This study focused on the efﬁcacy and process
evaluation of intervention processes, and its report followed CONSORT guidelines (Schulz et al., 2010).
1.1. VR-based safety training
In the general sense, virtual reality (VR) refers to a computergenerated artiﬁcial 3D environment (Li et al., 2018). New technologies such as virtual reality offer tools for developing engaging
methods of safety training. Speciﬁcally, VR provides potential for
emphasizing the active role of the learner during safety training
activities (Lee, Wong, & Fung, 2010). A basic distinction has been
made
between
immersive
VR
and
non-immersive
VR
(see
Plechatá et al., 2019). Immersion refers to the extent to which a virtual environment is capable of delivering an inclusive, extensive,
and vivid illusion to the human senses (Slater & Wilbur, 1997). A
key difference between non-immersive and immersive VR is
related to the level of interaction between the user and the VR
environment. Non-immersive VR is often based on technologies
such as computer desktops or tablet screens. In these cases, the virtual environment is viewed through a computer screen and people
use a keyboard to control their movements in the virtual environment. Thus, users can see the contents of the virtual environment
but have limited capabilities to interact with the environment.
Immersive VR utilizes more advanced technologies such as VR
headsets and systems that track head and body movements. In
immersive VR, the user interacts with the computer-generated
environment by physically moving and manipulating objects using
motion-tracking devices. Although VR as a concept is not particularly new in safety training, the use of immersive VR technology
in safety training is not yet widespread (Grabowski & Jankowski,
2015). The development of VR hardware and software is making
immersive VR-based safety training a feasible option for delivering
workplace safety training. Safety learning based on immersive VR
has received a considerable amount of attention in the construction sector in recent years. (Li et al., 2018).
Empirical evidence to support the effectiveness of VR-based
safety training is rather limited (see Gao et al., 2019). Also, evidence concerning the beneﬁts of VR-based safety training is limited and has often focused on students, apprentices, or young
workers. The few previous studies available have shown mixed
results. Sacks, Perlman, and Barak (2013) found that immersive
VR safety training had a beneﬁcial impact on safety-related knowledge acquisition among construction workers with limited work
experience and civil engineering students. In their RCT study, the
participants used a VR headset and a hand-held controller. Using
a non-randomized study design, Gheisari and Esmaeli (2019) found
that VR-based safety training using a computer desktop platform
enhanced the hazard recognition skills of construction sector trainees. In a randomized-controlled trial by Leder et al. (2019), participants used a VR headset and a wireless controller to navigate and
interact in the VR environment. Using an apprentice student sample, they found that safety training outcomes in risk perception did
not differ according to whether the training had been immersive
VR-based safety training or training using Power Point slides. In
our study, we focus on applications of immersive virtual reality.
Therefore, in the following chapters, VR safety training refers to
training based on immersive VR technology, which allows users
to interact with the computer-generated environment.
1.2. Human factor perspective in safety training
Another relatively new concept in safety science is related to
applying the holistic human factors perspective in safety training.
This perspective is important to acknowledge in safety training
processes because human behavior plays a role in most workplace
accidents (Ford & Tetrick, 2008). Furthermore, Teperi, Puro, and
Ratilainen (2017) and Teperi et al. (2015) have shown that learning
to recognize human factors at work has positive outcomes for
safety skills. However, few studies have explored the outcomes
of safety training based on human factors in construction sector
workplaces. In our study, we implemented a human factors safety
training program with a participatory and holistic approach (HFST
training). The holistic approach means that the safety training
addresses the role of human activity at various levels: the individual level (e.g., attitudes), group level (e.g., information ﬂow), and
the organizational level (e.g., resources). HFST training guides
workers towards identifying the promoting or hindering effect of
human factors in safety.
2. Conceptual background
Our evaluation framework utilized social cognitive theory
(Bandura, 1977, 1997; Rotter, 1966, 1982) and the theory of
planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991). These psychological theories have
been used previously in safety research by Guerin et al. (2019),
Casey, Krauss, and Turner (2018), and Nykänen, Sund, and Vuori
(2018). The key concepts of our evaluation framework included
safety self-efﬁcacy, safety locus of control, outcome expectancies,
safety knowledge, and safety motivation. Previous empirical studies have shown that these individual-level factors play an important
role
in
safety
performance
and
safety
outcomes
(e.g.
accidents) (Christian et al., 2009; Jones & Wuebker, 1993; KatzNavon et al., 2007; Neal & Grifﬁn, 2006; Arezes & Miguel, 2008).
Thus, they are important targets of safety training efforts among
the construction sector workforce. Next, we describe the key concepts of our evaluation framework.
2.1. Individual-level safety competencies
Knowledge of preventive action is a strong determinant of
safety behavior at the workplace (Grifﬁn & Neal, 2000). According
to a deﬁnition by Christian et al. (2009), safety knowledge refers to
knowing how to perform work safely (e.g., safety procedures, using
protective equipment). However, increasing safety knowledge is
not enough to impact on behavior. Individuals must acknowledge
their personal role in safety, identify the beneﬁts of a particular
preventive action, and be convinced that they can successfully perform the required safety behaviors (see De Joy, 1996; Jones &
Wuebker, 1993). Safety self-efﬁcacy refers to the degree of conﬁdence in one’s ability to perform safety-related activities successfully, such as identifying hazards, recognizing factors that affect
the occurrence of accidents, and using personal protective equipment (see Bandura, 1997; Nykänen, Sund, & Vuori, 2018). According to previous studies (Bandura, 1997), verbal persuasion (e.g.,
positive feedback) and mastery experience, in which an individual
successfully practices a behavior, are key mechanisms for enhancing self-efﬁcacy. Internal safety locus of control refers to the perception that one’s own work behavior plays an important role in
preventing injuries or harmful events. In contrast, external safety

### Page 3

locus of control is related to the belief that accidents happen due to
external factors such as luck or the actions of other people. (Jones &
Wuebker, 1993). A similar concept, ‘‘perceived control over safety
issues” refers to the degree to which people perceive themselves
as affecting safety improvements at the workplace (Curcuruto,
Mearns, & Mariani, 2016). Safety self-efﬁcacy, safety locus of control, and perceived control over safety issues are closely interrelated psychological constructs. Nevertheless, there are a few
distinctions. The safety locus of control measure is related to personal beliefs concerning accidents, and the perceived control over
safety issues is more related to day-to-day safety-related activities
at work (Curcuruto, Mearns, & Mariani, 2016). Furthermore, safety
self-efﬁcacy refers to the degree of conﬁdence in one’s ability to
perform a speciﬁc safety-related task or activity and safety locus
of control is an attribution toward safety outcomes in general. It
refers to perceptions of the location in which one’s control over
accidents or injuries resides. For example, an individual may
acknowledge that accidents are dependent on their behavior but
may
have
low
self-efﬁcacy
for
speciﬁc
preventive
actions
(Nykänen et al., 2019).
By the concept of safety-related outcome expectancies, we refer
to the expected value that workers give to safety-related activities
such as the use of personal protective equipment. Arezes and
Miguel (2008) used a similar concept of outcome value in studying
predictors of the use of hearing protection devices. Previous studies have also emphasized the role of safety motivation as a proximal antecedent for safety performance at workplaces (Christian
et al., 2013). According to Neal, Grifﬁn, and Hart (2000), safety
motivation refers to ‘‘an individual’s willingness to exert effort to
enact safety behaviors and the valence associated with those
behaviors”. Furthermore, safety performance refers to actions or
behaviors that individuals perform to promote health and safety
(Burke, Scheuer, & Meredith, 2007). Previous studies have divided
it into subdimensions that include safety compliance and safety
participation. Safety compliance refers to core safety activities that
need to be carried out by individuals (e.g., using personal protective equipment) and safety participation refers to participating in
voluntary safety activities (Neal, Grifﬁn, & Hart, 2000).
2.2. Participants’ responsiveness to safety training
Previous research has highlighted the importance of examining
implementation processes as part of safety intervention evaluation
(van der Molen, 2007; see Dugan & Punnet, 2017). Exploring intervention delivery adds explanatory value to the efﬁcacy evaluation
(see Carroll et al., 2007). Participant responsiveness has been
deﬁned as an important criterion for evaluating implementation
processes. According to Berkel et al. (2011), participant responsiveness refers to engagement, active participation, interest, and satisfaction related to the intervention program. In this context, we
incorporated an investigation of various aspects of participant
responsiveness in our process evaluation.
The VR-based learning process has its own special features,
which we took into account when evaluating the implementation
process. Immersion and ‘‘sense of presence” have been identiﬁed
as key features of VR-based training (Li et al., 2018). Sense of presence has been deﬁned as the psychological consequence of immersion. It refers to the degree of feeling connected and involved,
absorbed, and engaged in a given virtual environment (Mc Creery
et al., 2013; Slater & Wilbur, 1997; Lombard & Ditton, 1997). Thus,
the sense of presence reﬂects responsiveness to, psychological
engagement in and satisfaction with VR-based safety learning
activities. Moreover, Mantovani and Castelnuovo (2003) highlighted that the sense of presence is a key feature ensuring the efﬁcacy of VR-based training. We evaluated four components of the
sense of presence as active ingredients of a VR learning experience:
(a) Spatial presence, referring to the individual’s perception of
being located in an environment that is conveyed by VR technology; (b) Involvement, deﬁned as the psychological state of focusing
one’s energy and attention on activities and events in the virtual
environment; (c) Realism, referring to the perceived consistency
of the information conveyed by a VR with real-world experience;
and (d) Feeling of control, that is, the perception of control a person
experiences over the task environment or when interacting with
the virtual environment (Witmer & Singer, 1998; Hartmann
et al., 2015).
One deﬁcit of VR learning activity is its potential risk of producing simulator sickness symptoms. Simulator sickness is a syndrome similar to motion sickness (Du_zman´ ska, Strojny, & Strojny,
2018). According to previous studies, simulator sickness symptoms
are common during VR experiences. (see Salzman et al., 1999),
although it is rare that these sickness symptoms are severe or
strong (Bouchard, Robillard, & Renau, 2007; Lawson et al., 2002).
Nevertheless, simulator sickness can limit the efﬁcacy of VRbased
training
and
should
be
monitored
(see
Du_zman´ ska,
Strojny, & Strojny, 2018).
3. Study aims and hypotheses
The ﬁrst aim of this study was to investigate the efﬁcacy of VRbased safety training in comparison to that of trainer-centered
lecture-based safety training. The second aim was to investigate
the impact of the participatory HFST training. Third, we applied
process evaluation to determine whether the intervention activities were implemented as intended. The purpose was to provide
insights into the delivery process of the training processes and to
assess target group responsiveness. The VR-based safety training
and HFST training were both carried out as part of the same RCT
conducted in Finnish construction companies.
In
accordance
with
previously
published
study
methods
(Nykänen et al., 2020), our hypotheses were the following: In comparison to trainer-centered and lecture-based safety training, we
expected VR-based safety training to have a stronger effect on
safety competencies, deﬁned as: (1) safety self-efﬁcacies, (2) safety
locus of control, (3) safety knowledge, (4) safety-related outcome
expectancies, (5) safety motivation, and (6) safety performance.
In addition, we hypothesized that the participatory HFST training
would have a positive impact on (7) safety self-efﬁcacies and (8)
safety-related outcome expectancies and (9) safety knowledge.
4. Study methods
4.1. Study participants
This RCT was implemented in eight Finnish construction sector
workplaces in 2018–2019. To ensure a sufﬁcient number of participants per organization, only medium- and large-sized organizations were recruited. Participation in the study required the
target organizations to make arrangements regarding employees’
work schedules and organize their working time to enable them
to participate in the intervention processes. The research team ﬁrst
identiﬁed potential Finnish construction sector companies that
were considered to have the required personnel resources to participate in the research project. The key inclusion criteria here concerned the size of the organization and having several years of
experience in the construction sector ﬁeld. All the listed companies
also had previous experience in occupational safety development
projects. These factors were expected to support the implementation process and the success of the study’s data collection. During
the recruitment of the workplaces, safety managers were sent an
email containing an invitation to participate in a research project

and informational material regarding the study. If the safety managers were interested, a meeting with the workplace representatives was arranged to present the study process and intervention
methods.
In
all,
21
construction
sector
workplaces
were
approached during the recruitment process. A meeting was
arranged with a total of eight organizations after initial contact
(email and phone call). Eight construction sector organizations
were interested in the research project and agreed to participate.
When the organization decided to participate in the study, an
employee meeting was held to disseminate information on the
study and to recruit participants. Initially, the inclusion criteria
for participation in the study were the following: (a) age between
20 and 50, (b) at least two years of work experience in the construction sector, (c) Finnish as a native language, and (d) current
employment as a construction worker. Eligible employees who
expressed interest in the study were invited to an information presentation by a research team member. In the employee meeting,
the research team members described the study and collected both
written consent forms for participation and the completed baseline
questionnaires. All the participants were volunteers.
Due to recruitment difﬁculties encountered with the ﬁrst two
target organizations, we re-examined our inclusion criteria and
changed the age criteria so that those over 50 years of age were
also admitted to the study. Thus, in terms of age, the participant
inclusion criteria were changed to at least 20 years of age. Altogether,
120
eligible
construction
sector
workers
gave
their
informed consent for the study and participated in the baseline
measurements.
Our study had three measurement time points (baseline, shortterm follow-up, and one-month follow-up). All the study measurements were taken at the workplaces of the participants, where the
research team member handed the paper format questionnaire to
the participants. In one of the target organizations, the baseline
questionnaires were completed electronically during a Skype
employee meeting. The number of workers participating in the
study varied among the organizations from 9 to 20 (M = 15,
SD = 3.25). Both VR safety training and lecture-based safety training took place at the workplaces approximately two weeks after
baseline measurements. The HFST training was also implemented
at the workplaces. Here, the implementation process included
one exception: In one target organization, employees worked in
different cities. For practical reasons, all the safety training sessions
for this organization were held at one location.
4.2. Randomization process and follow-ups
A statistician, who was not involved in contacting the target
organizations
or
the
data
collection
procedures,
used
a
computer-generated randomization method to classify the study
participants into one of four intervention arms after baseline measurements. Stratiﬁed randomization was used to establish equal
intervention conditions in terms of work experience. Randomization was stratiﬁed by work experience: 2–5 years, 6–15 years and
over 15 years. It was conducted separately for each participating
organization. The study participants who were allocated into Intervention arm 1 participated only in the VR-based safety training.
Intervention arm 2 participated only in lecture-based safety training. Intervention arm 3 participated in both the VR-based safety
training and HFST training, and Intervention arm 4 participated
in both lecture-based safety training and HFST training. Given
the nature of the safety training programs, it was not possible to
blind study participants to their condition allocation.
In total, 60 study participants were randomized to participate in
the VR-based safety training and 60 to participate in the lecturebased safety training. The participants were informed whether
they were allocated to the VR-based training or lecture-based
training approximately one week before the training. Furthermore,
59 study participants were randomized to also participate in the
HFST training one month after the VR-based or lecture-based training. The study participants allocated to the HFST training were
informed approximately two weeks before the training. Sixty-one
participants were assigned to the control condition without HFST
training.
At short-term follow-up immediately after the VR-based training and lecture-based training (T2), 110 participants (92.4%) completed the questionnaire. Respectively, 105 participants (88.2%)
completed the questionnaire at one-month follow-up (T3). The
study participants allocated to the HFST training completed the
questionnaire immediately after their training. The control group
without HFST training completed the questionnaire at the equivalent times.
We found no statistically signiﬁcant differences in study outcomes between the respondents who provided follow-up data (at
T2 and T3) and those who provided only baseline measures. Thus,
we considered that the data were missing at random. No-show bias
was controlled for by collecting follow-up data on all the study
participants originally randomized and included in the study. Of
the 60 participants assigned to the VR-based safety training condition, 3.3% did not participate in the training activities but provided
follow-up data at T2, and 10% of the 60 participants randomized to
lecture-based safety training did not participate in the lecturebased safety training but provided data at T2. Furthermore, of
the 59 participants assigned to participate in the HFST training,
6.7% did not participate in HFST training activities but provided
follow-up data at T3. In accordance with the intention-to-treat
principle, we based our analyses on complete randomized intervention data, which included both those who participated in the
training activities and nonparticipants. During data screening, we
removed one multivariate outlier from the analysis due to extreme
negative scores in the study variables and potential misreporting.
Detailed information on the study ﬂow and recruitment process
is outlined in Fig. 1.
4.3. Interventions
A detailed description of the intervention processes has been
provided in previous studies (Nykänen et al., 2020). Due to space
limitations, we provide only a brief overview of the VR-based
safety training, lecture-based safety training, and HFST training
evaluated in this study.
4.3.1. VR-based safety training
The VR environment was developed using the Unity3D game
engine, C# programming language, and HTC Vive VR system. The
content of the VR-based safety training included: (1) Acknowledging the positive outcomes of using personal protective equipment;
(2) Identifying and preventing hazards in a work environment
(falling objects, slipping and tripping); (3) Hazard awareness
around trafﬁc on a construction site; (4) Inspecting equipment
and machinery for potential defects or hazards; and (5) Safety procedures for using a table saw or safety procedures for working at
height. To ensure that the content of the training was compatible
with the needs of the participating workplaces, we developed
two different versions of the training. The only difference between
the two versions was in their ﬁnal part (5). The ﬁrst version (implemented in four study organizations) focused on the safe use of a
table saw, and the other on safe working procedures at height (implemented in four study organizations). Nevertheless, both versions had equivalent training topics in terms of the ﬁnal part of
the training: inspecting equipment and identifying hazards in the
work environment. Appendix A shows illustrative picture of the
VR learning environment. Internal pilot testing of the VR-based

training was conducted from December 2018 to January 2019. A
total of 14 people from outside the research team tested the VR
learning environment. This was to ensure technical and pedagogical functionality of the training before the actual implementation.
The
VR
learning
activities
used
social
cognitive
theories
(Bandura, 1997) and the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen,
1991). For example, safety self-efﬁcacy was targeted by providing
mastery experiences of preventive actions and sharing positive
feedback (visual and auditory) on the safety-related actions performed by the study participants. Internal safety locus of control
was targeted by guiding study participants to identify the factors
preceding accidents and raising awareness of how an individual
worker’s preventive actions can prevent accidents. For example,
the study participants practiced preventative actions by marking
the factors contributing to tripping or slipping accidents. Outcome
expectancies were modiﬁed by providing study participants with
feedback on the relationship between safety-related actions and
accident prevention. The duration of the VR-based safety training
was approximately 25–30 min. The virtual environment was
developed so that it provided guidance for the study participants,
which meant that the research team members did not need to provide any additional guidance.
4.3.2. Lecture-based safety training
The lecture-based safety training was based on a trainercentered approach. The learning topics and the content of the
lecture-based training corresponded to the VR-based training sessions implemented in the study organization, and the distinguishing factor was the training method (VR vs. lecture). A safety
training expert who was not part of the research team delivered
the lecture-based safety training at each workplace separately.
The trainer was actively involved in lecturing, while the study participants were in a more passive learner role. The active participation of the study participants (e.g., engaging in discussions) during
the lectures was neither speciﬁcally prevented nor promoted. The
safety-related information was presented in a slide-show format in
which screenshots from the VR safety training were shown. In this
respect, our intervention process was similar to that in previous
study by Leder et al. (2019). Each lecture was attended by 3–9
study participants (M = 5.4 participants). Social cognitive theories

(Bandura, 1997) and the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991)
were considered when planning the lectures. A key mechanism for
enhancing self-efﬁcacy was verbal persuasion and encouraging the
participants to implement safety-related actions at their workplaces. Safety locus of control was targeted by sharing information
about the importance of individual workers’ preventive actions.
Outcome expectancies were modiﬁed by providing the study participants with information on the relationship between safetyrelated actions and accident prevention. The duration of the
lecture-based safety training was also approximately 25–30 min.
4.3.3. HFST training
The HFST training was tailored to meet the needs of the construction sector. Two professional safety trainers planned the
training session together and both used the predeﬁned protocol
in their training. The training process supported active participation on the part of study participants (e.g., reﬂection and dialogue,
short participatory group/pair discussions). The trainer guided the
study participants to identify the positive outcomes of acknowledging human factors in promoting safety and to identify how
human factors can contribute to safety. At the end of the training,
the participants analyzed a ﬁctive accident case and identiﬁed the
factors that either weakened or strengthened safety during the
accident. This participatory activity was a key mechanism for providing the trainees with mastery experiences. HFST training can
also be seen as complementary to lecture / VR training. HFST training provided an overview of the human factors and a broader perspective of the factors affecting safety and accidents. Case
examples were used, which were linked to the content of VR/lecture training. The total duration of the HFST training was approximately 90 min, including a 10 min break. Appendix B contains a
description of the educational topics of the HFST training.
4.4. Outcome measures
The outcome measures were included in the questionnaires at
all measurement points (baseline, short-term follow-up, onemonth follow-up). An exception was the self-reported safety performance measures, which were included at both baseline and
one-month follow-up.
4.4.1. Safety motivation
Safety motivation was measured using three 7-point items
(1 = Strongly disagree, 7 = Strongly agree) adapted from Neal,
Grifﬁn, and Hart (2000). Cronbach’s a was 0.66 at T1, a = 0.68 at
T2, and a = 0.65 at T3. An example item is: ‘‘I feel that it is worthwhile putting an effort into maintaining or improving my personal
safety.”
4.4.2. Safety locus of control
Four 7-point items (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = Strongly agree)
adapted from the study by Mazaheri Hidarnia and Ghofranipour
(2012) were used to measure safety locus of control. The scale
assessed beliefs regarding accident causation and had two subdimensions, each with two items. The ﬁrst dimension measured
the internal safety locus of control (e.g., people can avoid injury by
being careful and aware of potential dangers) and the second dimension measured the external safety locus of control (e.g., Whether
people get injured or not is a matter of fate, chance or luck). The
Spearman–Brown reliability estimate was 0.54 (item correlation
0.37, p < 0.00) for internal safety locus of control at T1, 0.44 (item
correlation 0.28, p < 0.00) at T2, and 0.73 (item correlation 0.56,
p < 0.00) at T3. The Spearman–Brown reliability estimate was
0.41 (item correlation 0.28, p < 0.00) for external safety locus of
control at T1, 0.62 (item correlation 0.45, p < 0.00) at T2, and
0.73 (item correlation 0.41, p < 0.00) at T3. This indicated that
the safety locus of control measure had low reliability. Therefore,
the respective analyses should be regarded as only indicative.
4.4.3. Perceived control over safety issues
We measured the perceived control over safety issues using two
7-point items (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = Strongly agree) (e.g. workers are able to make signiﬁcant contributions to the safety of the work
area) adapted from the study by Curcuruto et al. (2016). The reliability estimate was 0.76 (item correlation 0.61, p < 0.01) at T1, 0.86
(item correlation 0.76, p < 0.01) at T2, and 0.71 (item correlation
0.56, p < 0.01) at T3.
4.4.4. Safety knowledge
Our safety knowledge measure was a modiﬁed version of the
safety knowledge test used previously by Sacks, Perlman, and
Barak (2013). Our purpose was to measure whether study participants correctly identiﬁed hazards and safety procedures during a
work task (using a table saw or working at height). The study participants completed the safety knowledge measurement at baseline, immediately after the VR- or lecture-based training, and at
one-month follow-up. The safety knowledge measure included a
brief description of a work task with three open-ended questions:
(1) List the potential hazards related to a described work task; (2)
Describe how to ensure occupational safety at the beginning of the
work task; (3) List the safety procedures, appropriate safety equipment and safety instructions and actions that help prevent accidents during the work task.
The
data
preparation
for
the
safety
knowledge
measure
included the following steps: The research team prepared a comprehensive list of hazards and safety procedures related to the
open-ended questions. Second, the content validity of the list
was conﬁrmed by two independent safety training experts working in the construction sector. Third, the ﬁnal list was used as
frame to score the safety knowledge level of the study participants.
One research team member, blinded to the intervention arms,
scored open-ended questions by comparing the study participants’
responses to the comprehensive list of hazards and safety procedures. The participants received one point for each relevant hazard,
safety procedure, piece of safety equipment, and preventive action
mentioned. Finally, a safety knowledge sum score (0–24 points)
was calculated for each study participant. The research team member who scored the answers was not involved in the intervention
development, did not participate in the baseline or follow-up
assessments, and had no contact with the study participants or
workplaces.
4.4.5. Safety self-efﬁcacies and outcome expectancies
Two measures, safety self-efﬁcacies and safety-related outcome
expectancies were developed for this study. To establish the content validity of these measures, we used the following steps: (1)
The questionnaire items were developed by the research team;
(2) The construction sector workers (n = 3) reviewed the measures
and checked that the questionnaire items were meaningful to the
target group. These construction sector workers did not participate
in the study and did not work in the target organizations.
The
14-item
safety-related
outcome
expectancies
scale
assessed the perceived beneﬁts (1 = not at all useful 7 = extremely
useful) in terms of individual-level and organizational-level safetyrelated activities. The 10-item safety self-efﬁcacy scale assessed
the study participants’ conﬁdence (1 = very poorly 7 = very well)
in various safety-related activities, including work task-speciﬁc
safety performance and more general safety behaviors (e.g., identifying hazards).
According to Bandura (2012), self-efﬁcacy is a multidimensional
construct and self-efﬁcacy scales should be linked to relevant
activity domains. Previous studies have also utilized multidimenM. Nykänen, V. Puro, M. Tiikkaja et al.

sional outcome expectancy measures (e.g. Wójcicki, White, and
Mc Auley, 2009). Thus, we treated both safety-related outcome
expectancies and safety self-efﬁcacy measures as multidimensional constructs.
The safety self-efﬁcacy measures included the following subdimensions: (1) three items assessed self-efﬁcacy to identify the factors affecting safety (example item: ‘‘Identify the issues affecting the
occurrence of accidents,” a = 0.86 at T1, a = 0.80 at T2, a = 0.85 at
T3); (2) four items assessed self-efﬁcacy related to preventive
actions
(example
item:
‘‘Use
personal
protective
equipment,”
a = 0.73 at T1, a = 0.64 at T2, a = 0.77 at T3); and (3) three items
assessed work task-speciﬁc safety self-efﬁcacy (example item:
‘‘Carry out safety inspections of table saw,” a = 0.85 at T1, a 0.89 at
T2, a 0.90 at T3).
The safety-related outcome expectancy measure included the
following sub-dimensions: (1) six items measured the workerlevel performance outcome value (example item: ‘‘Worker compliance with safety instructions,” a = 0.89 at T1, a = 0.89 at T2, a = 0.90
at T3); (2) four items measured the organizational level practices
outcome value (example item: ‘‘Increasing the amount of safety
training at the workplace,” a = 0.82 at T1, a = 0.80 at T2, a = 0.82
at T3); and (3) four items assessed the general safety performance
outcome value (example item ‘‘Ensuring cleanliness and tidiness at
the workplace,” a = 0.82 at T1, a = 0.80 at T2, a = 0.82 at T3). A
detailed description of the questionnaire items and the psychometric properties of the outcome expectancy and safety measures are
presented in the Supplementary material.
4.4.6. Safety performance
We assessed safety performance using a self-report approach.
We adapted a scale previously used by Neal, Grifﬁn, and Hart
(2000): A four-item seven-point scale (1 = strongly disagree,
7 = Strongly agree) which included two subdimensions: (1) safety
compliance (‘‘I use the correct safety procedures to do my job,” ‘‘I
use all the necessary safety equipment to do my job”); and (2) safety
participation (‘‘I voluntarily perform tasks or activities that help
improve workplace safety,” ‘‘I put in extra effort to improve the safety
of the workplace”). The Spearman–Brown reliability estimate was
0.79 (item correlation 0.65, p < 0.00) for safety compliance at T1,
and 0.71 (item correlation 0.55, p < 0.00) at T3. The reliability estimate was 0.70 (item correlation 0.54, p < 0.00) for safety participation at T1, and 0.73 (item correlation 0.57, p < 0.00) at T3.
4.5. Intervention measures
The intervention condition variable was coded with a value of 1
for study participants who took part in the VR-based safety training and 0 for study participants who took part in lecture-based
safety training. In the analyses, which evaluated the effects of HFST
training, the intervention condition variable was coded with a
value of 1 for study participants who took part in the HFST training
and 0 for study participants who had no HFST training.
4.6. Implementation process measures
We utilized observational data, data recorded during activities
in the VR environment, and study participants’ self-reports of
learning experiences to evaluate various aspects of the intervention processes.
4.6.1. Recorded VR data
We recorded the research participants’ movements in a VR
learning environment to gain insights into the level of activity of
the study participants during the training. Speciﬁcally, we used
the 3D position and rotation data of the VR headset. Data processing used Python programming. In VR, the user views the virtual
world through two separate cameras (one for each eye) so the best
approximation for the position of the user was the midpoint of
these two cameras, which we used to gather the position data.
Thus when we refer to user movement, we speciﬁcally mean the
movement of the user’s head. Using this location information, we
produced an illustration of how users navigate through the VR
environment during a safety training session.
4.6.2. Sense of presence
We measured the sense of presence as an indicator of participant responsiveness to VR-based safety training. We used a
seven-point measure adapted from previous studies by Schubert,
Friedmann, and Regenbrecht (2001) and Witmer, Jerome, and
Singer (2005). Our measure included four sub-dimensions, with
higher scores indicating greater sense of presence: (1) Spatial presence included three items (e.g. ‘‘I felt present in the virtual space,”
1 = strongly agree 7 = strongly disagree) with a = 0.91; (2) The
involvement sub-dimension was reduced from three to two items
because one reverse-coded item (‘‘How aware were you of the real
world surrounding you?”) did not correlate with the other items.
Thus, the involvement sub-dimension used in the study contained
two items (e.g. ‘‘How much did the virtual environment involve you?”
1 = not at all 7 = very much) with a Spearman–Brown coefﬁcient of
0.63 and item correlations of 0.46 (p < 0.01). 3) Judgements of realness included three items (e.g. ‘‘How real did the virtual world seem
to you?” 1 = not at all 7 = very much) with a = 0.82 and 4) Feelings
of control included four items (e.g. ‘‘How much were you able to
control events in the virtual environment?” 1 = not at all 7 = very
well) with a = 0.64.
4.6.3. Simulator sickness symptoms
In our study, we used a 16-item measure by Kennedy et al.
(1993) to measure simulator sickness symptoms immediately after
the VR-based training. Each item reﬂected simulator sickness
symptoms (e.g., blurred vision, dizziness, increased salivation)
and was rated by the participants as ‘‘0 = none,” ‘‘1 = slight,”
‘‘2 = moderate,” or ‘‘3 = severe.” Thus, the simulator sickness measure score could range from 0 to 48. In our study, Cronbach’s a
for simulator sickness measures was 0.58.
4.6.4. Perceived utility and satisfaction
Satisfaction with the training and perceived utility were
assessed at short-term follow-up (after VR-based safety training
and lecture-based safety training) using thirteen 7-point items.
Six items measured whether the study participants perceived that
the training had enhanced their safety-related skills and abilities
(1 = not at all, 7 = very much). Seven items measured the participants’ general satisfaction with the training. Satisfaction with the
training and perceived utility was also assessed at one-month follow up among those who participated in the HFST training. Two 7point questionnaire items assessed the perceived beneﬁts of HFST
training, and two 7-point items measured general satisfaction with
the training. A detailed description of the perceived utility and satisfaction items is provided in Table 5 and in the Results section.
4.6.5. Observational data
To further document the intervention delivery, we used a structured checklist during the VR-based safety training, lecture-based
safety training, and HFST training. Observational data were collected by a research team member and were based on direct observation of the training sessions. In the VR-based safety training,
observational coding was targeted toward the following factors:
(1) The amount of study participant guidance during the VR activities, (2) adjustments of the VR headset during training, and (3)
Technical issues during training. In the lecture-based safety training and HFST training, observation gathered information on (1)

### Page 8

whether participants contributed their own information to the discussions, (2) the level of discussion between the study participants,
and (3) the number of comments the participants made during the
training. The observational data from each session was entered
into a spreadsheet and scored quantitatively from 1 (not at all)
to 5 (very much).
4.6.6. Interview data
After the one-month follow-up, short telephone interviews
were conducted to gather feedback on the training sessions. The
study participants were given the opportunity to share their experiences of the training in their own words. The interviews lasted
approximately ﬁve minutes each and were voice recorded. The
interview data were processed as follows. First, the data were
divided into different categories based on which safety training
method they referred to (VR, lecture or HFST). Next, distinct anecdotes or stated opinions about learning experiences were identiﬁed and categorized. The emerging categories were discussed,
agreed on, and determined by ﬁve research team members. These
categories were further classiﬁed as positive or negative feedback.
Once the ﬁnal code list was agreed upon, one of the coders coded
the transcripts. At this point, the frequencies of the negative and
positive feedback were calculated to obtain an idea of their prevalence in the data. Thus we calculated the percentage of the participants who provided positive and negative feedback on each safety
training method.
4.7. Statistical methods
4.7.1. Descriptive statistics and process analysis
The frequencies, correlations, and means of the study variables
were calculated to provide information on the study participants,
descriptive statistics, and implementation process-related factors.
Baseline differences were tested using independent samples ttests and chi-square tests according to the scale of the variable.
Outlier detection was performed using visual inspection of data
and by identifying three or more standard deviations from the
mean in all the outcome variables (Osborne & Overbay, 2004).
Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcient was calculated to determine the internal consistency of the scales with three or more items. The Spearman–Brown reliability estimate and
the Pearson correlation
coefﬁcient were calculated using two-item scales (see Eisenga,
Grotenhuis, & Pelzer, 2013).
4.7.2. Outcome analyses
As the study participants were nested in different organizations,
the individuals’ responses were potentially inﬂuenced by their
workplaces. Furthermore, outcome measures were collected over
time, producing a design in which measurement sessions were
nested within individuals. In our study, we used generalized linear
mixed modeling (GLMM) to evaluate safety training outcomes.
Time was modelled as a repeated variable and an unstructured
covariance structure was used to accommodate dependencies
between different points of time. All analyses were adjusted for
age and organization-level random intercepts were included in
all the models to account for nesting.
Our primary study hypotheses focused on the differential
changes in the VR-based safety training participants and the
lecture-based safety training participants over short-term followup and one-month follow-up. Time was treated as a variable with
two levels (baseline and follow-up) and the intervention condition
as having two levels (VR-based safety training, lecture-based safety
training). Our secondary research questions focused on the differential changes in the HFST training condition participants and
the study participants without HFST training between the shortterm follow-up and the one-month follow-up. In these analyses,
the intervention condition was treated as having two levels (HFST
training, no HFST training). For all outcome analyses, the intervention effect of interest was the interaction between intervention
condition and time.
Signiﬁcance levels were set at p < 0.05 and Satterthwaite smallsample correction was used. The normality of the residuals in all
the study models were conﬁrmed before analyses. We calculated
Cohen’s d effect sizes using the method described by Morris
(2008). Effect sizes for between-group differences were interpreted
based on Cohen’s (1988) guidelines, with 0.20 indicating a small
effect, 0.50 indicating a medium effect, and 0.80 indicating a large
effect. Following the intention-to-treat principle, the study participants were analyzed according to the intervention condition to
which they were randomly assigned, regardless of whether they
attended the training.
5. Results
5.1. Descriptive statistics
Table 1 describes the study participant characteristics across
the intervention conditions. The mean age of the study participants
was 41.2 years, and the sample was 96.6% male. The study participants randomly allocated into the VR-based safety training or
lecture-based safety training did not differ in terms of their background variables. In addition, we detected no statistically signiﬁcant baseline differences between study participants randomized
into the HFST training and those randomized into the comparison
group without HFST training.
Furthermore, we found no statistically signiﬁcant baseline differences between intervention conditions (VR-based vs. lecturebased) in terms of study outcomes and we detected no statistically
signiﬁcant differences at short-term follow-up between the study
participants further allocated to HFST training and those without
HFST training. Tables 2 and 3 provide an overview of the mean
scores of the study participants’ outcome variables at baseline,
short-term follow-up, and one-month follow-up. The intercorrelations of the study variables are provided in the Supplementary
material.
5.2. Short-term effect of virtual reality-based safety training
Next, we present the analyses in terms of the short-term effects
of the VR-based safety training. The ﬁrst set of GLMM models
included only the time variable (assessment time points: baseline,
short-term follow-up) as a ﬁxed effect. These models were
designed to assess the impact of time in general, for the entire
study sample. We found that all the study outcomes, except external safety locus of control and perceived control over safety issues,
increased signiﬁcantly from baseline to short-term follow-up, as
indicated by the models in which only time was a predictor.
Next, to explore the different time trends at short-term followup between the intervention conditions, we added an interaction
term between the intervention condition and the time variable in
the models. These models included the time variable (baseline,
short-term follow-up), the intervention condition (0 = lecturebased safety training, 1 = VR-based safety training), the interaction
of the intervention condition and time, and age as ﬁxed effects. We
hypothesized that VR-based safety training would have a stronger
impact on study outcomes at short-term follow-up. This assumption was partly supported. Our analyses showed a statistically signiﬁcant interaction between time and the intervention condition in
ﬁve outcomes: Compared to the lecture-based safety training, the
study participants in the VR-based safety training showed a greater
increase in self-efﬁcacy in identifying factors affecting safety (estiM. Nykänen, V. Puro, M. Tiikkaja et al.

mate 0.25, p < 0.05), internal safety locus of control (estimate 0.25,
p < 0.00), safety motivation (estimate 0.09, p < 0.05), worker-level
performance outcome value (estimate 0.10, p < 0.05), and safety
knowledge (estimate 1.35, p < 0.05). Cohen’s d effect sizes were
0.47 for self-efﬁcacy in identifying factors affecting safety, 0.37
for internal safety locus of control, 0.20 for safety motivation,
0.32 for safety knowledge, and 0.25 for worker-level performance
outcome value. Thus, the relative advantage of the VR-based safety
training compared to the lecture-based safety training was small to
moderate at short-term follow-up. Table 4 presents the results of
the models exploring the safety training method by time interactions at short-term follow-up.

5.3. Long-term effect of virtual reality-based safety training
Next, we explored the effect of time on outcome variables at
one-month follow-up. These models included only the time variable (baseline, one-month follow-up) as a ﬁxed effect. The purpose
was to assess the long-term impact of participating in the study in
general, for the entire study sample. We found that six study outcomes increased signiﬁcantly from baseline to one-month followup in the study sample.
In the following analyses, we evaluated the differential changes
between the study participants in the VR-based safety training and
those in the lecture-based safety training over the one-month
follow-up. These models included the time variable (baseline,
one-month follow-up), the intervention condition (1 = VR-based
training 0 = Lecture-based training), the interaction of the intervention condition and time, and age as ﬁxed effects. We found a
statistically signiﬁcant interaction between the intervention condition and time in two outcomes: Compared to the lecture-based
safety training, the VR-based safety training participants showed
a greater increase in self-efﬁcacy in identifying factors affecting
safety (estimate 0.38, p < 0.00). The VR-based safety training participants also showed a greater increase in self-reported safety performance (estimate 0.46, p < 0.00). This means that they reported a
higher rate of performing voluntary activities that help improve
workplace safety and put extra effort into improving workplace
safety. Cohen’s d effect sizes at long-term follow-up were 0.61
for self-efﬁcacy in identifying factors affecting safety, and 0.42
for safety participation, which indicated a small to moderate relative advantage for VR-based safety training. Table 5 presents the
results of the models exploring the interaction between the safety
training method and time at one-month follow-up.
5.4. HFST training effects
Approximately half of the study participants were further randomized to participate in HFST training after the short-term
follow-up (T2). Our ﬁnal set of outcome analyses focused on comparing changes in terms of self-efﬁcacies and outcome expectancies from short-term follow-up to one-month follow-up in two
conditions: the HFST training condition and the control condition
without HFST training. We evaluated the HFST training effect using
models that included the time variable (short-term follow-up and
long-term follow-up), the HFST training variable (0 = no HFST
training 1 = HFST training), and age as ﬁxed effects. Table 6 presents the results of statistical models exploring the effects of HFST
training. Contrary to our study hypotheses, there were no signiﬁcant differences between the increase of safety self-efﬁcacies or
outcome expectancies of the study participants in the HFST training condition and those in the control condition without HFST
training. This indicated that participating in HFST training had no
impact on the measured outcomes.

5.5. Process evaluation
5.5.1. Process analysis of VR-based and lecture-based safety training
The aim of the process evaluation was to evaluate whether
intervention processes were delivered as intended and to assess
study participant responsiveness. First, we explored whether the
learning experiences of the lecture-based and VR-based safety
training differed. The results of the independent samples t-tests
showed signiﬁcant differences between VR-based safety training
and lecture-based safety training. The VR-based safety training
participants reported a statistically signiﬁcantly (p < 0.01) higher
perceived utility and satisfaction levels than the lecture-based
safety training participants. The results of the perceived utility
and satisfaction questions are presented in Table 7. The highest
mean difference between the perceived utility of the lecturebased and VR-based safety training was associated with identifying
factors that may cause danger at the workplace (4.79 vs. 3.41) and
with abilities to make safety-related observations (5.00 vs. 3.69).
This supported our efﬁcacy results, suggesting that the VR-based
training had a greater impact on self-efﬁcacy in identifying factors
affecting safety. The highest mean difference in terms of satisfaction was detected in relation to how inspiring the safety training
was perceived as being (5.94 vs. 3.91). This supported our ﬁnding
that the VR-based training had a stronger impact on safety
motivation.
We examined the sense of presence scores to determine the
level of participant responsiveness in terms of psychological
engagement. The study participants rated their learning experiences according to four sub-dimensions of sense of presence: (1)
spatial
presence
(mean = 6.03
SD = 0.9);
(2)
controllability
(mean = 5.85 SD = 0.62); (3) involvement (mean = 5.47 SD = 1.04);
and (4) realism (mean = 5.31 SD = 0.96). Considering the response
scale was from 1 to 7, these results indicated relatively high levels
of sense of presence.
The reported simulator sickness mean score was 2.77 (range
from 0.00 to 32.0, SD = 3.49), which is a similar result to previous
studies that have evaluated simulator sickness symptoms related
to VR experiences (e.g., Merta & Kelling, 2015). Thus, the results
did not indicate that the VR experience had strong adverse effects
on the study participants. Recorded data of the research participants’ movements in a VR learning environment illustrated that
study participants were exploring the VR environment as part of
their learning. Case example of study participants movements during training is presented in Appendix A.
Of the employees who participated in the VR-based training and
responded to telephone interviews (n = 36), 81% gave positive

feedback on the training. In this feedback, training was seen as
having increased in-depth thinking about occupational safety.
The participatory approach was also considered good and the
training was perceived as interesting. The interviews revealed that
after the training, overall cleanliness had improved and work
machinery inspections had increased in many study organizations.
The employees claimed it was good that during the training they
had had to think about and carry out the safety-related tasks themselves. Nineteen percent of those interviewed also gave negative
feedback. The negative issues mentioned were mostly related to
the technical problems in implementing the training.
The results (presented in Table 8) of the observational data
showed that 40.4% of the study participants had minor technical
problems during the VR-based safety training. The majority (41%)
of the observed technical issues were related to minor positional
tracking issues with the motion controllers when they froze or
began to drift away from their actual position in the real world.
These were nevertheless ﬁxed quickly. Furthermore, 14% of the
observed technical issues were related to minor difﬁculties with
performing the hand waving motion in the virtual environment
in a way that the computer would recognize. Seven study participants stepped out of the play area during their VR-based training
session. In these cases, a research team member redirected the person back to the play area. Other technical issues were related to
minor software- or audio-related issues in the initial phase of the
training. In all cases, the duration of the technical issues was short.
An exception was the ﬁrst two VR-based training sessions in the
study, which had to be canceled in the ﬁrst minutes. The research
team scheduled new VR-based training times for these two study
participants. Observational data also showed that the VR learning
environment worked quite independently and that the research
team did not need to give the research participants much additional guidance. Results of VR-based safety training observations
are presented in Table 8.
Using t-tests, we compared the perceived utility, general satisfaction, and sense of presence scores of the study participants with
technical difﬁculties (n = 28) during the VR-based safety training
and those of the study participants without technical difﬁculties
(n = 26). We found no statistically signiﬁcant differences in any
of the sense of presence subscales. However, our analysis revealed
that the study participants with technical difﬁculties had higher
ratings (2.07 vs. 1.11, p < 0.05) on items reﬂecting dissatisfaction
with the training method (‘‘the training method hindered my ability
to focus”), indicating that the technical issues during the VR-based
safety training had an impact on the learning experience. Overall,
the process analysis results showed that the program was delivered as intended in terms of minimal risk of simulator sickness
and immersive VR learning experience.
Our observational data also conﬁrmed that the lecture-based
safety training used a trainer-centered approach. The level of discussion between the study participants was low in the lecturebased safety training sessions (88.9% no discussion during training,
11.1% some discussion). The study participants themselves did not
share much safety knowledge during the lectures (77.8% none,
22.2% some safety knowledge sharing). The overall amount of comments made by the study participants was also low during the lectures (55.6% none, 44.4% some comments during training). Of the
employees who participated in the lectures and responded to the
telephone interviews (n = 47), 51% gave positive feedback on the
training. According to the feedback, the training provided an
opportunity to rehearse safety-related topics. Furthermore, 56%
also expressed negative feedback, according to which the lecture
contained no new information. Sitting while training was also
mentioned as a negative factor. The usual work tasks of construcTable 7

which was considered tiring.
5.5.2. Process analysis of HFST training
HFST training participants evaluated the extent (1 = not at all,
7 = very much) to which the training had increased their knowledge regarding factors affecting the occurrence of accidents
(M = 5.44, SD = 1.20, min = 3 max = 7) and to which the training
had increased their safety knowledge (M = 4.67, SD = 1.7, min = 2
max = 7). The study participants also rated the extent to which
the contents of the HFST training were difﬁcult to understand
(M = 2.40, SD = 1.38, min = 1, max = 7) and the extent to which
using the HFST viewpoint was easy (M = 5.06, SD = 1.17, min = 1
max = 7). In general, these results indicated that study participants
perceived HFST training positively. We found that the engagement
of study participants in HFST training activities was higher than
that of those in the lecture-based safety training. However, the
level of discussion between the study participants during the HFST
training varied across the study organizations (11.1% no discussion
during training, 33.1% some discussion, 11.1% a moderate amount
of discussion, 33.3% quite a lot of discussion, 11.1% a great deal of
discussion). Safety knowledge sharing activity varied among the
study participants during the HFST training (22.2% none, 44.4%
some safety knowledge sharing, 11.1% a moderate amount of
knowledge sharing, 22.2% quite a lot of knowledge sharing). Similarly, the amount of comments made by the study participants varied across the HFST training (44.4% some comments, 11.1% a
moderate amount of comments during training, 33.3% quite a lot
of comments during training, 11.1% a great deal of comments during training). Of the employees who participated in the HFST training and also responded to the telephone interviews (n = 47), 82%
gave positive feedback on the training. According to the employees,
the training led to a more in-depth consideration of the issues
affecting occupational safety and the underlying causes of accidents. Sixteen percent of the participants also gave negative feedback about the training, mainly related to the fact that some felt it
did not give them any new knowledge.
6. Discussion
The process analysis results showed that all the intervention
processes were mostly delivered as intended. There were minor
technical discrepancies in the VR-based safety training and some
variation in terms of active participation during the HFST training.
The efﬁcacy evaluation showed that the VR-based safety training
was more effective than the lecture-based safety training, especially in enhancing safety self-efﬁcacy in identifying factors affecting safety. This result is somewhat similar to the results of previous
research showing that VR-based training strengthens hazard
recognition skills in particular (Perlman, Sacks, & Barak, 2014).
According to Bandura (1997), mastery experience is the most
important source of self-efﬁcacy. In our study, verbal persuasion
was
the
key
mechanism
for
enhancing
self-efﬁcacy
in
the
lecture-based safety training, while the VR-based safety training
also provided mastery experiences of safety-related actions during
the tasks in the virtual environment. Therefore, the VR-based training offered a more effective method for boosting safety selfefﬁcacy. Our results also indicated that the VR-based safety training’s effects on self-efﬁcacy in identifying factors affecting safety
were
sustained
in
the
one-month
follow-up
measurements.
According to our results, the VR-based safety training had a stronger impact on outcome expectancies related to worker-level safety
performance at short-term follow-up. Outcome expectancies were
targeted in the lecture-based safety training by providing information about the relationship between safety-related actions and
accident prevention. In the VR-based training, the study participants also removed hazards in a virtual environment. Thus, informational inﬂuence was supplemented by actual observation of
the effects of one’s own actions. More generally, the participants
perceived VR-based training as more inspiring, which supported
our ﬁnding that VR-based training had a stronger impact on safety
motivation.
We also evaluated the efﬁcacy of a participatory HFST training
program. Contrary to our hypothesis, no positive effects emerged
in comparison to the control group without HFST training. Several
factors may have contributed to this result. First, due to our limited
sample size, our analyses may have been underpowered for detection of a smaller intervention impact. Furthermore, observational
data indicated that the level of participants’ activity (engagement)
varied across the study organizations, which may have affected to
the results concerning efﬁcacy of HFST training. Previously, Teperi
and colleagues (2015) found positive effects of human factors
training, however, they implemented human factors safety training on both managerial and employee levels. In our study, training
targeted only the worker level. This in turn may have led to the
participants feeling powerless or sidelined, with no support or sufﬁcient understanding from supervisory and managerial levels.
Moreover, in the previous studies (Teperi et al., 2015, 2018), the
human factor safety training was more extensive than that in our
study and included substantially longer training sessions and
workshops lasting from one to several days, whereas in our study,
the HFST training lasted only around 1.5 h. Therefore, it is possible
that a more extensive HFST training would be needed in order to
identify effects on the measures used in this study. Although we
could not identify any statistically signiﬁcant differences between
the increase of safety self-efﬁcacies or outcome expectancies of the
study participants with HFST training and the control group without HFST training, the qualitative data do indicate some positive
effects. Speciﬁcally, the study participants perceived that HFST
training increased in-depth consideration of the issues affecting
occupational safety and the underlying causes of accidents. However, we did not measure these perceptions in our outcome measures, and this should be examined in future studies.
7. Study limitations
Our study has a few limitations. Due to the low reliability of the
measure of internal safety locus of control, the effects can be considered only indicative. It is also important to acknowledge that
the majority of the detected effect sizes were small – a likely reason being the relatively high baseline levels of participants’ safety
competencies. Nevertheless, even small intervention effects can
translate into substantial safety outcomes. This is illustrated by
our interview data, which provided examples of workplace activities after the training.
We also wish to underline that the lecture-based safety training
in our study was implemented using a trainer-centered approach.
This should be considered when interpreting the results. However,
this is an informative point of reference, because safety training in
the workplace is often based on a passive approach (see Burke
et al., 2006). Furthermore, self-reported safety performance measures should be interpreted as indicative and not deﬁnitive evidence of behavioral outcomes. Finally, our sample size was
rather small, which was also reﬂected in the conﬁdence intervals
of the results.
8. Study strengths
To our knowledge, this is one of the few RCTs to investigate the
impact of VR-based safety training and was the ﬁrst study to

explore the efﬁcacy of HFST training in the construction sector. We
also complemented the efﬁcacy assessment of intervention processes with process analysis, which is considered important in
safety intervention studies. Process analysis provides valuable
information for both practical training planning and new research
topics.
9. Practical implications
Our study showed that virtual reality is a potential tool in safety
training for increasing safety competencies and fostering motivational change in terms of the safety performance of construction
sector workers. To avoid any misinterpretation, we do not propose
that virtual reality could completely replace other safety training
methods (e.g., hands-on-training, safety discussions). Our study
indicates that VR provides a promising alternative to passive learning methods. VR safety training provides opportunities for active
learning and its motivating effect complements more traditional
training activities (e.g., lectures). Our process analysis revealed that
even small technical issues (e.g., positional tracking issues) may
inﬂuence the learning experiences and outcomes related to VRbased training. We had direct control over our ﬁrst-party developed software solution (the VR platform software and the created
VR content running on it), and there were no apparent software
bugs in the developed platform or the training content during
the intervention. No software solution could have resolved the
technical issues that arose concerning the hardware, which was
provided by a third party. This covers both the VR headset and
the computer communicating with it, and the interplay between
the VR headset and a computer can be prone to incompatibility
issues due to their different providers. However, this highlights
the importance of pilot studies and pre-testing technology-based
safety training methods before proceeding to RCTs.
Producing immersive VR environments can be time consuming
and requires both technical and substance-driven competence for
providing a successful learning experience. The production of VR
content can be facilitated with a proper content creation pipeline,
and a dedicated software framework. This study utilized a dedicated, domain-speciﬁc approach that was ﬁrst created and then
used to model and implement all the training scenarios for the project (Nykänen et al., 2020). Having similar tools at hand can support dissemination and implementation of VR-safety training
methods at workplaces.
Our qualitative data indicates that HFST training may have positive effects on safety perceptions. In the future, HFST training
should be implemented on both managerial and employee levels
in order to enable a shared understanding of human factors affecting safety throughout the organization. Furthermore, HFST training
should be given more time to provide ample space for discussions
and practice, hence enhancing the learning results.
10. Future studies
Many important aspects of the present study need further
research: First, using larger sample sizes, future studies should
compare the outcomes of immersive VR-based safety training
and more participatory face-to-face safety training. Previous studies have also pointed out that implementation process factors are
potential moderators of intervention outcomes (see Carroll et al.,
2007). The overall effectiveness of virtual environments may be
dependent on a multitude of factors such as gamiﬁcation, usability,
and virtual environment design. The success of the resulting VR
training thus depends on more factors than merely the immersive
capabilities provided by the hardware used. The immersive capabilities supported by the technology can easily be exploited for
ill-ﬁtting user experience, if used without taking the user experience and engagement into account. For creating a virtual reality
training environment suitable for engaging self-guided learning,
all the contributing factors present in interactive content such as
VR should be considered. Future studies should explore the associations between key characteristics of the virtual learning experience (e.g., sense of presence and usability). This can provide
insight over how an effective VR training should fundamentally
be built and to what extent should immersion be depended on
for explaining these achieved results. Studying these aspects could
increase understanding of the key ‘‘active ingredients” of VR-based
safety training (see Abry, Hulleman, & Rimm-Kaufman, 2015). Furthermore, due to our limited study sample, it was not possible to
further test the moderating role of technical issues during the
VR-based safety training and intervention outcomes. Future studies should assess the impact of possible technical issues on learning outcomes.
Future studies should also explore the role of trainees’ activity
levels in HFST training outcomes and evaluate the effects of HFST
training on trainees’ perceptions of the causal explanations and
attributions of workplace accidents. Furthermore, it would be
important to understand how the broader safety knowledge provided by the HFST training can be transformed to better safety
practices on individual, team, and organizational levels.

Senior
Specialist, Ph D
student)
is actively
involved in psychophysical research, VR development, and product development
at the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health. His research interests include
methods for measuring psychophysiological status, and the more cognitive
aspects of work.
Appendix A
The ﬁgure in Appendix A provides an illustrative example of
active learning activities during a VR-training. The example
describes a sample walking path in one scene of one of the trainings. The user started this training scene in the square labeled
‘‘Start” and ended in the diamond labeled ‘‘End”. The user’s movement path between these points has been simpliﬁed using the
Ramer–Douglas–Peucker
algorithm
(Ramer,
1972;
Douglas
&
Peucker, 1973) into several movement segments illustrated with
arrows to preserve directional information, however, the length
of the arrow does not imply faster movement speed. Gray circles
labeled ‘‘Idle #1” through ‘‘Idle #4” show the locations in the scene
where the user was mostly still, how many seconds the user was
still for, and the order in which these events took place. White
frames labeled ‘‘Observation A.” through ‘‘Observation E.” surround
all interactive parts of the scene that have educational information
attached. When activating one of these observations the educational information is displayed in a text box near the object.
