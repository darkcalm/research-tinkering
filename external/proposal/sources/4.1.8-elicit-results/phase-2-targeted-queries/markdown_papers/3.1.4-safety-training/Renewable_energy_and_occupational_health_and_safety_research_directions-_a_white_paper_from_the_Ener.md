Renewable energy production may offer advantages to human health by way of less
pollution and fewer climate-change associated ill-health effects. Limited data suggests
that renewable energy will also offer beneﬁts to workers in the form of reduced occupational injury, illness and deaths. However, studies of worker safety and health in the
industry are limited. The Mountain and Plains Education and Research Center (MAP
ERC) Energy Summit held in April 2011 explored issues concerning worker health
and safety in the renewable energy industry. The limited information on hazards of
working in the renewable energy industry emphasizes the need for further research.
Two basic approaches to guiding both prevention and future research should include:
(1) applying lessons learned from other ﬁelds of occupational safety and health, particularly the extractive energy industry; and (2) utilizing knowledge of occupational
hazards of speciﬁc materials and processes used in the renewable energy industry.

INTRODUCTION
Renewable energies, deﬁned as ‘‘fuel sources that restore themselves over short periods of time and do not
diminish’’ [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011]
are expanding as a share of total United States energy
consumption. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, renewable technologies including wind, solar, biomass,
biofuels, and hydropower currently provide more than
10% of total U.S. energy generation [U.S. Department of
Energy, 2010].
Wind and solar energy production have experienced a
recent rapid increase owing to a reduction in technology
costs along with marked increases in capital investment.
From 2000 to 2009, installed electric capacity for wind and
solar energy increased at a compounded annual growth rate
of 33.7% and 39.3%, respectively [U.S. Department of
Energy,
2010].
Biofuel
development,
with
continued
strong U.S. government subsidy support, has also experienced rapid growth. Between 2000 and 2009, corn ethanol
production increased approximately sixfold, and biodiesel
production increased 100-fold [U.S. Department of Energy,
2010]. Hydropower, which currently accounts for the largest share of U.S. renewable energy and nearly 7% of
total U.S. electrical energy generation, has experienced
stagnant growth in the recent past, but is now being reconsidered for expansion and development at several sites, given pressing national energy needs [Smith, 2011].
Given that more than half of all new U.S. electrical
capacity installations each year are from a renewable
source [U.S. Department of Energy, 2010], there is an accompanying major shift underway in energy industry employment. Currently, best estimates suggest there are
approximately 15,000 individuals employed in the solarphotovoltaic and solar-thermal industries [U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2011], 75,000 in the wind energy industry [American Wind Energy Association, 2010],
and at least 200,000 in the hydropower industry [National
Hydropower Association, 2011]. Not only is renewable
energy production believed to offer signiﬁcant advantages
to human health relative to standard fossil fuel energy
production
by
way
of
less
pollution
and
climatechange associated ill-health effects, but the limited data
currently available suggests that renewable energy will
also offer beneﬁts to workers in the form of reduced occupational injury, illness, and death [Sumner and Layde,
2009].
Nonetheless, signiﬁcant research and policy considerations are needed to assure improved occupational health
and safety (OHS) in the energy industry. With the pending
transition from an extractive fossil fuel economy to a renewable energy economy, there is an opportunity to reconﬁgure the approach to promoting OSH for an industry that
has been among the most dangerous [CDCC, 2008].
The Mountain and Plains Education and Research
Center (MAP ERC), one of 18 Education and Research
Centers funded by the Centers for Disease Control/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (CDC/
NIOSH), provides occupational health and safety education and conducts research for Colorado, New Mexico,
Arizona, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, and South
Dakota. In April 2011, the MAP ERC held the ﬁrst annual
Energy Summit in Denver, Colorado to explore issues concerning
worker
health
and
safety
in
the
renewable
energy industry. The conference aim was to share lessons
learned, identify gaps in OSH research and policy, and articulate a general framework for assuring optimal occupational health and safety practices in the renewable energy
industries. Leading researchers in the ﬁeld of occupational
health and safety in the energy industries were invited to
present papers at the conference. Following the conference
a working group of these researchers was convened. Each
energy sector author reviewed the papers presented at the
conference, conducted a literature search, and drafted a
summary for inclusion in this overview. The paper represents a consensus of the papers presented at the conference
and each energy sector author. A limitation is that the paper
may not represent all views in the research community and
not all aspects of each sector were presented, that is, nuclear energy industry power plants.
There are many potential types of renewable energy
concepts and technologies being considered; the Energy
Summit focused on the major areas of wind, solar, biomass/biofuels, and hydropower, given their importance
and/or potential for growth in the renewable energy market. Wind, solar and hydropower are primarily used for
electrical energy production whereas biomass converted
into biofuels can take the place of conventional fuels like
gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel.
EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES: LESSONS
LEARNED
Extractive industries for the production of fossil fuels
(coal, oil, and gas) and uranium have been at the center of
United States energy policies for decades. The abundance
of domestic fossil fuel and uranium reserves enabled unprecedented technological and economic growth since the
industrial revolution; but this growth has come with human and environmental costs. These costs, though well
known, are not often considered as part of the U.S. energy
policy. Lessons learned from the extractive industries in
terms of worker health and safety are applicable to the
newer technologies of renewable energy industries.
Coal has been the center of the U.S. energy industry,
ﬁrst for heat and now as a major source of electricity production. Currently, coal accounts for one-third of U.S. energy production and just over half of the electricity

produced [National Academies Press, 2010], with substantial and politically important geographic variation in terms
of air pollution and air quality as well as in workforce and
economic impact. Historically, improvements in coal mine
health and safety have arisen in response to major disasters in the industry, including recent disasters at Upper
Big Branch and Sago mines in West Virginia and Crandall
Canyon mine in Utah. Since 1900, there has been a steady
decline in work-related mortality in coal miners [CDCC,
1999] following regulatory interventions in response to
disasters along with increased mechanization and the shift
from underground to surface operations.
Compared to fatalities, chronic health effects due to
coal mining have not shown the same sustained decline.
The prevalence of coal workers pneumoconiosis (CWP)
declined from 20%, 25%, and 35% in the early 1970s in
active coal miners with 20–24, 25–29, and over 30 years
of underground mining respectively to approximately 3%,
3%, and 7% in the late 1990s. However, the prevalence of
CWP in those groups of coal miners increased to 6%, 8%,
and nearly 10% in the mid-2000s, suggesting problems
with adequacy of the current coal mine dust permissible
exposure limit (PEL) of 2 mg/m3 in protecting the lungs
of US coal miners and/or problems with its enforcement
[CDCC, 2007].
The uranium industry has a similar legacy of poor
ventilation in underground mines and mills, resulting in
hazardous exposures to respirable silica, radon and yellow
cake that placed miners and millers at risk for progressive
ﬁbrotic lung disease as well as lung cancer and other malignancies [Archer et al., 1976, 1998]. Much of the U.S.
production of uranium was linked to the nuclear defense
industry and the Cold War, but regulatory changes and
oversight of mining operations did not become common
until the 1980s. Historically, uranium mining in the
western U.S. had signiﬁcant health impacts on vulnerable
populations in tribal communities and among Native
American workers [Amandus and Costello, 1991; Carta
et al., 1994; Darby et al., 1995; Mapel et al., 1997]. Current expansion of uranium extraction by in situ leaching
techniques along with stricter regulatory oversight has
eliminated some of the previous hazards of underground
mining, though environmental and health effects of these
newer techniques are unknown.
The oil and gas industry remains a cornerstone
of U.S. energy policy. Production of natural gas used for
fuel, heat and electricity has increased and, in 2008,
30% of natural gas was used to produce electricity [National Academies Press, 2010]. Newer technologies,
such as hydraulic fracturing or ‘‘fracking,’’ have expanded production into previously unattainable or prohibitively costly reserves of natural gas and oil. Within
the last 10 years, the rapid expansion of the industry has
led to an increase in fatality rates and reported injuries
[CDCC, 2008]. Fatalities in the oil and gas industry
accounted for almost two-thirds of the fatal work injuries in the mining sector in 2007 [National Academies
Press, 2010]. The health consequences of exposure to a
variety of toxic substances associated with fracking (including respirable silica, lead, volatile organic compounds and irritant chemicals) are well known, though
exposure prevention strategies in the industry are in
their infancy.
Extractive industries have had a long history of boom
and bust cycles, often with hidden or unacknowledged
costs to workers and communities. Society must acknowledge all of these costs so that the risks to worker health
and safety as well as environmental and social costs are
addressed in concert with the expansion of the renewable
energy industries.
RENEWABLE ENERGY
Hydroelectric Power
The use of hydroelectric power, the production of
electrical power through the use of gravitational force of
falling or ﬂowing water, began in the late 1800s. It is inarguably a low-carbon output renewable energy source.
However, multiple hazards may attend the development,
construction, and operation of these facilities.
The heyday of American hydroelectric dam construction occurred in the 1920s and 1930s, a convergence of
rural electriﬁcation efforts and New Deal funding. From
the time of its completion in 1942, Grand Coulee Dam on
the Columbia River in Washington was the world’s highest-yield hydroelectric facility, until being surpassed by
two projects: the Simon Bolivar (Guri) in 1978 in Venezuela and Itaipu in 1984 in Brazil. All have been eclipsed
by the massive Three Gorges Dam in China, the ﬁrst
phase of which was completed in 2008. There are prospects for other large hydroelectric projects in China, the
Russian Federation, on the Congo River in central Africa,
and in Canada [Wikipedia, 2011].
While hydroelectric dam projects are relatively mature in the lower 48 states [U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2009], major new hydroelectric sites are
being considered in Alaska, foremost among these are the
Susitna and Chakhachamna projects on the Susitna River
drainage [Alaska Energy Authority, 2010]. The U.S. hydropower industry currently accounts for approximately
200,000 jobs and with expansion of the industry by 2050
could account for 230,000–700,000 jobs (both direct and
indirect) [National Hydropower Association, 2011].
While surveying and planning for such large earthworks have inherent hazards, the most signiﬁcant occupational risks occur during the construction phase. For
instance, during 3-year construction of the Grand Coulee

Dam there were 77 work-related fatalities [Saul, 2005]. Hydroelectric dam construction involves massive excavation
and earthmoving, materials handling operations with ﬁll
and concrete operations, and the immense steelworks necessary for spillways as well as concrete reinforcement. Occupational hazards include injuries from vehicle and heavy
equipment operations, falls, and crush injuries, exposure
hazards from cutting, welding, and brazing from metal and
ﬂux fumes, silica dust, and noise and severe ocular hazards.
Once these facilities are operational, there are many
potential acute injury hazards. These range from electric
shock, explosions, machinery entanglement, and drowning. There are chemical and metal exposure hazards including those inherent to the huge batteries deployed in
some of the facilities (such as nickel–cadmium and vanadium), chlorine used in water processing, and the polychlorinated
biphenyls
formerly
used
in
electrical
transformers and other components. Unanticipated exposures related to geography may occur. In Canada, hydroelectric plant workers exposed to the remains of caddis
ﬂies present in a hydroelectric plant developed a positive
response to caddis ﬂy antigen and developed occupational
allergies and occupational asthma [Kraut et al., 1994; Miedinger et al., 2012]. After sufﬁcient time for the oxidation
(rusting) of iron or steel contents, conﬁned spaces in such
structures can become oxygen depleted, posing a hazard
for rapid suffocation. Less well-characterized hazards
include those from the strong electric ﬁelds from massive
generators and during proximate transmission of the
resulting electricity [International Labor Organization,
1998].
Given the long history of development of hydroelectric projects, the hazards and injury risks during the construction phase have been well characterized and safety
plans, if followed, should reduce or eliminate occupational
injuries and fatalities. However, such safety plans do not
often take into account the long term health effects of
exposures such as PCBs, metals, and strong electrical
ﬁelds, and further work is needed to better characterize
and eliminate these hazards.
BIOMASS ENERGY
Biomass energy is derived from the combustion of renewable organic materials. ‘‘Traditional’’ biomass energy
is generated with the direct combustion of wood and manure, while ‘‘modern’’ sources include liquid, gaseous,
and solid biomass based fuels and are referred to as biofuels [Bringezu et al., 2009]. Biomass currently makes up
50% of the United States renewable energy supply, and is
predominantly supplied by wood or wood derived fuels,
followed by biofuels [U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2008]. The U.S. Energy Independence and Security Act, 2007 Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), has set
targets to signiﬁcantly increase biofuel production by
2022 by increasing the number of bio-reﬁneries and by
the expansion of new and emerging biofuel production
technologies. According to the Renewable Fuels Association [Renewable Fuel Association, 2011], in 2011 there
were 204 bioethanol plants in the U.S., with 70,400 workers involved in the production of ethanol and the delivery
of goods and services to ethanol producers. It is estimated
that the advanced biofuel industry could employ up to
29,000 people in 2012 and 94,000 by 2016 [Bio-Economic
Research Associates, 2009].
Lifecycle and economic assessments for biofuel production have received a great deal of attention [Marchetti
and Errazu, 2008; Debolt et al., 2009; Kiwjaroun et al.,
2009; Luo et al., 2009; Monti et al., 2009; Reinhard and
Zah, 2009; Riviere and Marlair, 2009; Yee et al., 2009;
Zah et al., 2009; Berndes et al., 2010; Gmunder et al.,
2010; Guinee et al., 2010; Hecht and Miller, 2010; Hytonen and Stuart, 2010; Morais et al., 2010; Talens Peiro
et al., 2010; Tsoutsos et al., 2010; de Vries et al., 2010;
Campbell et al., 2011; Cherubini and Stromman, 2011;
Esteban et al., 2011; Gottschalk and Nowack, 2011; Khoo
et al., 2011; Kou and Zhao, 2011; Malca and Freire, 2011;
Sanz Requena et al., 2011; Reno et al., 2012]. In contrast,
occupational health and safety (OHS) assessment in biofuel production often appears to be an afterthought, usually
attracting a single paragraph or two in papers predominantly focused on economic and environmental impacts.
Only a handful of journal articles, conference papers or
government reports speciﬁcally discuss OHS issues [Mittelbach et al., 2007; Harper et al., 2008; Madsen et al.,
2009; Marlair et al., 2009; Riviere and Marlair, 2009;
Powell, 2010; Law et al., 2011] even though there have
been a number of occupational fatalities within the biofuel
industry [Occupational Safety and Health Administration,
2011a].
Biofuel industry jobs include scientists working in research and development on engineering algae for biofuel
production, agricultural workers involved in the production and harvesting of biomass feedstocks from ﬁeld and
forest, production engineers and technicians processing
biomass, and transport workers delivering the fuel. The
risks for fatal and non-fatal injuries among agricultural
workers are well known. In addition, biofuel production
workers may face exposure to hazardous materials such as
acids, bases, and gasoline, as well as ﬁre, explosion and
electrical hazards [Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 2011a]. Potential biofuel industry exposures
include both familiar and novel health hazards. Familiar
hazards can be deﬁned as those with well characterized
risks or having current occupational exposure guidelines.
Many of the recent injuries and fatalities have been due to
well-known hazards with improper use of safety systems
[Harper et al., 2008; Occupational Safety and Health
1362

Administration, 2011a]. For the novel and less well characterized hazards, including bioaerosols and nanomaterials, there is limited acute and chronic health risk data and
no occupational exposure guidelines.
A wide variety of microorganisms are utilized in the
biofuels industry, with potential worker exposure to bioaerosols. For example, inhaled endotoxins can trigger immune responses leading to a range of respiratory system
responses [Sigsgaard et al., 2005]. Endotoxin exposure has
been described in the mass manufacture of bioproteins
(single cell bacteria) used for animal feed supplements. In
that industry, workers reported symptoms of fever, fatigue,
chest tightness and skin dryness [Sikkeland et al., 2008],
and had elevated levels of inﬂammatory cytokines [Sikkeland et al., 2008, 2009] and changes in lung function
[Skogstad et al., 2005]. There is limited data on bioaerosol
exposure from biofuel production. Respirable dust from
biofuel plants has been reported to elicit strong inﬂammatory responses in experimentally exposed mice, and high
endotoxin concentrations have been measured during use
of straw and woodchip biomass feedstock [Madsen et al.,
2004; Madsen, 2006; Madsen et al., 2009].
The spectrum of reported biological effects and health
conditions associated with bioaerosol exposure include airway inﬂammation [Allermann and Poulsen, 2000; Wouters
et al., 2002; Heldal et al., 2003; de Meer et al., 2007],
altered lung function [Eduard et al., 1993; Post et al.,
1998; Mandryk et al., 1999; Mandryk et al., 2000; Fishwick et al., 2001; Heldal et al., 2003; Douwes et al., 2006;
Reynolds et al., 2006; Bu¨nger et al., 2007; Pahwa et al.,
2009], Organic Dust Toxic Syndrome [Carvalheiro et al.,
1994; Boehmer et al., 2009], increased permeability of the
lung-blood barrier [Daneshzadeh Tabrizi et al., 2010], immunological reactions [Go´ra et al., 2004; Gripenback
et al., 2005; Muller et al., 2006; Reynolds et al., 2006;
Burch et al., 2009; Daneshzadeh Tabrizi et al., 2010;
Poole et al., 2010], and increased prevalence of asthma,
cough, gastrointestinal illness and/or eye and nasal irritation [Douwes et al., 2001; Eduard et al., 2001; Rusca
et al., 2008; Jacobsen et al., 2009].
Engineered nanomaterials are deﬁned as those with
structural components between 1 and 100 nanometers that
provide unique properties not evident in the parent material [Centers for Disease Control-National Institute for Occupational
Safety
and
Health,
2011a].
Engineered
nanomaterial research has developed rapidly over the last
decade, but the potential occupational health risks associated with manufacturing, processing and handling of nanomaterials are not well characterized [Koukoulaki, 2010;
Lee et al., 2010]. Manufactured nanomaterials and nanosized catalysts have been explored in the trans-esteriﬁcation reactions for both bioethanol and biodiesel. Some
nanoparticles can penetrate biological barriers to access
biological
system
inaccessible
by
larger
particles,
a
concern because the manipulation of the nanomaterial
properties may also alter their toxicity [Institute of Occupational Medicine, 2011]. Carbon nanotubes have been
reported to have asbestos-like pathogenicity in the abdominal cavity of mice [Poland et al., 2008], and may increase
risk for mesothelioma due to their potential for retention
in the pleural membrane [Safe Work Australia, 2010; Murphy et al., 2011]. The paucity of data on the adverse
chronic health effects from use of engineered nanomaterials indicates a need for full risk assessment as these products are used in biofuel production.
The paucity of OHS data for biofuel production is of
concern as the technology is evolving rapidly. A comprehensive risk assessment of biofuel production would need
to involve an assessment of biomass feedstock production
including observation of known hazards within agricultural, forestry and the waste treatment and recycling industries [Mahar et al., 1999; Allermann and Poulsen, 2000;
Douwes et al., 2003; Bu¨nger et al., 2007; Greskevitch et
al., 2008; Burch et al., 2009; Schenker et al., 2009], as
well as goods transportation [Purdy, 1993; Jones et al.,
2005; Verma and Verter, 2007; Salmoni et al., 2008; Centers for Disease Control-National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 2011b] and petroleum reﬁneries
[Jewett, 1934; World Health Organization, 1998]. It would
be prudent to proactively introduce exposure controls in
occupational environments in conjunction with further
characterization of potential health risks in exposure research laboratories.
SOLAR ENERGY: PHOTOVOLTAICS
Photovoltaic (PV) devices convert sunlight directly to
electricity using semiconductor and related materials, similar to those used in the computer and ﬂat-panel display industries. Although PV remains small in the portfolio of
electricity-producing renewable energy technologies, the industry has averaged 50% growth in module production
from 2000 to 2009 and over a 100% growth in 2010 due to
rapid expansion, primarily in China [Solar Industries Energy Association, 2011a]. According to the Solar Energy
Industries Association (SEIA), the U.S. solar industry
employs almost 100,000 workers across all ﬁfty states
[Solar Industries Energy Association, 2011b], and is projected to support over half a million American jobs by
2016. With continued rapid growth rates, PV will contribute
signiﬁcantly to world electricity production, with a number
of accompanying occupational safety and health concerns.
PV modules are primarily deployed as ﬂat panels in
arrays, either in large ﬁelds or rooftops. These conversion
technologies are primarily crystalline silicon (c Si) wafers
(200 mm thick), but the use of thin-ﬁlm materials
(<10 mm
thick)
is
growing
rapidly.
Thin-ﬁlm
PVconversion materials include cadmium-telluride (Cd Te)),

hydrogenated amorphous silicon (Si:H), and Copper–
Indium–Gallium–Selenide (CIGS), in decreasing order of
module production. There is increasing interest in a technology known as concentrating PV (CPV) that uses high
performing and high cost cells based on gallium arsenide
(Ga As).
Occupational health and safety challenges are likely
to be variable across a wide spectrum of PV work tasks
and settings. PV industry jobs include scientists and engineers improving materials and device performance; those
who develop pilot manufacturing facilities; miners and
millers of the mineral components; workers in factories
manufacturing modules, power electronics and related
products and equipment; those who plan and develop sites;
those who install panels and integrate them into an electrical grid; and transportation jobs across the value chain.
While PV produces electricity without using any fuel,
moving parts, or water, there are speciﬁc hazards associated with PV manufacturing and deployment [Fthenakis,
2003].
In
the
silicon-based
conversion
technologies,
manufacturing hazards include the use of acids (e.g., HF,
NH03) and caustic solutions (e.g., Na OH), as well as hazardous production material (HPM) gases such as phosphine, diborane, ammonia, and the pyrophoric gas, silane.
The technology is similar to computer chip manufacturing
for c Si and ﬂat-panel displays, and there are a numerous
codes and standards available to address the hazards present in silicon-based PV manufacturing.
In the cadmium–telluride (Cd Te)-based conversion
technologies, the primary manufacturing hazard is the use
of heavy metals in both solid and liquid sources. Exposure
to Cd-containing materials can occur in both the deposition of the various layers within the PV cell and the removal of Cd-containing materials. While the toxicity of
Cd (acute pneumonitis, chronic lung and renal disease,
lung and prostate cancer) is well known [Agency for Toxic
Substances and Disease Registry, 2011], little is known
about the toxicity of alloys of Cd, such as Cd Te, other
than it has a much lower water solubility than Cd and is
an area for further research.
The manufacturing of CIGS poses a potential risk of
exposure to heavy metals (copper, indium, gallium, selenium) with varying degrees of toxicity. While the elemental
toxicity of the materials is well known, the toxicity of the
alloys is less well characterized and is an area for further
study. Most of the CIGS industry does not use hydrogen
selenide (H2Se), a highly toxic HPM gas, to introduce selenium (Se) into the CIGS layer, but the practice does exist. Other hazard risks include the reaction of Se in the
deposition chambers with water vapor during cleaning
operations, and the formation of H2Se during maintenance. With inhalation exposure, H2Se is a mucous membrane irritant, and can cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness,
and pneumonitis as well as frostbite with skin contact
[Centers for Disease Control-National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 2011c].
In the Ga As-based conversion technologies used in
CPV, the primary manufacturing hazard is the use of
HPMs, speciﬁcally highly toxic gases and liquid sources
(e.g., arsine causing massive red blood cell hemolysis
leading to global cellular hypoxia; phosphine causing convulsions, cardiac dysrhythmias, and shock). While the
codes and standards for these technologies have been developed in radiation-hard computer chip manufacturing,
the potential acute risk of these materials to workers is
signiﬁcant.
There are common hazards across the PV industry.
Materials such as metals and transparent conducting
oxides (TCOs) are used by all the technologies. TCO, indium-tin-oxide (ITO), has been linked to pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in manufacturing workers and is the focus
of on-going studies by NIOSH [Cummings et al., 2010].
Early indications are that the toxicity of ITO is greater
than that of its core elements.
The installation of photovoltaic panels combines three
occupations that have high morbidity and mortality—
rooﬁng, carpentry and electrical work. Solar energy equipment can generate electrical energy and may be connected
to electrical circuits. Workers installing or servicing solar
panels may be electrocuted from the unexpected release of
stored energy. In addition, the risk for falls is high among
installers. Falls are the leading cause of construction fatalities and account for one-third of the on-the-job injury
deaths in the construction industry [The Center for Construction Research and Training, 2008]. The speciﬁc hazards that contribute to falls and other injuries in solar
industry include pitched roofs, working too close to the
roof’s edge, lack of fall protection, proximity to overhead
power lines and unguarded skylights. There are many methods to implement safety procedures and practices for lockout/tagout and fall protection to prevent serious injury and
death, and companies that install panels need to have safety
plans that involves speciﬁc training and oversight for compliance. Less obvious hazards include burns associated with
deploying concentrating optics in direct sunlight.
The industry has been proactive in the area of recycling PV system components at their end of life or after
failure or damage. There is a need to protect workers in
the recycling industry who may be at risk from exposure
to metals and other hazardous components.
WIND POWER
Wind power can be used to generate electricity by
harnessing the power of the wind to drive blades to rotate
around either a horizontal or vertical axis that is connected
to a gear box and a generator. The American Wind Energy
Association (AWEA) reports that the U.S. wind industry

installed over 1,000 megawatts of wind power in the second quarter of 2011, bringing the U.S. cumulative capacity
to 42,432 megawatts, and that U.S. wind power capacity
is 20% of the world’s wind power. This rapid growth is
supported by approximately 400 raw material suppliers
and manufacturers of various components of wind energy
including nacelles (the box-like component that sits atop
the tower, connected to the rotor and containing components such as the gearbox, generator, and main frame),
blades, and towers, as well as the installers and maintainers of wind farms.
Wind energy employed approximately 75,000 U.S.
workers in 2010 [American Wind Energy Association,
2011], and the Bureau of Labor Statistics anticipates that
employment will continue to grow. Most current wind energy jobs are in the manufacturing sector. Wind energy
components are manufactured throughout the U.S. or are
imported from international equipment manufacturers or
suppliers. Other wind energy jobs are in construction, operation, and maintenance. Job growth in operations and
maintenance is expected as new wind farms are brought
on-line and older wind farms are upgraded to include
newer and more efﬁcient technology.
Speciﬁc occupations include research and development scientists; machinists, assemblers, and welders to
manufacture components; engineers to design components,
select and permit sites and manage wind farm installations; construction workers including those skilled in concrete and steel foundations; transportation workers; and
operations and maintenance technicians [Hamilton and
Liming, 2010].
To understand the hazards associated with erecting
wind towers, installing blades and turbines, and maintaining the equipment, the size and height of these units must
be considered. The speciﬁcations of a 1.5 MW turbine
manufactured by General Electric include a blade length
of 116 feet, operating at a maximum tip speed of 183
miles per hour at a tower height of 328 feet. The turbine
housing, or nacelle, weighs over 56 tons, the blade assembly weighs over 36 tons, and the whole tower assembly
totals over 163 tons [General Electric Company, 2011].
The Caithness Windfarm Information Forum 2011
compiled and analyzed all reported wind turbine related
accidents from the 1970s through June 2011 [Caithness
Windfarm, 2011]. Their research documented 83 fatalities,
58 of which were wind industry workers or small turbine
owner/operators. The remaining 25 fatalities were among
the public, including ﬁre ﬁghters and transport workers
not directly dependent on the wind industry. The report
described 208 incidents of blade failure, resulting in
pieces of the blade or even the entire blade thrown from
the turbine; 159 ﬁres, two of which burned wind industry
workers; 116 incidents of structural failure; 31 incidents
of ice throw, some of which resulted in human injury; and
74 reported accidents related to transport of turbine sections [Caithness Windfarm, 2011].
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) describes wind energy hazards that include: falls
both during erection and maintenance compounded by
high winds; conﬁned spaces; ﬁres; unexpected energizing
or startup of machinery and equipment, or the release of
hazardous energy during service or maintenance activities;
limited availability of medical and ﬁrst aid; working
around cranes, derricks, and hoists; arc ﬂash, including arc
ﬂash burn and blast hazards, electric shock, and thermal
burn hazards that can cause injury and death; and
manufacturing-related hazards, including machine-related
hazards associated with moving parts, electrical hazards,
and machine guarding, and health hazards from operations
such as bufﬁng and resurfacing that may expose workers
to harmful gases, vapors, and dusts [Occupational Safety
and Health Administration, 2011b]. OSHA notes that these
hazards are not unique, and there are OSHA standards that
cover them.
As traditional jobs evolve to meet new challenges,
workers may be faced with known risks that had not previously affected their speciﬁc occupation. These changes
may also present employers with the opportunity to eliminate hazards through planning, organization, and engineering—a concept known at NIOSH as Prevention through
Design (Pt D) [Centers for Disease Control-National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 2010]. This concept addresses occupational safety and health needs in the
design process to prevent or minimize the work-related
hazards and risks associated with the construction, manufacture, use, maintenance, and disposal of facilities, materials, and equipment. As wind energy components are
designed, and the process for constructing, operating and
maintaining the systems are engineered, occupational
health and safety hazards should be identiﬁed and eliminated, if possible, and the risks associated with the
remaining hazards should be minimized through effective
use of engineering controls.
SUMMARY
Reliance on renewable energy in the United States
has increased dramatically in recent years. Studies of
worker safety in renewable energy industries are limited,
and most of what we know is based on studies from
Europe [Markandya and Wilkinson, 2007]. Investigations
into the long-term occupational health effects of the
emerging renewable energy methods of biomass, solar,
and wind are virtually non-existent. The lack of information on the hazards of working in the renewable energy
industry emphasizes the need for occupational health and
safety research in this ﬁeld but also raises the question of
how to focus and prioritize such research.

The MAP ERC 2011 Energy Summit brought together thought leaders and researchers to frame the dialogue
on occupational safety and health research and prevention
in the renewable energy industry. Summit participants emphasized the importance of applying lessons learned from
the extractive energy industry and applying current knowledge of hazardous materials and processes used in the renewable energy industry to frame future research and
policy directions.
The discussions identiﬁed several areas of concern.
Exposures with potential chronic health effects, particularly
for diseases of longer latency, are more challenging to
identify and study, and may require monitoring of exposure
levels, long term clinical follow-up of exposed individuals,
and well-designed systems for epidemiologic surveillance.
It is unclear if the renewable energy industries are being
proactive in establishing medical or exposure monitoring
systems for early identiﬁcation of work-related risks.
Another area of concern was the challenge posed by
numerous small facilities involved in the renewable industries compared to fewer larger ones. Larger facilities make
implementation of expensive engineering controls to reduce the risk of occupational injury and illness more
cost-effective. Additionally, larger industries generally are
better able to bear the costs of comprehensive industrial
hygiene monitoring and epidemiologic surveillance.
The following sections summarize the known and potential occupational hazards of materials and processes
used in each of the major emerging renewable energy
industries
along
with
recommendations
for
research
directions.
Biomass
Biomass operations range from large, industrial bioethanol plants to small fermentation devices on family
farms. Current and potential hazards range from the wellrecognized hazards of wood combustion to the seldom
studied hazards of genetically modiﬁed microorganisms
used in biofuel production. Unlike solar and wind, biomass requires production of the ‘‘fuel,’’ generally by
production agriculture, one of the most hazardous occupations in industrialized countries.
For biomass, basic research is needed on the toxicity
and immunogenicity of emerging biomass hazards including
bioaerosols,
nanotechnology,
genetically
modiﬁed
microorganisms, and other agents used in the rapidly
evolving biomass technologies. This basic research should
be complemented by prospective cohort studies of workers
in the ﬁeld including monitoring of exposure levels and
long-term follow-up of exposed individuals. Because so
little is known of the hazards in production of biomass
and generating energy from it, prudent exposure controls
will be needed for the foreseeable future.
Solar Energy
Photovoltaic technologies use a number of potentially
hazardous materials including rare earth and heavy metals.
While photovoltaics share many materials and technologies
with microprocessor production, PV manufacturing does
not typically utilize the emission controls used in ‘‘clean
room’’ microprocessor production. Accordingly, extrapolation of health and safety data from microprocessors to photovoltaics is not supportable without detailed exposure
monitoring. Installation of PV panels involves the hazards
of rooﬁng, carpentry, and electrical work by numerous
small contractors in worksites that are seldom ideal.
Research needs include basic studies on the toxicity
of rare earth elements and newer semi-conductors. These
studies should include toxicological research at a range of
exposure levels. In addition, prospective cohort studies of
workers in manufacturing and installation of photovoltaics
should be undertaken with particular attention to exposure
levels and long-term health effects. As for solar energy,
because relatively little is known of the long-term danger
of exposure to many of the materials used in photovoltaics, prudent exposure controls in combination with
worker medical surveillance will be needed for the foreseeable future.
Wind
Wind power manufacturing and generation does not
involve occupational exposure to as many emerging hazardous materials as biomass (i.e., nanomaterials) or less
common materials as photovoltaics (i.e., rare earth and
heavy metals). The occupational hazards of wind power
include those of heavy equipment manufacturing and construction of large elevated structures. A signiﬁcant hazard
in the wind industry is the risk of falls or other injury
during maintenance in windy conditions at a considerable
height on wind turbine towers that may not have been
designed with worker safety in mind.
Because the processes and materials used in wind
power are more familiar than many of those used in biomass and photovoltaics, there is little need for basic research in this ﬁeld. Cohort studies of workers in wind
power
manufacturing,
construction,
and
maintenance
should be undertaken to identify any unanticipated hazards
and to better quantify known or anticipated hazards.
In the worldview of economists, both occupational
and environmental hazards are externalities of energy production, hidden costs not fully included or internalized in
the market price of fuel, thus distorting true costs. Historically, occupational health effects from higher exposures in
industrial settings often presaged future adverse effects on
the general population from lower-dose environmental
exposures. Using workers as ‘‘canaries in the coal mine’’

to detect adverse exposure circumstances is not an ideal
approach to environmental risk management. With this understanding, opportunities to anticipate and prevent future
exposure risks in the renewable energy industry should not
be squandered.
In summary, new materials and processes used in renewable energy, particularly biomass and photovoltaics,
requires basic research on cellular and speciﬁc end-organ
effects. Prospective cohort studies with careful exposure
measurement and clinical monitoring should be implemented. With the need to identify chronic as well as acute
effects, these studies will need to be long-term. The relative paucity of our knowledge of worker health and safety
risks in the ﬁeld calls for particular care in limiting exposures. Only with worker health and safety as part of the
equation will we know the true cost of renewable energy
and how to factor that into U.S. energy policy.
