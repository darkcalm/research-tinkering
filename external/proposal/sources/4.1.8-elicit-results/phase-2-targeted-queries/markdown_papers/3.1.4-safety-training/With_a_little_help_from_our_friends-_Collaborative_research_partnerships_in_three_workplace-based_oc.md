Abstract.
BACKGROUND: Research conducted in collaboration between academic and non-academic partners (known as integrated
knowledge translation [i KT]) in the ﬁeld of occupational health and safety needs to be evaluated.
OBJECTIVE: This study examined three collaborative workplace-based intervention projects that focused on reducing
exposure to occupational carcinogens. Practice, policy and advocacy intermediary organizations partnered with multidisciplinary groups of researchers. This evaluation study sought to understand the characteristics of successful and unsuccessful
i KT partnerships from the perspective of the intermediaries.
METHODS: Researchers conducted face-to-face interviews with 21 intermediaries and used a thematic-driven “framework
analysis” method to analyze the interviews, based upon an evolving conceptual framework.
RESULTS: Seven enablers and barriers of collaboration were identiﬁed. Enablers included having: adequate capacity;
deﬁned project roles; the right partners; an inclusive project leader; mutual respect; good communication; and shared values
and priorities. Lacking these was considered a barrier. Seven outcomes were identiﬁed as: improved relevance and quality
of the research; learning about each others’ “world”; building contacts; improved use of research in practice and policy;
dissemination of the research; development of trust and goodwill; and continued collaborations.
CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations for future collaborative studies include: spend time deﬁning roles, responsibilities, and
expectations; ensure practitioners have the time and resources, and the commitment to the project; and choose representatives
from the organizations with the necessary skills or decision-making mandate.
Keywords: Integrated knowledge translation, occupational disease, intermediaries as research partners, workplace intervention research

1. Introduction to integrated knowledge
translation (i KT)
1.1. (Integrated) knowledge translation
The ﬁeld of knowledge translation conﬁrms that
“research to practice” is difﬁcult to achieve in all
ﬁelds including healthcare, education, and the social
sciences. The gap between research ﬁndings in the
ﬁeld of occupational health and safety, and their use
by practitioners also continues to be a challenge. The
research on knowledge translation that has examined methods to bridge this gap has highlighted the
beneﬁts of the collaboration of researchers and practitioners/partners during the research process. The
Canadian Institutes for Health Research, Canada’s
largest federal funder of health research has taken the
lead in advocating for this collaborative method of
research. They call it “Integrated Knowledge Translation” (i KT) [1, 2]. The research on i KT has found
that the collaborative research model: 1) improves
the likelihood that the researchers and practitioners/partners will increase their understanding and
value of each others’ world [2–6]; 2) rebalances what
is considered ‘expertise’ [4]; 3) increases the networking across the groups and therefore the spread of
knowledge [3–5, 7]; and 4) results in ﬁndings that are
more signiﬁcant than either group could individually
contribute [4].
Despite this growing literature, how to achieve
a well-integrated collaboration between researchers
and practitioners/partners has not been clearly
deﬁned. There is yet to be a blueprint on which to
base i KT activities. The literature has been criticized
for not including sufﬁcient details of the process [8].
The practitioners/partners are often only involved to
a limited extent in the research [9]. There is no underlying theory that reinforces the research; this can be
a barrier to cross-project learning [2]. The evaluation of the implementation of i KT is often considered
anecdotal and hence inadequate [2].
1.2. Intermediaries as knowledge users and
research partners
Another issue worth highlighting is that the practitioners who become partners on an i KT study can
include anyone with a stake in the potential ﬁndings and who could use the ﬁndings. They could
be decision-makers that come from the community,
industry, clinicians, government policy-makers, or
the media [10]. Hence using the catch-all-phrase,
“partners”, is appropriate. In healthcare, the partners in a research study could be the patients, the
clinicians, the hospital administrators, or healthcare
policy-makers. In occupational health and safety,
the partners in a research study could be the
workers, supervisors, managers, owners, health and
safety associations, industry organizations, organized
labour, or government policy-makers. The partners
who join a research team could represent themselves
or represent their organizations.
In many projects, the ability to reach the end-users
of research ﬁndings (patients or workers, in the two
ﬁelds respectively) is a logistical challenge. For expediency’s sake, it makes more sense for researchers to
have research partners who are “intermediaries” –
organizations, associations, societies, or unions who
have existing networks of relationships with the endusers and ways of communicating with them. These
intermediaries are trusted and are considered credible
communicators. They understand the context and cultures of the end-users (processes, political and social
ties,limitations,andinfrastructure).Importantly,they
are able to adapt the research ﬁndings to the endusers’ needs [2].
Despite these advantages, there has been limited
examination in the ﬁeld of occupational health and
safety of how health and safety organizations, industry associations, policy-makers, suppliers of goods
and services, membership organizations, educational
organizations, government agencies, or others [11]
can be partners and collaborators in research.
Responding to this need, nearly a decade ago,
based on research conducted in the early 2000’s
(published in 2010), members of this article’s
research team attempted to evaluate the involvement of intermediaries as research partners in three
workplace-health interventions [12]. The intermediaries were four Ontario-based health and safety
associations. The analysis was conducted in the early
years of i KT. It explored whether the researchers
and the intermediary associations had found the
collaboration worthwhile and worth repeating. The
associations as partners on the study helped the
researchers recruit the workplaces, navigate the
workplaces’ hierarchies, territorial barriers, and organizational politics, and gain the cooperation of the
workers. The study concluded that the relationship
was worth repeating, and that future efforts should
focus on building rich relationships through “frequent interactions, exchanges of information, and
the opportunity to work on mutual projects”. It also
identiﬁed the need for future research to clarify the

collaborative model. This 2010 study helped inform
the approach taken by the authors in their subsequent collaborative research projects. However, the
2010 study did not fully answer the question “What
are the elements of the i KT collaborative partnership
of researchers and knowledge users that could predict success?” These are the questions that this study
attempts to answer.
1.3. Expanding our knowledge of the role of
intermediaries
This present study has attempted to respond to the
identiﬁed shortcomings in the larger i KT literature
and to build on the 2010 study with intermediaries.
The present study examines the i KT collaborations
of researchers and intermediary practice partners
(IPP) in three projects: one provincial and two
national. These three workplace-based i KT projects
were respectively named Sun Safety at Work Canada,
the Burden of Occupational Cancer, and Completing the Picture (Table 1 offers a comparison of the
three studies). The common objective of the projects
was examining ways to prevent or reduce occupational exposure to carcinogens. The studies were
multidisciplinary and had researchers from multiple
research centres. However, they were either led or
co-investigated by researchers from the Occupational
Cancer Research Centre (OCRC), a provinciallyfunded research centre based at Cancer Care
Ontario.
The three projects varied in duration from 2.5 to
four years. They differed in the number of researchers
and IPPs (from one organization to 12). They have
all recently completed their funding cycles. The IPPs
were involved from the inception of the studies
through to their evaluation but were not necessarily
involved at every stage of the process.
A decision was made by the researchers to focus
this study on qualitative feedback from the IPP representatives about their experiences on the three
projects. A decision was made not to examine the
experience of the researchers, but to focus only on
the intermediaries’ perspectives (this is a difference
from the 2010 study that included both perspectives).
Through 22 one-on-one interviews and one twoperson interview, the researchers sought to examine
the nature of the i KT activities/collaborations that
facilitated the partnership; the enablers and barriers;
the i KT approaches that were adopted; and the impact
the partnership had on the intermediaries’ dissemination of the research ﬁndings.
The research questions that framed this study are:
• What are the characteristics of successful and
unsuccessful i KT partnerships?
• What are the outcomes of i KT partnerships?
• What are the factors that researchers might consider at the outset of an i KT partnership so as to
facilitate success?
2. Overview of the three projects
2.1. Sun Safety at Work Canada
The aim of the Sun Safety at Work Canada project
was to enhance sun safety for outdoor workers. The
funder was the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer.
The cross-Canada project team that led the project
included 5 researchers, 9 intermediary practice partners (IPPs), and a total of 15 staff were engaged
over the 2.5 years of the project. (The project has
been described in more detail in three manuscripts
[13–15].)
The project’s IPPs had different mandates, but their
focus was broadly on preventing occupational disease or preventing skin cancer in particular. Although
the IPPs were categorized as policy or practice, individuals often spanned multiple roles. In the project,
the IPPs helped recruit the workplaces and supervise the project’s knowledge brokers. When ﬁndings
became available, the IPPs integrated those into their
dissemination/diffusion activities. The IPPs helped
design the evaluation strategy including the baseline
assessments of the workplaces (study sites), facilitated data collection, helped with creating resources
for the workplaces, helped develop a project website
and materials for the website, and set up presentations
with stakeholder groups. The researchers conducted
the qualitative and quantitative data analysis and
wrote the reports and manuscripts.
The team met face-to-face four times. They also
met monthly by teleconference for one hour in the
ﬁrst six months and then monthly for 1.5 hours. Subcommittees were formed for tackling certain aspects
of the project and they met by teleconference weekly
or bi-weekly.
2.2. Burden of Occupational Cancer
The aim of the Burden of Occupational Cancer
project was to assess the number of cancers, cancer
deaths and associated economic costs occurring in

Phase 1: Knowledge brokerled workplace interventions
in 17 workplaces with three
time points of evaluation
which included interviews,
surveys, UV dosimetry,
observation, and document
analysis.
Phase 2: Project partners spread
evidence on occupational sun safety
and ﬁndings from Phase 1 to external
stakeholders.
A method was developed for
estimating the burden of
occupational cancer in Canada
based upon established
methods from other countries.
Epidemiologic data and cancer
statistics (for the most recent
census year, 2011) were applied
to determine the number of
cancers and their economic
burden.
The incorporation of a work
exposure survey into regular
clinical practice was trialed at
six community health clinics in
Ontario. The feasibility of
including the survey in routine
practice was explored at three
time points through interviews.

Canada due to exposure to workplace carcinogens.
This four-year project was funded by the Canadian
Cancer Society (CCS). A condition of funding was
that a division of CCS should be a partner in the study.
CCS’s Ontario Division became the IPP on the study.
The project has been described in more detail in a
report [16], and a manuscript [17].
The research question (What is the burden of occupational cancer?) was developed by researchers based
in four provinces. The project was informed by CCS’s
wish to know more about occupational and environmental carcinogens as part of its prevention and
lobbying initiatives. From four to eight practitioners
from CCS were identiﬁed as the primary IPPs for the
project. The grant application included a detailed plan
for i KT, including an evaluation of the partnership.
Initially, the researchers and a group from CCS
prioritized 44 occupational carcinogens and 24 different kinds of cancer. The IPPs were not involved in
choosing the study’s methodology or in conducting
the data analysis. The IPPs took the lead on disseminating the project’s ﬁndings and using the ﬁndings
in policy advocacy. They were kept up to date during
the project’s four years through regular (bi-monthly)
informal breakfasts and lunch meetings, as well at
more formal meetings that occurred about four to six
months apart. There were also conference-style meetingsattendedby CCSemployeesfromacross Canada.
At these conferences (one a year), the researchers
presented emerging ﬁndings.
2.3. Completing the Picture
The aim of the Completing the Picture project was
to determine the feasibility of integrating questions
about work and work exposures into routine primary
healthcare. This three-year project was funded by
CCS and the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
Six community Health Centres (CHCs) in Ontario
were chosen as the primary health care settings.
Two provincial occupational health and safety associations became the IPPs: the Occupational Health
Clinics for Ontario Workers, and the Public Services
Health and Safety Association. The project’s grant
proposal’s knowledge translation strategy included
collaboration with the partners, intensive engagement
with the CHCs, and a commitment to evaluate the
knowledge utilization of the CHCs.
The pilot study has been described in more detail
in two manuscripts [18, 19]. The research question
and the project’s design were formulated in consultation with the two IPPs. The grant was written
by the researchers and received sign-off and letters
of support from the IPPs. The budget covered the
expenses that might be incurred by the partners for
their involvement with the study.
This project was less explicitly laid out as an i KT
partnership, since emphasis was given to the relationship building between the knowledge broker on the
research team and the CHCs. However, the two IPPs
helped recruit the CHCs to the study. They helped
develop study tools. In the early stages of the project,
the researchers and IPPs met once per month, and
then several times per year in later stages at each of
the IPP’s individual workplaces.
The IPPs were not involved in the day-to-day
implementation at the CHCs, data collection or analysis. At the time the members from the two IPPs
were interviewed, the project was not totally complete and only preliminary ﬁndings were available.

Hence the IPPs had not initiated any dissemination
activities.
3. Methods
3.1. Ethics
Ethics approval from the Waterloo Region Community Research Ethics Ofﬁce was granted for the
Sun Safety at Work Canada and the Completing the
Picture projects, as well as for this sub-analysis of
the three projects’ i KT relationships. Ethics approval
for the Burden of Occupational Cancer study was
obtained from the University of Toronto Research
Ethics Board. The individual participants (IPPs)
consented to having their data published once all
identifying information was removed.
3.2. Study design
This study is based upon phenomenology theory
and understanding. It is a contained piece of condensed study based on the experiences gained from
three individual projects, that seeks to understand one
phenomenon, from the perspective of the participants, based upon a conceptual framework [20]. We
used this approach in order to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of the experience of the
IPPs during their participation in these collaborative
research partnerships.
3.3. Conceptual model
The conceptual model for this project’s evaluation
of i KT was adapted from Gagliardi et al.’s (2016)
“Summary of IKT approaches, inﬂuencing factors,
and outcomes” [2]. This model is an outcome of the
authors’ scoping review on i KT in healthcare. They
included all constructs that were identiﬁed in their
scopingreviewandnotedthatsomewerelessstrongly
represented in the literature than others. Their model
depicts any i KT approach as having Enablers, Barriers and Conditions that precede and inﬂuence it.
Examples of enablers in the model include having
capacity or infrastructure, having clear expectations
and responsibilities, and having high level recognition and commitment. Examples of barriers in
the model include not having time for i KT, having
differing timing, and having differing values. The
i KT approaches are the activities undertaken to support i KT such as writing evidence briefs, making a
web portal, and consultation. The conditions might
include the complexity of the health services issue,
involvement in different stages of the project, and the
current phase of the project. The i KT approach leads
to Outcomes,whichincluderelevanceoftheresearch,
quality of the research, and learning about research.
To review the full list of constructs, (see Fig. 2).
Congruentwith Gagliardietal.’s(2016)model,this
study identiﬁed a wide range of issues concerning
enablers, barriers, conditions, i KT approaches, and
outcomes of i KT partnerships. In the same way as
the Gagliardi et al.’s model reﬂected a scoping review
of i KT in healthcare, we have used some elements
of that model, modiﬁed other elements, and omitted
those which were deemed not relevant for this study
(see Fig. 1).
3.4. Data collection
Interviews were conducted face-to-face from June
2015 to May 2016. The 21 interviewees were the
partners on the three projects - seven from each
project. All IPPs who were not researchers were
included regardless of their level of involvement
in their project. Interviewees were categorized as
policy-makers (2), practitioners (17), or both (2).
The two in the “both” category had practitioner and
policy-maker roles in different organizations. The
experience of participants in the study ranged from
less than ﬁve years to over 30 years in private, not-forproﬁt, and government organizations. Roles spanned
from lower-level professionals up to Vice President
and President/CEO levels.
The interviews were conducted wherever the IPPs
felt most comfortable; most often in their ofﬁce.
Sometimes interviews were conducted at a caf´e or
restaurant. All the interviews were one-on-one with
one exception (two participants). All participants
agreed to be audio recorded with one exception.
Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim. Interviews lasted from 30 minutes to one hour, with a total
of almost 13 hours of audio recordings.
An interview guide was developed according to
an initial conceptual model. As the study progressed,
the interview guide evolved so as to explore emerging
themes. The conceptual model has also gone through
a number of iterations as we have come to learn more
about the characteristics of successful collaborative
researcher-practitioner partnerships. Figure 1 reﬂects
this emerging knowledge. The interviews focused on
the enablers and barriers, conditions, and outcomes
of the i KT approach. They speciﬁcally explored

project leadership, trust, relationships, money, role
deﬁnition, what worked well and not so well in the
partnership, and what the partners learned from the
experience.
3.5. Data analysis
The interviews were listened to multiple times to
understand tone and to gain a deeper understanding
of meaning. Transcripts were thematically coded in
NVivo10 using constructs in the conceptual model
as a priori codes. A “framework analysis” method
was used to analyze data in order to generate ﬁndings that would be more applicable to practice change
[21]. A matrix was developed that organized the three
projects along the horizontal axis and the codes along
the vertical axis. Data were added to the matrix in the
appropriate cell corresponding to the study and the
code. This analysis method is supported by Miles,
Huberman and Salda˜na [22] as it helps with distilling
the data and organizing it for ease of comparison (e.g.,
some codes were not strongly supported across all
three projects, and sometimes new themes emerged).
As new themes emerged, new codes were added to the
matrixallowingforaninductiveanalysis.Inasecondlevel analysis, our main themes were compared to the
variables identiﬁed by Gagliardi et al. (2016) in their
review of i KT in healthcare [2, Fig. 2].
4. Results
The following results from this overview of the
i KT collaborative partnership across three research
projects has been divided into two large categories:
1) Enablers and Barriers, and 2) Outcomes. Seven
enablers and barriers for researcher-practitioner partnerships, and seven outcomes from the researcherpractitioner partnerships emerged strongly in this
study.
4.1. Enablers and barriers
The seven enablers and barriers that emerged
included having: adequate capacity; deﬁned project
roles; the right partners; an inclusive project leader;
mutual respect; good communication; and shared values and priorities. Lacking these was considered a
barrier.
4.1.1. Capacity (money and time)
Having funding available to engage in the research
projects was very important. The IPPs said that their
individual organizations needed the research grant
money to buy out their time to dedicate to the projects.
“[Although this is] a very important research
question, we just really didn’t have the capacity or the resources on our own to look at that

exclusively. This partnership allowed us to do
that.”
In one project, having funding earmarked for the
project enabled the partner organization to keep the
project within their mandate. This was especially
important since the organization was undergoing signiﬁcant internal change and there were competing
claims on resources and priorities.
“I think [money] helps . . . . I think money drives
focus and money drives through dedicated investment and enables resources and accountability.”
Afewpartnerssaidthatfundingwasneededtocontinuetheproject’sworkaftertheofﬁcialgrantfunding
ended. However, the majority thought they had the
resources they needed to continue their commitment as disseminators and advocates of the research
ﬁndings.
“[Our organization] will always keep those documents up to date because it’s part of the core
work that we do. We don’t need any grant money
to keep that information out there because this is
what we do.”

269
Regardless of the money to support partner
organizations’ activities, a number of the partners
mentioned how little time they had to dedicate to
working on the projects. Many did this work “off
the side of their desks”. This ended up affecting how
involved they could be while the studies were being
conducted.
“I always like to be more involved but it’s always
a question of workload. So, I like to hear lots
about [the] research but [I] understand it’s not
our primary role.”
4.1.2. Project management/role
Many of the interviewees said they experienced
some confusion during the project regarding how it
was progressing and what their contribution to the
project ought to be. In general, partners wanted a
clearer long-term vision, more updates, and a better
understanding of what would be expected of them.
“Months and months can go by [after the research
submission] before the actual [grant] approval
so, I think it needs to be reiterated at the beginning of the project: ‘Remember this is what we
submitted, and this is what we said. Does this still
make sense? Can you still play the role? Who is
going to be [involved]? Are you still committed?’
All of those pieces.”
In some cases, the perceived lack of project organization left the partners feeling negative.
“Sometimesthematerialswouldbesentthemorning of a meeting or the day before which did not
really offer a lot of time to review and to be able
to provide useful input. Sometimes that comes
across as, ‘Okay, we are working on this and we
do not really want your input but here it is.’ And I
know that is likely not the case but that is certainly
how it can be perceived.”
For the most part, the partners contributed in ways
that aligned with their expertise or with their role in
their respective organizations. None of the interviewees expressed a need to contribute to aspects of the
project that were beyond their area of expertise.
“Well, I think it’s very nice to partner with organizations who will stick to their scope . . . . Having
people perform different roles in a partnership is
the way it should be and it’s nice to be able to
collaborate and share but having clearly deﬁned,
‘This is what we’re going to do and this is what
we would like to do,’ is I think the best-case
scenario.”
“I felt like I was involved enough. Not that I didn’t
enjoy it, but again my role is very functional. So
in terms of being more involved in any of the
research, it wouldn’t necessarily ﬁt in to my role.”
Although some of the partners found the changes
in research direction that took place during the study
frustrating, many of them appreciated that the project
needed more ﬂexibility as it progressed.
“I thought we would be putting together a work
plan, working towards something, but there never
really was a formal plan . . . . I’ve seen the value
of being able to use this data in many ways . . . .
I’ve actually really liked the way it’s gone and the
ﬂexibility that it’s provided in terms of its application to many different facets of the work that
we do. So, on the one hand we can used it to help
advance policy, [but] we can also use it to secure
corporate partnership.”
4.1.3. Right partners involved
A strong theme was the importance of inviting
the right people to be part of the project team. This
included people whose mandates allowed them to
fully contribute to the project, as well as senior
decision-makers with the authority to focus their
organization on the research, and support sustainability. There were a few instances where interviewees
felt that the wrong person from the organization had
been included in the project, and that this had affected
the organization’s ability to use the knowledge
effectively.
“One of the keys to success of these types of partnerships is everyone’s mandate and who has the
authority to affect change in that mandate or give
it credence, right? So you did this work but what
was the uptake? What was the outcome?”
In the two projects that did not include government
decision-makers as partners, the value of including
policy decision-makers as part of the research team
was not clear. Some thought it would be better to
only involve government as an IPP once results were
ﬁnalized. Another thought that it would be difﬁcult
to engage a policy maker sufﬁciently without overwhelming them with work.
“I would say [policy makers] were probably missing but were they needed? . . . They can say so

much . . . but the broader priorities of the organization take precedence over what they might
say . . . . Also, how do we want to present it
to government? . . . We can be engaging with
bureaucrats but we can also engage with the
elected ofﬁcials and sometimes there are other
means of getting policy changes.”
The importance of having a continuity of individuals as part of the team was also highlighted. One IPP
organization experienced a high level of turnover in
the key position that was meant to link the researchers
withthepractitionersintheirorganization.Duringthe
study, there had been at least four people delegated to
fulﬁl this role. This contributed to reduced continuity
in the project from the partners’ viewpoint.
“There’s a lot of turnover happening in the NGO
sector . . . . Who maintains that relationship, that
contact? How do you transfer projects when
somebody leaves? If that position is not being
replaced immediately, when that person leaves,
how are they transferring that project onto somebody else?”
4.1.4. Relationship with the project leaders
Many of the partners had worked with the
researchers in the past. In a few cases, the pre-existing
relationship helped the organizations make the decision to sign on as a partner.
“Going into [the project] we pretty much had
established the relationship in my view. I was very
familiar with your work, with the type of people
that you were, your passion for it . . . . Of course
we’re going to at every opportunity partner with
you guys.”
Partners spoke about the project leadership’s openness to everyone’s ideas and input.
“[The project lead] is very open-minded, very
friendly, very easy to engage with. S/he’s responsive and respectful. That’s important in providing
the kind of leadership s/he has to provide. At the
same time, s/he’s not a doormat . . . . S/he has
[their] beliefs in how things need to move forward
and has the evidence to back it up. So you respect
what s/he’s coming forward with. And if s/he
doesn’t agree with a position s/he’s comfortable
saying that and why. So it’s been a nice balance.”
Partners also thought that the project leaders were
credible, based on their previous research experience
or the organizations from which they came.
“[They’re] not there working for industry.
[They’re] independent, really. And where do you
ﬁnd that? You don’t . . . . You can’t ﬁnd that anywhere. So yeah, we would latch on . . . . I’m a big
fan.”
There were a few comments about how the leadership could be improved, such as more clearly deﬁning
who the leader was, and better delegation of staff
working on the project.
“Sometimes it felt as though [the project lead]
might not have been trusting or as aware or
maybe just as regularly informed by [their] staff.
So, there were those instances when we felt like,
‘Oh, how did you not know that we were doing
this?’ Or, ‘Why are you asking these questions
now?’ . . . . It was a little confusing at times to
have to wonder, ‘Okay, so who is leading it and
what do they know and what don’t they know?”’
4.1.5. Mutual respect
Many partners acknowledged that mutual respect
is important for a successful partnership.
“I would say some of the keys to a good partnership are to be able to communicate and to be
able to understand each other’s point of view and
respecting each person’s unique differences but
also knowing when to leverage their strengths.”
Largely the partners felt respected and that their
input had been valued throughout the project.
“I’d say the working committee’s been very inclusive in their approach. They’ve always wanted to
listen to people’s perspectives. I wouldn’t say I’ve
felt any level of detachment at any point in the
project.”
However, some of the partners in one project felt
that their input was not being valued and used as much
as it should have been, especially during the initial
stages of the project.
“In the beginning it was a little rough. I won’t
lie . . . . We were isolated, and they kept forgetting about us . . . . They would have calls . . . and
they’d be talking about all this stuff; we’d go,
‘When did that happen, who decided that, no one
askedusaboutthis!’Andtheywerelike,‘Ohyeah,
we had a meeting yesterday in our ofﬁce,’ or ‘We
went for coffee,’ or ‘We had lunch.’ And it was
like, ‘Oh’ . . . . Initially we were so pissed off! Like
they didn’t ask us our opinion and we have opin-

271
ions. They decided this and didn’t ask us about
anything!”
Respect for the other’s knowledge and expertise
extended to gratitude for being able to beneﬁt from
the specialized knowledge and skill that each partner
brought to the table. Partners also knew their own
specialized skill set and what they were able to bring
to the table.
“When I met [the project lead] . . . he gave us an
overview of the project, and I expressed interest.
Could we tap into it? Both from the angle of being
involved in the project and contributing to it but
also being able to utilize the resources? . . . The
work being done by the group, that’s been a great
boon to us because they did all that review stuff
that we normally do on our side. It just allows
us to be lazy basically! In a really good way . . . .
The stuff that’s been developed is great stuff. We
can tap into that and utilize that.”
A signiﬁcant enabler that emerged was the need for
mutual respect for the different ways that practitioners go about their day-to-day business in comparison
toresearchers.Thisledtosomedifﬁcultieswithalignment of the partners and the researchers, especially
at the beginning of the partnerships. For example:
“It is more like oil and water. It can exist in the
same bucket but you never fully integrate.
“There was deﬁnitely a bit of a bump, bumping
along you know, when you realized that you don’t
share a lot of the same vocabulary and you don’t
share a lot of the same working priorities and all
those kind of things”
The partners gave many examples of the differences between the research world and the practice
world. For example, those who had a marketing focus
wished the research ﬁndings would be presented
in simpliﬁed language to make communication and
advocacy easier and more effective.
“In practice, we are only skimming the surface . . . . It is great that there is a lot more depth
to the information but what we need is only this
[top layer] . . . . The depth probably is meaningful to other researchers or future research but as
far as in the practice, we just need the top-level
information.”
Some mentioned the difference in work speed
between researchers and practitioners; practitioners
highlighted
that
research
moved
slower
than
practice.
“It was funny because when the project was going
on, oftentimes the researchers would say, ‘Yeah,
yeah, we’ll have a number by say, June’, and some
of our research colleagues here . . . would laugh
and say, “There is no way it’s going to be done
by June, it’s going to be done months later than
that!” And they were right, every time.”
Despite these inherent differences, many thought
that those from each world could still work together.
The partners were used to different ways of working and to different types of expertise. For example,
within the Burden of Occupational Cancer study, estimates of the number of cases of mesothelioma from
asbestos exposure at work turned out to be smaller
than expected, and therefore less compelling. The
partners knew, from their experience in policy advocacy, that they needed to strategize and ﬁnd the best
way to communicate the numbers.
“Research really helps inform what our policy
position would be. But even when you have the
research, you still have the personal story. You
know, the real-life example of it. It’s really important to help when you’re talking to policymakers,
especially... Like when you can bring it to life by
having a real story to say, ‘This is why this is
really important to make this policy change.”’
4.1.6. Communication
Each project experienced challenges with communication. There was always room for more
communicationbetweentheresearchersandthe IPPs.
In the Sun Safety at Work project, the partners were
spread across the country. A big theme in these interviews was the value of the face-to-face meetings in
comparison to the conference calls. Many acknowledged that face-to-face meetings are preferable, but
difﬁcult to fund and organize given the geographical
distance. The partners noted that conference calls also
have their challenges (like missing body language,
facial expressions, or side conversations), but given
those challenges, they worked well.
“Sometimes it’s hard to tell what people are
actually feeling about a thing . . . . I could hear
[people on the phone] saying something but you
kind of get a sense that there’s something else
going on in the room or there’s a facial expression that you can’t pick up on because you’re
not there . . . . I really enjoyed it when we could

---

come together. I always save my really nitty gritty
hard questions for when I’m going to see people
because I ﬁnd it a lot easier to chat things out
and you’re able to read people and see what they
really mean. It’s hard on the phone. I like meeting
in-person a lot better, but it’s just been hard to do
that too often.”
The IPPs on the Burden of Occupational Cancer
project did appreciate the efforts that the principal investigators (PIs) made to maintain strong
communication (they scheduled regular working
breakfasts and lunches together). However, there
were a few miscommunications between the IPPs and
the researchers. There was some confusion regarding
who was supposed to be leading the planning of conferences. Also, the IPPs wished they had received
more regular updates on the process and a clearer
understanding of when the research ﬁndings could
be shared publicly. They were anxious to use the burden estimates for occupational asbestos exposure in
their advocacy work.
“Therewasatimeearlyon[whenwesaid],‘When
can we use these [asbestos] numbers because we
would like to start incorporating them?’ and the
PI was like, ‘Well they’re still not ﬁnal . . . you
have to wait.’ From a research perspective, I
recognize that you need to have these numbers complete and validated. [They were] more
like, ‘We’re showing you these [other] numbers.
Here’s the diesel. Here’s the wood dust. You can
start using these in your work.’ We didn’t have
the appetite or the resource really to take on those
new areas.”
Some of the IPPs on the Completing the Picture
project felt a bit disconnected from the project. However, others felt that the meetings had been adequate
since they did not have the time to meet more frequently.
“By virtue of the partnership I always felt that
we’d be kept on track. So there wasn’t a point
where I was thinking, ‘Oh, we should be meeting more’. Probably because we were juggling
so many different other things. I don’t think it
had occurred to me . . . . If this] had been one
of a lot fewer items that we were working with
maybe I would be thinking, ‘Oh we should have
met more.”’
4.1.7. Shared values & priorities
Finally, a major enabler of the relationship between
researchers and partners was whether they shared a
vision of the importance of the project. The projects
were important to the IPPs because the projects’
mandates fell within their organizations’ priorities,
or because the partners’ stakeholders (workers or
patients) wanted the research to be done, or because
theirstakeholdersvaluedevidence-basedpracticeand
investment in research. Some individual interviewees
stated that their project’s focus went beyond their
organizational mandate and was actually a personal
passion.
“This particular project, it was one that we were
absolutely proud to be a part of and felt that it
was just giving us more capacity. In fact, it was
fulﬁlling our mandate in a very thoughtful way
with very skilled operators. It allowed us to hit
areas we would have liked to be hitting but just
hadn’t gotten to.”
However, in one case, a partner organization was
undergoing structural change and organizational priorities were changing. This became a barrier to the
relationship. These partners did not know whether
the project work would continue because they did
not know whether their mandate would continue to
include occupational cancers.
“It’s a little unclear as to where things will go
in the future because we have undergone such
massive restructuring here with new leadership.
We’ve had this win [with policy change] but
it’s hard to say whether our priorities will stay
focused on that or not because of all the changes
happening. So, I don’t think it’s because of anything related to [the researchers]. I think it’s just
an independent factor that’s happening here that
might inﬂuence moving forward.”
4.2. Outcomes
There were tangible outcomes of the i KT partnerships that were mentioned by the IPPs. The outcomes
that were highlighted included: 1) improved relevance and quality of the research ﬁndings; 2)
enhanced learning about the others’ “world”; 3)
enhanced access to other information and contacts;
4) improved use of research in practice and policy;
5) dissemination and diffusion of the research ﬁndings; 6) development of trust and goodwill; and 7)
continued collaboration on new projects.

273
4.2.1. Relevance/quality of research ﬁndings
The Sun Safety at Work project produced many
communication tools outside of traditional research
papers,
such
as
workplace-focused
sun
safety
resources, a project website, and presentations for
workplaces and industry. The IPPs were involved in
developing these and were proud of them.
“It’s incredible how much work is being pumped
out in the time that I’ve been on the project. That
always amazes me how much a small group is
capable of . . . [I’m] looking forward to the ﬁnal
result of the website. It will be great to see something from the very beginning idea through to
fruition.”
The Burden of Occupational Cancer could have
been overwhelmed by the number of exposures and
the number of cancers to include in the research, but
the IPPs were able to limit both so that the results of
the study would be relevant to their membership as
well as to policy-makers.
“There was a big list of carcinogens to take a look
at so we had to help reduce that list to a more
workable list and one that would make sense in
terms of our prevention exercises, initiatives, and
public policy or advocacy initiatives”
4.2.2. Learning about the other’s “world”
The partners appreciated learning about the
research content area and the difﬁculties of achieving workplace change. The IPPs also reported that
they had expanded their knowledge about occupational health and safety, occupational cancer, and the
ﬁeld of knowledge translation.
“I learned more about occupational cancers and
the types of carcinogens that are frequent within
the workplace as well as the number of people
exposed to them and the types of cancers they can
lead to and the whole process of how we ﬁgure
that out... I have learned a lot about occupational
cancers and it’s really opened up my eyes to the
research that’s happening in that area.”
Although the majority of the IPPs had worked
with researchers before (or had a research background themselves), many said they still learned
something new from partnering on their research
project. The process of partnering taught the IPPs
about researchers’ work style, as well as the limitations and constraints that researchers face.
“Actually, I think [partnering on this research
project] improved our relationship because we
understood sort of what was involved in the process, how it can be cumbersome to get access to
data, sometimes the data was not enough —those
sorts of things. I think it really, probably created
greater respect for the work that researchers do.”
They also felt the learning had been a two-way
street, and that the researchers had also learned what
the partners needed.
“We both learned from each other, I think there
was a lot of back and forth, you know, a lot of
give and take, understanding what we need, what
they need . . . . I think [the researchers] probably
learned how simpliﬁed we may need things to be!
So, we might have this great, very detailed, comprehensive backgrounder or summary and then
we would take it to three facts [laughs], and have
[the bigger document] in the background.”
4.2.3. Access to other information/contacts
The Sun Safety at Work project was the only
project that brought together partners from organizations across Canada. These partners were thankful
for the opportunity to network with and learn from
each other. They planned to leverage those contacts
again in the future. Further, this networking allowed
partners in British Columbia and Nova Scotia to build
capacity around occupational sun safety.
“Obviously we loved the whole aspect of having
a Canada-wide initiative. But [we] also realized
if we’re going to do something provincially we
want to try and set up something here where we
can partner with people.”
4.2.4. Use of research in practice/policy
It is often difﬁcult to directly link research results
to a policy initiative [23–25] since policy and advocacy work happens within a larger system with
multifaceted and interacting forces. However, the
partners felt that the projects had played a positive
role in the ultimate outcome of certain advocacy
and policy work. An example from each project
follows.
One of the project partners of the Sun Safety at
Work project worked for Work Safe BC, the British
Columbia provincial governmental body responsible for both the implementation and enforcement of
occupational health and safety legislation. Through

---

E. Haynes et al. / Research with intermediary practice partners
this partner’s involvement in the project, WorkSafe BC integrated sun safety into their occupational
disease strategy for 2016–2018.
The ﬁndings from the Completing the Picture indicated signiﬁcant challenges with incorporating work
exposure screening into the daily practice of primary healthcare. One of the project’s partners, the
Occupational Health Clinics for Ontario Workers,
has been leading a provincial Ministry of Labour
initiative on preventing occupational disease. The initiative’s Occupational Disease Action Plan has a goal
to: “Develop a strategy to embed ‘Occupation’ and
potentially other links to work into [patients’] Electronic Medical Record (EMR)” [26]. This goal may
be shelved or adapted at least partially as a result of
the project’s ﬁndings.
Thirdly, there is also some evidence that the Burden of Occupational Cancer project’s estimates have
been useful in policy change. Estimates of the burden of mesothelioma and lung cancer resulting from
occupationalasbestosexposurewereleveragedbythe
project’s partner and the media to support a campaign
for a national ban on the use of asbestos. In December 2015, the Canadian government announced that it
would ban the sale of asbestos by 2018 (Grant, 2016).
As one of the partners said:
“Wedidhavesomesuccess.Theasbestosnumbers
have helped to bring about policy change at the
national level . . . . I would say having that big win
at the national level in terms of asbestos was a
big accomplishment and the Burden grant helped
to push that forward. I mean there was a lot of
momentum.Iwouldn’tsayitwas,youknow,solely
because of that, but I think it helped push the
evidence forward to the federal government that
change needed to happen.”
4.2.5. Dissemination/diffusion of research
At the time of the interviews, the Sun Safety at
Work Canada and the Burden of Occupational Cancer
had produced research results. Partners from both of
these projects reported that their organizations had
disseminated the research results during the course
of the study. As part of the required reporting for its
funder, the Sun Safety at Work Canada project team
tracked its stakeholder engagement activities. Table 2
shows a breakdown of these activities.
Dissemination of the results from the Burden
of Occupational Cancer project focused on policy
change that would be led by the partner/funder organization. As mentioned, the ﬁndings were used by
the CCS to advocate for a ban on asbestos use in
Canada. They also used the radon estimates to advocate for radon testing. Employees from other regions
of CCS (i.e., other provinces) were ﬂown to Toronto
twice for meetings on the preliminary Burden study
results. Additionally, four conferences were organized to spread the emerging ﬁndings from the study
to relevant stakeholders (health and safety advocates, industry, organized labour, practitioners, and
other researchers). Findings have been presented at
numerous conferences, have been discussed at many
stakeholder meetings, and have been reported in the
media.
The project partners on these two projects reported
that they continued to disseminate ﬁndings after
the project’s funding ended, although it has been
difﬁcult to maintain good metrics on these dissemination/diffusion activities.
4.2.6. Development of trust and goodwill
Almost all the partners directly said that they had a
positive experience being part of the research project
and that their relationships with the researchers had
developed and grown.
“It did feel like a partnership. I was always happy
to say this is who we work with and this is what
we do and how we’re doing it, and we’re funding
part of this and it’s great. So I think it was a
positive relationship experience, and relationship
building experience.”
However, not all the relationships had the same
positive level of progression. In the Sun Safety at
Work Canada project, the researchers were mostly
based in Ontario. The IPPs felt that the researchers
had closer relationships with the IPPs based in
Ontario than with IPPs located in the other provinces.
Due to the geographical distance, fewer in-person
meetings, and less opportunities to work together on
all of the different aspects of the project, the IPPs
in British Columbia, Nova Scotia and Alberta found
the relationship with researchers more difﬁcult to
develop.
“[Partnering] helped develop the relationships. It
deepened other relationships that pre-existed but
it was really the local ones where we were seeing each other . . . the relationships were growing
because of the project but also because we were
seeing each other. So, the folks out west and the
folks out east were names and they were voices
but I don’t have a sense that I really have a rela-

4.2.7. Continued collaboration on new projects
The IPPs agreed that, if the chance arose, they
would partner again with the researchers. In some
cases, it was clear that the relationship between the
twoparties(researchersand IPPs)wasadrivingfactor
in this openness to continue to collaborate.
“There are some established relationships and
friendships that have emerged that are really
going to be longstanding. So [there’s] the opportunity to continue to move this work forward and
to have people to go to with questions or to mobilize people across the country. I think there is a
bit of a foundation that’s been started . . . . I don’t
think [these relationships are] going to go away.
And if there are opportunities for additional work,
collaborative work, I hope we’ll be able to rally
the troops again.”
A few said that future partnerships would depend
on what the research project was and what their
organization’s priorities were and whether the two
aligned. These comments were likely inﬂuenced by
the fact that their organizations were undergoing signiﬁcant change. As these IPPs said, it was unclear
what their organization’s priorities would be in the
future.
“It’s going to take that alignment of sort of [our]
priorities and the opportunity that would [be]
presented. So at the moment, we’re undergoing
a massive amount of change. Our priorities are
changing and in ﬂux.”
5. Discussion
From the perspective of researchers seeking partners for a research project, this study aimed to
understand the elements of the i KT collaborative
partnership of researchers and knowledge users (our
IPPs) that could predict success. The study considered indicators of a successful partnership as
both an improved spread or use of knowledge in
practice or for policy change, and as positive outcomes from the partnership such as trust and lessons
learned. From these results, the researchers now
propose four suggestions for how i KT partnerships
should be structured to set them on the path for
success.
5.1. Negotiating aspects of engagement
The Canadian Institutes for Health Research says
that ideally, a collaborative i KT research study,
should include the knowledge users in every aspect of
the research process: 1) research question generation;
2) selection of methodology; 3) the intervention and
implementation; 4) data collection; 5) data analysis
and interpretation; 6) writing manuscripts; and 7) dissemination/diffusion [1]. However, the three projects
in this study did not include the partners in all stages
of the research process. Boundaries were set at the
outset by the researchers, and these boundaries were
never challenged by the IPPs. Overall, the IPPs were
happy with the scope and level of their involvement.
Although perhaps not an explicit reason for setting
these boundaries at the projects’ outsets, it may have
been that the IPPs believed that they lacked the requisite expertise to engage in all aspects of the research

---


### Page 16

276
E. Haynes et al. / Research with intermediary practice partners
process. For example, the skills possessed by epidemiologists that enable them to select and adapt a
methodology for estimating the social and economic
burden of occupational cancer, and then carry out the
analysis, is not a skill set that practitioners necessarily
have, nor is it one that is easily taught.
Although full involvement in these very technical and specialized decisions might not be feasible,
a level of involvement in the choice of methodology and data analysis is still possible. For example,
formative qualitative ﬁndings could be shared with
practitioners with relative ease, and the practitioners’
contribution to the interpretation of the meaning of
these results would be valuable. However, what we
heard from the IPPs on all three projects was that
these tasks were outside their scope of practice both
personally and in their organizational role. Partners
thought it would be beneﬁcial to learn these skills,
but it was not feasible given all their other priorities
outside of the project.
Thus, in these three i KT projects, there was a
balance between inclusion and practicality. The partners were welcome to be a part of the full research
process, but it was understood that sometimes they
would select activities where they thought their
expertise would be most valuable. For example, the
partners were more willing to help with identifying major elements in existing sun-safety materials,
writing, editing, or contributing to plain-language
communications, engaging their network to recruit
workplaces and then later disseminate ﬁndings, and
helping to give presentations to workplaces on occupational health and safety or occupational disease
issues.
Recommendation: Researchers and knowledge
users should spend time at the beginning of a
project partnership outlining their expectations
of their roles and involvement. There should be a
discussion about making contributions in aspects
that are outside of their realms of expertise, and
the beneﬁts that such an involvement could bring
(i.e. a chance to build capacity and provide input
on the results).
5.2. Investing time in the project
One of the biggest barriers that the IPPs encountered regarding their full participation within the
research process was time. Research is the primary
focus for the researchers, but it is not for the knowledge users. All of the IPPs mentioned they felt they
were restrained in their ability to fully participate in
their project (or hire someone who could). Despite
this, many were still able to participate regularly on
their projects. For others, the timing of the project
was unfortunately not auspicious. In these cases, the
IPPs were in organizations that were undergoing disruptive internal change that precluded them focusing
fully on the study.
Recommendation: When considering intermediary organizations to engage as partners, consider
these questions: Is this the right time for the
organization to invest their time and resources
in an i KT partnership? Do they have the time and
resources available?
5.3. Role demands
Higher-level decision makers generally have
greater demands on their time, and therefore might
be less able to dedicate adequate time to an external
research project. Thus, available time and resources
might affect which person the organization delegates
as the key liaison with the project. However, it is
important to consider the role and decision-making
power of the individual chosen from the organization and whether their responsibilities align with the
role that the project needs them to ﬁll. If the goal
of including a speciﬁc organization is to have them
make signiﬁcant changes within their organization or
to advocate for change externally, then it is important
to have a higher-level decision-maker on the team.
However, if the purpose of engaging a particular organization is to harness a skill or technical ability, then
a different type of employee should be targeted as the
representative partner.
Recommendation: Consider the role the partner organization is to play on the project, and
approach someone within the organization with
an appropriate mandate to be the partner.
5.4. Partners who believe in the project
One of the research projects was attempting to
address a problem that some of the IPPs thought was
nearly impossible to address. The project’s goal—to
ﬁnd a way to systematically collect information on
workplace exposures—was meant to help ﬁnd a solution to a problem that the partner organization(s) had
grappled with in their work. Although this research
project was extremely relevant to the intermediary
organization(s), some of the partners thought the

---


### Page 17

E. Haynes et al. / Research with intermediary practice partners
277
study’s goal had been tried before and failed, and
hence was likely to fail again. Although they thought
the goal was desirable, they struggled to buy into
the project because they did not believe that it could
achieve results. They were doubtful that the problem
would or could ever be solved. Thus, their commitment to the research process was conﬂicted.
Recommendation:
When
considering
which
organizations to engage as partners, consider
these questions: Even if the partners are willing
to engage in the project, do they have the commitment to the project? By this we mean, how
dedicated will the partners be to the project? How
involved do they want to be? Do they think their
investment of time and resources will reap proportional beneﬁts? Do they think the goals of the
project are achievable?
6. Limitations
This evaluation of the three researcher-IPPs collaborative partnerships has limitations. Only the
perspective of the IPPs is represented and not that
of the researchers. The researchers wanted to learn
more about i KT research partnerships with the hope
of improving their approach to project partnerships
in the future and contributing to the literature on
i KT. The researchers wanted to interview the IPPs
about their experience in the partnership—what
worked well, and their suggestions for improvement.
However, when this idea was ﬁrst proposed at the
initiation of one of the studies, the newly-recruited
IPPs were reluctant. Although it was eventually
decided amongst the researchers and the IPPs that
this partnership evaluation and the interviews would
go forward, some of the initial hesitancy was still
present.
Some of the IPPs’ reluctance to have researchers
interview them may be because it could challenge the
equality in the partnership between the researchers
and IPPs. Equality is an important part of i KT
partnerships. While the researchers followed the necessary ethical procedures and ensured that each of
the interviewees’ views would be kept conﬁdential,
the proposal to interview the IPPs tested the established trust between the researchers and the IPPs.
Although the researchers feel conﬁdent that this trust
was never broken and has actually grown through the
process of partnering, this initial concern is important
to mention.
Social desirability bias was also a concern in this
study. The researchers wondered if the interviewees
might feel obligated to respond more positively than
they actually felt. All but two of the interviews were
completed by EH, who reports to DMK. (DMK completed the remaining two). DMK was a main research
partner on all three of the projects and has professional relationships with the partners. Although the
participants interviewed by EH were assured that
neither the recordings nor the transcripts would be
shared with DMK, the researchers suspect that interview responses were skewed to the positive. One
of the research authors on this manuscript, based
upon her experience working on one of the projects,
was surprised that the responses were not more
negative.
7. Conclusion
IKT partnerships are considered by many to be
an important and effective method for translating
research to practice. However, few have evaluated
such partnerships to understand what factors predict success or failure. This study looked at three
i KT partnerships to understand what worked and
did not work. This study builds upon a summary
of i KT approaches, inﬂuencing factors, and outcomes outlined by Gagliardi et al. (2016), and on
a previous study that the authors conducted on a
researcher-intermediary partnership. The study offers
recommendations for those who might be considering taking an i KT approach to their research. In
conclusion, the study found that i KT partnerships
canachievenotableknowledgeuseanddissemination
outcomes, can build valuable relationships between
the researchers and practitioners, and these strong
relationships can be harnessed for future research
collaborations.
