health effect, including death, amputation, 
burn, crush, blast, blindness, hearing loss 
and brain injury, is unnecessary. Engineering, scientific, and 
record-keeping experience over the last t en years has shown 
that electrical incidents are not random or rare. Safety professionals and electrical safety leaders are uniquely positioned to respond to every unintentional workplace exposure

safe electrical work practices, we present a hiscorical 
overview of electrification and electrical safety management, followed by a survey of recent developments to 
reduce the frequency and severity of electrical incidents 
and their consequences. In the worlds of business, manufacturing, engineering, behavioral safety, and regulacory 
compliance, the financial case for improving electrical 
safety can be justified through measurable improvement 
by preventing injury co people, minimizing energy and 
raw materials waste, preventing process safety and environmental incidents, protecting capital investment from 
damage, and increasing uptime of operations. 
Beginning in the last decade of the 19th century and 
escalating rapidly during the first quarter of the 20th century, virtually every facet of our civilization integrated 
electrical applications. Through the 20th century, electrification became the single most important engineering 
achievement, according to the U.S. National Academy of 
Engineering. Power generation and distribution·, communication, mass transportation, agriculture and food production, and diag nostic medicine are examples of the 
domains chat were transformed by electrification. Ocher 
significant engineering accomplishments of che past century, such as space travel and aucomobiles, were dependent 
on electrical technologies. 
It is difficult co imagine life without the conveniences of electricity. However, the electrification of all 
aspects of society has had the negative attribute of 
exposing people to potential injury and property loss 
from electrical hazards. 
Dramatic inventions and more uses in electrical technology have come at the expense of many lives and limbs. 
The most common hazards associated with electrical energy include: 
Fire: The National Electrical Code was originally 
developed because of this hazard. 
Converted Energy: Electricity in ics raw form has little 
use co us. We muse convert electricity inco a form 
we can use such light, heat, or magnetic forces co 
drive motors, which present potential hazads. 
Shock: The hazard we most hear about, but not everyone understands or appreciates this hazard as much 
as they should. 
Electrochemical Hazards: The chemicals used in batteries are hazardous. 
Flash Burn and Blast: The hazards from the intense 
thermal, acoustic, blast, light, and electromagnetic 
energy release in an electric arc. 
The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety 
and Health has consistently reported electrocution as one 
of the cop five leading causes of occupational fatalities. 
Bureau of Labor Statistics data for 1994 show 11,153 cases 
of reported days away from work due co electrical burns, 
electrocution/electrical shock injuries, and fires and explosions. In 1994, the Census of Fatal Injuries noted 548 
employees died from the causes of electrical current exposure, fires, and explosions out of a coral 6,588 work-related 
faralities nationwide. Electrocution is the second most 
common cause of construction-related fatality. In the U.S. 
chemical industry, 56% fatalities over a five-year period 
were attributable to burns, fires, and explosions. Many 
times the ignition source for these events was related co an 
electrical activity. In practical terms, the data means there 
are roughly two deaths from electrical hazards each day. 
With regard co electricians, according co the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics (U.S. Department of Labor, 25 January 
2001), between 1993-1998, there were 101,884 reported 
nonfatal occupational injuries and illnesses in U.S. private 
industry. These numbers do not capture consumer related 
or recreational electrical incidents or incidents affecting 
workers who are not electricians. 
Hiscorically, interest in technology, the invention of 
machines co solve problems and meet specific needs, has 
outpaced our ability co safeguard lives and the environment from electrical hazard exposures. However, as hazard 
recognition has escalated, leadership has emerged co champion safe electricity use. If the progress in electrical safety 
during the past century was a journey, the work spanning 
the past ten years has been a sprint. Advancing codes, 
standards, information and management technology, and 
work practices critical for improving electrical safety in 
industrial work environments have created the expertise 
and strategies co further eliminate electrical incident 
occurrences. 
Evolution in Standards and Regulations 
In the United States, there are a number of standards and 
regulations related co electrical safety. They cover both 
electrically safe equipment conditions and electrical safety-related work practices. 
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
(OSHA) Regulations (Scandards29 CFR) are federal 
law and must be followed under penalty of fines and/or 
imprisonment. Part 1910, Occupational Safety and Health 
Standards, applies co general industry. Subpart S, 
1910.3 31 through 1910. 3 3 5, Electrical Safety-Related 
Work Practices, and Subpart R, 1910.269, Electric Power 
Generation, Transmission, and Distribution, contain regulations chat dictate safe electrical work practices. Ocher 
OSHA standards directly related to electrical safety 
include 1910, Subpart I, Personal Protective Equipment; 
1910, Subpart J, General Environmental Controls; 
1910.147, The Control of Hazardous Energy; 1910, Subpart 
S, Electrical. Pare 1926, Safety and Health Regulations for 
Construction, applies co the construction industry. Standards in chis Part include; Subpart K, Electrical, and Subpart V, Power Transmission and Distribution. 
The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 
has been involved with electrical safety for almost a 
century. Today the NFPA publishes s tandards covering 
both safe electrical installations and safe electrical work 
practices, including: 
NFPA 70, The National Electrical Code (NEC), contains provisions chat are necessary for electrically safe 
installations within or on public and private buildings or structures. le does not cover safe work 
practices. 
NFPA 70E, Standard for Electrical Safety Requirements 
for Employee Workplaces, addresses the safety aspects of 
both conditions and activities chat apply for an 
employee to work safely in an electrical environment. In the 1995 and 2000 editions, chis standard

took giant leaps forward in providing guidance for 
personnel protection from the arc-flash hazard. 
Ocher NFPA standards chat contain information relative co electrical safety include NFPA 70B, Recommended Practice for Electrical Equipment Maintenance, 
and NFPA 79, Electrical Standard for Industrial 
Machinery. 
The IEEE publishes many documents covering the 
design of safe and reliable electrical facilities and equipment. Standards specifically addressing electrical safety 
include: 
ANSI C2, National Electrical Safety Code (NESC), 
covers basic provisions for the safeguarding of persons from hazards arising from the inscallacion, 
operation, or maintenance of conductors and 
equipment in electric supply stations and overhead and underground electric supply and communications lines. It also includes work rules for 
the safe construction, maintenance, and operation 
of electric supply and communication lines and 
equipment. 
IEEE 902 (The IEEE Yellow Book), Guide for Maintenance, Operation and Safety of Industrial and Commercial 
Power Systems, provides guidelines for operating 
industrial and commercial electric power facilities. 
It contains six chapters devoted specifically co electrical safety. 
IEEE 1584, Guide for Performing Arc-Flash Hazard 
Calculations, provides techniques for designers and 
facility operacors co apply in determining the arcflash hazard distance and the incident energy co 
which employees could be exposed during their 
work on or near electrical equipment. 
The American Society for Testing and Materials 
(ASTM) standards cover such things as protective rubber 
goods, temporary protective grounds, plastic guards, insulated tools, and ocher electrical protective equipment. Several relatively new standards measure or identify thermal 
performance of materials and protective clothing for use 
by workers who may be exposed co thermal hazards from 
electric arcs. These include: 
ASTM Fl 506, Standard Performance Specification for 
Textile Materials for Wearing Apparel for Use by Electrical Workers Exposed to Momentary Electric Arc and 
Related Thermal Hazards. 
ASTM Fl 958, Standard Test Method for Determining 
the lgnitability of Non-flame-Resistance Materials for 
Clothing by Electric Arc Exposure Method Using Mannequins. This method is used co measure the arc 
exposure energy level chat will cause uncreated cotcon fabrics or ocher flammable caching materials co 
ignite. 
ASTM Fl 959, Standard Test Method for Determining 
the Arc Thermal Performance Value of Materials for 
Clothing. This test method will measure the arc thermal performance value (ATPV) of materials in calories per centimeter. 
ASTM F2178, Standard Test Method for Determining 
the Arc Rating of Face Protective Products. This test 
method is used co measure the arc racing of face 
shields and hoods. 
Electrical Safety Technology 
In addition co an accelerated pace in the development of 
electrical safety related standards, new technologies and 
attributes of existing technologies have been brought co 
the forefront co further reduce hazards in the home and 
workplace. These technologies include: 
the ground fault circuit interrupter, credited for 
reducing residential electrocutions by 50% since 
first introduced in the lace 1960s 
the arc fault circuit interrupter, designed co detect 
arcing faults chat are attributed co causing more 
than 40,000 residential and commercial fires annually in the United States 
high-resistance grounding for low voltage power distribution systems enhances reliability and uptime of 
power distribution equipment and is proven effective in significantly reducing the frequency and 
severity of arc flash accidents 
arc-resistant switchgear, a technology chat protects 
personnel from exposure co electric arc flash and 
blast injury by directing and venting the explosive 
and thermal hazards away from personnel 
current limiting fuses and circuit breakers, based on 
technologies chat detect and disconnect power co 
short circuits within 1/120 s, contributes co personnel protection by significantly reducing incident 
energy in arc flash accidents 
couch-safe technology limits finger access co exposed terminals and energized pares by sufficiently 
recessing the terminal or energized part such chat it 
can be contacted by a test instrument or cool, but 
not by a human finger 
fiber optic and ocher data highway technologies provide opportunities co reduce shock exposure by 
using nonlethal light or safe low voltages for control 
and measurement circuits. 
Emergence of Electric Arc Flash 
as a Unique Electrical Hazard 
Historically, electrical hazards were viewed as primarily 
electric shock or electrocution hazards. While the electric 
shock hazard is certainly important, it has masked a second important and unique electrical hazard associated 
with the incense radiant and convective energy released 
during an electric arc flash event. In some cases, the presence of multiple exposure conditions in an electrical incident (i.e., shock, radiation, heat transfer) makes it difficult 
co determine which hazard is responsible for fatal and nonfatal injuries. Burn injury may be sustained even in the 
absence of an exposure co electrical shock from the radiant 
and convective energy released in an electric arc event. 
Ralph Lee first reported in 1982 on chis non-contact electrical hazard in his paper, "Ocher Electrical Hazard: Electric Arc Blase Burns." It has taken the intervening two 
decades co quantify the arc exposure energy, determine the 
protective performance of clothing, and develop work 
practices and protective clothing guidelines for dealing 
with chis hazard. Recognizing chat electrical contact 
avoidance is not sufficient co protect against injury and 
death, a new electrical safety approach evolved. Recent 
work has addressed how to integrate protective strategies

for electric shock and electric arc exposures into an electrical safety management process. The 2000 edition of NFPA 
70E was the first comprehensive approach to deal with 
both the electric shock hazard and the noncontact arc 
exposure hazard. 
A significant number of second- and third-degree 
injuries result from the intense radiant and convective 
energy of an electric arc. These injuries can frequently 
occur without electrical contact with the burn victim. The 
most serious of these burn injuries involve the ignition of 
the victim's clothing by the arc exposure. The relatively 
long time, e.g., 30-60 s of continued burning of conventional work clothing, increases both the burn depth and 
the total body area suffering burn injury. This directly 
affects trauma severity and survivability. The total area of 
body burn injury is a key survival factor for burn victims 
based on the 1991-1993 American Burn Association 
study, along with inhalation injury. Flame-resistant (FR) 
clothing can significantly reduce burn injury resulting 
from electric arc exposure first by minimizing or avoiding 
clothing ignition and second by creating a thermal barrier, 
which reduces the arc exposure energy reaching the victim's body surface. Consequently, over the past decade, 
there has been increased emphasis by OSHA and the 
ASTM and NFPA standards organizations on the use of FR 
clothing by workers exposed to the electric arc flash hazard. 
Electric arc exposure intensity is typically more severe 
than flame exposure. Consequently, there is a high proba- , 
bility that an arc exposure will be sufficient to ignite conventional work clothing. Conventional work clothing is 
typically made of 100% cotton fabrics or fabrics made of a 
polyester/cotton fiber blends or a nylon/cotton fiber blend. 
All of these fabric types are flammable, and in addition, 
the nylon and polyester fibers can melt into the skin causing a more serious burn injury. Fabrics containing polyester and nylon should be avoided due to this melting 
hazard. The ASTM F1958 test method can be used to 
determine the arc exposure incident energy that will 
ignite conventional work clothing. The incident energy 
required for ignition increases as would be expected with 
fabric weight. Darker colors tend to ignite at lower incident energy levels than lighter colors. The primary point 
on ignition is that all conventional work clothing fabrics 
can ignite, will continue to burn on the wearer's body and 
will cause more severe burn injury to greater areas of the 
body. If clothing is ignited, burn injury can quickly spread 
to areas of the body that were not exposed in the electric 
arc flash accident. 
The primary benefit of FR clothing is that it will self 
extinguish upon ignition, usually within a few seconds. 
Consequently, FR clothing will not add to the burn injury 
by continuing to burn on the wearer's body like conventional work clothing. In addition, each layer of FR clothing also provides a thermal barrier which can be designed 
to reduce or minimize bum injury for skin under the FR 
clothing single- or multiple-layer system. The ASTM 
Fl959 Test Method is used to quantify the thermal performance of single and multiple layers of FR fabrics or coated 
materials. This method exposes FR fabric to hear energy 
from an electric arc and measures the ATPV of the fabric. 
Fabric performance is determined from the amount of heat 
energy transmitted by the fabric and the observed effect of 
the electric arc exposure on the fabric. Similarly, ASTM 
F2178 measures the arc rating of face shields and hoods 
used to protect workers from the heat of an arc flash event. 
Incident energy can be estimated for each specific task 
involving an arc hazard, provided the arc exposure parameters can be defined. The workday of an industrial electrician may involve a wide range of arc exposure hazards. 
Some tasks, high current switching for example, may 
involve the potential for very high arc exposure energy for 
the short time required to carry out the cask. Other routine tasks performed by the same worker may involve 
much less severe arc exposure hazards. Thousands of laboratory tests have been conducted per ASTM F1959 and 
F2 l 78 to define the performance of FR fabrics, face 
shields, and hoods used for arc flash personal protective 
equipment (PPE). 
Typically, the large range of potential arc exposures 
within the scope of electrical tasks performed by a group 
of workers requires that a comprehensive task-by-task 
analysis be done. This hazard analysis will provide the predicted exposure needed to determine whether routine electrical tasks require workers to wear FR clothing and which 
specific tasks require more protection, e.g., multilayer FR 
clothing systems. The arc hazard analysis generally consists of three main steps: 
1) estimating the potential incident energy available at 
the work location 
2) evaluation of engineering options 
3) selecting appropriate protective clothing and PPE to 
protect the worker. 
NFPA 70E provides guidance on conducting hazard 
analyses, but this must be combined with a detailed 
analysis of the electrical system parameters where electrical work will be performed. The use of an FR clothing 
system does not preclude the possibility of sustaining a 
burn injury. For more severe arc exposures, additional layers of FR clothing, as well as face and head protection, are 
indicated. Real arc exposures may be more or less severe 
than laboratory arc exposures, due to greater arc movement toward or away from the exposed worker, unknown 
arc length, system reclosure, secondary explosions or fires, 
weather conditions, and a hose of ocher factors. 
Work is underway in other standards and regulations to 
incorporate these advancements in understanding arc flash 
hazards. For the first time, the 2002 edition of the NEC 
required field labeling of certain electrical equipment to 
warn personnel of risks. 
Advances in the Evaluation and 
Treatment of Electrical Injury 
Advances in the evaluation of electrical and thermal 
injuries suggest char the mechanisms of injury in electrical 
trauma can be appreciated as consequences of the multiple 
incident hazards. The clinical spectrum of electrical injury 
ranges from the absence of any external physical signs co 
severe multiple trauma. Reported neuropsychiatric sequelae can vary from vague complaints, which may seem 
unrelated to the injury in their occurrence over time or by 
their apparent severity, to sequelae consistent with brain 
injury accompanying an electrical trauma.

Because of the statistical occurrence and geographic 
distribution of these incidents in the United Scates, rural 
or community-based hospitals may evaluate an electrical 
trauma survivor as infrequently as once a year. When 
major burns are not involved, che nature of che patient's 
presentation may be unimpressive to busy clinicians, compared co ocher mulcicrauma patients who might also be in 
che local emergency setting. The patient's pose-injury neurologic and cognitive status may contribute co the assessment difficulty. To the extent chat the patient is amnescic 
or confused about che details on how they were hurt, clinicians may not be able co elicit faces about the injury scenario chat would be reasonably expected co guide the 
aggressiveness of their diagnostic evaluation. Electrical 
incident survivors tend co be primarily male workers of 
relatively young age. While the frequency of trauma is low 
(relative co back injury for example), the challenges in 
rehabilitation suggest a high social cost. 
The nature of electrical work, as well as most industrial 
and construction activities, can be characterized generally 
as requiring secure and reliable use of the extremities bilaterally. When an electrical incident occurs with a worker 
present, typically the worker has been engaged in an activity chat relies on their extremities (such as in a reaching 
action in the use of a hand cool or in the hands couching a 
surface in an inspection activity). This explains the frequent 
involvement of at lease one extremity in an injury event, 
and the basis of the disability chat may be experienced with 
peripheral neuropachy symptoms: when a patient has difficulty in their use of their limbs, their security in completing casks (like exerting a forceful grip, climbing a ladder, 
using two hands to life a load, assisting a coworker in a hazardous activity) may be unacceptably compromised. 
Complaints commonly described in electrical injury 
survivors including weakness, pain, headache, memory 
changes, disorientation, slowing of mental processes, agitation, confusion, irritability, affective disorders, and posccraumacic stress disorders. Patients require a thorough and 
ongoing assessment by an expert multidisciplinary team 
to optimize their medical, psychosocial and occupational 
status. The key clinical question co address for each 
patient is "What is preventing the patient from being successful in their recovery?" A seriously injured high-voltage 
electrical shock patient can be re-employed following a 
potentially fatal workplace electrical incident, however, 
the rehabilitation period may extend months beyond the 
time of che patient's acute hospitalization and surgical 
management, and may not lead co the return of the 
patient co their pre-injury job. 
When a trauma patient presents acutely for medical 
care after an electrical incident, their diagnostic evaluation 
is recommended to include a comprehensive examination 
of their neurologic condition and neuromuscular function, 
including at lease the determination of the exposure circumstances and the documentation of che physical findings. Depending on the patient's presentation, further 
evaluation may be warranted with radiology and electrophysiology studies. Central nervous system damage is distinguished from peripheral nerve injury as follows. 
In a 20-year survey of a major electrical utility's disability experience with electrical injury and its sequelae, 
Gourbierre and her colleagues reported on 717 sequelae in 
510 electrical injury victims. Sequelae affected 25 % of 
survivors. Sequelae from bums in 63% cases with 5% 
amputations, neuropsychiatric sequelae in 18%, and sense 
organ sequelae in 12% were noted. Previously reported 
amputation rates following electrical injury have ranged 
between 37-65 % . The disability impact of electrical 
injury is disproportionate co the incidence of chis preventable condition, meaning for relatively few injuries 
there is a relatively high frequency of permanent disability. 
For example, by contrast to the above cited amputation 
races, in the U.S. population of persons aged older than 15 
years reporting selected conditions as the cause of their 
disability, 0.7% of the sample noted disability from missing legs, feet, arms, hands or fingers (from Table 2 for the 
period of 1991-1992 presented in che Morbidity and 
Mortality Weekly Report of the U.S. Centers of Disease 
Control and Prevention, 14 October 1994, p . 7 38). 
Because of the relative youth of chose injured in electrical 
accidents and the loss of potential productivity in economic terms, electrical injury carries significant coses for victims, their families, and their employers. 
Electrical arcs occur frequently in che electrical trauma 
setting and can create destructive air pressure waves due to 
the subsecond thermal expansion of air. In survivors of electrical incidents where the likelihood of mechanical electrical 
contact or entrapment in the arc plasma is low, neurologic, 
neuropsychologic and psychiatric symptoms experienced by 
survivors may be the consequences of blast injury from the 
thermo-acoustic effect of the arc blast. However blast trauma may not be readily appreciated in survivor triage 
because of the subsecond time course of these scenarios and 
the absence of significant external wounds. 
Barotrauma leading co brain injury, tissue damage at 
air-fluid boundaries internally (e.g., lungs, ears, bowel), as 
well as concussions from explosion shrapnel may not be 
accompanied by electrical contact sites or burns. In relation 
co electrical .arc events, the energy input can be expected co 
equal the sum of the energy released in its various forms. 
Conceptually chis can be represented in watts as electrical 
power = electrical power out + plasma formation + heat 
flow (including acoustic waves and shock waves) + light 
power (including optical, infrared and ultraviolet). 
The percentage distribution of the forms of energy in 
the output consequent co an electrical arc is variable, 
described by physics and influenced by environmental 
considerations, i.e., geometry, altitude, humidity, geology, 
and meteorologic factors such as ambient pressure, temperature, and winds. Theoretically, the potential for 
bystander injury is directly related co the energy output 
from an electrical arc; however, it is the actual energy 
exposure, i.e. , the energy transferred to the individual, chat 
provokes a biologic effect. Critical in predicting the extent 
of injury after an electrical incident are the quantity and 
form of energy transfer and che biologic characteristics of 
the individual. 
From the perspective of injury research, che classical 
definition of an injury suggested by James Gibson and 
derailed by William Haddon considered char an injury was 
the specific result of a specific type of energy exchange. 
Criscoffel and Gallagher have summarized the modern con-

cept of injury as "commonly defined as the transfer of energy to human tissues in amounts and at rates that damages 
the cellular structure, tissues, blood vessels, and other bodily structures." In electrical incidents, the dose or amount 
of energy transferred to an individual involved in an unintended exposure is a function of the current, time exposed, 
distance from the source, surface area of the body exposed, 
and the material properties of biologic tissues, including 
the conductance, impedance, resistance and absorbance of 
human "biomaterials," i.e., the water, lipids, fats, proteins, 
minerals that constitute the human body. Historically, the 
industrial focus on electrical injury prevention as burn prevention had its basis in the mechanistic view that an electrical injury was caused by current exposure leading to 
heating and resulting in burns. In the 1920s, the medical 
appreciation of electrical current's biologic effects was similar; Dr. Harvey Cushing, in his discussion of electrical 
cautery techniques in neurosurgery in 1928, commented 
that comparatively large amounts of alternating current 
could be passed through tissue without producing any 
physiological effect other than hearing. However, converging medical and engineering research insights on the complexity of electrical events, as well as their consequences, 
have been fundamental to a changing appreciation of the 
physical forces released at the time of an electrical event, as 
noted in the preceding sections. 
Electrical Work Zones, 
Task Creep, and Safe Boundaries 
After more than a decade of regulations emphasizing the 
critical role of lockout/tagout for controlling personnel 
exposure to hazardous electrical energy, a subtle, but complex problem is being recognized. Solutions and intervention strategies based on human faccors engineering are at 
the forefront of opportunities to have significant impact in 
prevention of electrical injuries. Simply stared, investigations of accident scenarios are finding an alarming common thread in a significant number of cases. The common 
thread involves presumably knowledgeable, competent 
personnel making decisions or taking actions that unintentionally move themselves outside the boundary of the 
isolated and de-energized safe working zone. Industrial 
and commercial control equipment and power distribution equipment are complex systems. These complex systems allow for portions to be isolated and de-energized co 
create a safe working condition. However, other portions 
of the system adjacent to, coupled co, in the same room, or 
in the same fenced area may remain energized. While che 
physical limits may appear apparent in cwo dimensional 
documents and drawings, personnel muse use a broad set 
of cognitive skills to transfer the two dimensional image 
into the real world of 3-D, having potential discrepancies 
in signage, audio and visual diversions, personal distractions, and wide variation of internal configurations of 
equipment that from the outside may appear identical. 
The vulnerability for people unintentionally and without recognition to gee outside the boundary of safety zones 
exists in nearly all types of tasks involving electrical hazards. The design of intervention strategies should be based 
on the assumption char expert, knowledgeable, and competent people can and will make judgment decisions, 
based on the information they have available, that could 
cake themselves outside the safe work zone. Considering 
chis assumption, job and cask planning could include 
additional written, verbal, and physical communication 
cools, and additional emphasis on volcage resting. Examples include physical walk through of a job, in addition co 
review of written job plans; temporary signage on energized compartments adjacent to the isolated and de-energized compartments; permanent signs on che rear of 
switchgear that matches compartment identification on 
the front; barricading adjacent energized compartments or 
equipment; and emphasis on a fundamental safe electrical 
work practice of testing every circuit, every conductor, every time 
before touching. 
Electrical Safety Paradigms, 
Myths, and Opportunities 
Electrical injury prevention depends, in pare, on the ability co assess the number, severity and underlying causes of 
electrical incidents in che workplace. Counting electrical 
incidents is difficult to accomplish. Coding of incidents 
varies depending on available event information. Employers vary in their effort or ability to report incidents, given 
that incidents may happen very quickly with little notice. 
Workplace cultures rend co exert peer pressure that favors 
not recording electrical incidents. Often, management is 
nor rewarded for reporting; rather, a track record of difficulties on a manager's time can take away from promotion and pay opportunities. Drawing attention to an 
unsafe act may not appreciated as in employees' best 
interest either because employees are expected to conduct 
themselves safely. While incident data is nor widely available, survey information suggests electrical hazards are 
recognized as potentially fatal. Tkachenko and colleagues 
reported their results from 480 respondents to a survey of 
1,200 electricians. Their average age was 40.2 years 
±10.3 years. They were predominantly male (477/480). 
Remarkably, 465 of the 477 (97%) respondents had experienced an electrical shock at work, and 123 of the 477 
(26%) respondents had witnessed an injury. When asked 
how often the possibility of an electrical injury was considered by the surveyed electricians, 278 of 477 (58%) 
respondents indicated "every day." 
The quality of incident data impacts everyone involved 
in managing the hazards associated with electrical forces 
including: 
educacors and trainers 
writers of codes, standards, and regulations 
decision-makers establishing safety related goals and 
objectives for an organization 
manufacturers of electrical produces 
designers, engineers, electricians, and others applying their skills everyday in the workplace. 
Electrical safety leaders are strategically important in 
enhancing the collection, analysis, and distribution of incident experiences. With improvement in incident data, 
transparent communications about incident frequency, 
prevalence, and consequences are possible. Better data can 
also support vertical training, so that there is continuity in 
the information about electrical hazards held from the top 
of the enterprise to the bottom, or, in personnel terms,

from the CEO to the contractor coming in to change the 
light bulbs. Incident data, to be meaningful, must be 
"fluid" in flow, that is, not barricaded or blocked in its 
sharing by infrastructure issues (e.g., lack of meetings, 
reports, simple access, communications patterns), hierarchy (e.g., only certain people get to know what happened), 
or intellectual property constraints. Finally, with better 
incident record-keeping, in an intimate or personally 
meaningful way, coworkers, colleagues, comparable locations, vendors, and consultants can "keep the memories 
alive" of success stories (i.e., what works in electrical safety) and the price for failure (e.g., funerals, amputations, 
disfigurement, lost careers, environmental destruction). 
Electrical safety presents unique challenges. First, as a 
hazard, electricity is silent, odorless, and invisible, even 
though the equipment that conducts it may be huge and 
located in difficult environments (which by themselves 
may be potentially hazardous, as with explosive chemicals, 
moving machines, or construction activities). Second, electricity use is routinely viewed as a safe experience: every 
time a light is turned on or a computer mouse points a 
cursor on a video display, electrons flow and injury or 
damage rarely if ever occurs. In other words, there are 
numerous common experiences in each person's daily life 
where electricity is essential but not noticeable in the 
completion of work. 
For electrical safety educators, the obligation is to 
raise awareness of electrical risk even though truly no 
risk may be perceived. After raising risk awareness, the 
challenge is to modify risk acceptability. This is more 
difficult when at the same time an employee personally, 
or an organization generally, may be friendly to the 
mentality or spirit that is captured by the notion of 
"once an employee can discern an electrical risk as unacceptable, he or she then can take the position of being in 
charge of their personal response to the hazard." Similarly, with greater knowledge, businesses can adapt their 
infrastructure and work management decisions. When 
hazards are identified and appreciated for their injury 
and damage possibilities, accountability to respond 
through engineering, administrative, and individual 
actions is more obvious. 
Modifying how an individual understands the acceptability of a risk, such as testing a circuit with a screwdriver 
or wet finger, is a different safety approach than making a 
rule of how an individual must behave, such as requiring 
the use of electrical tester to check the possible energy 
flow of a circuit. The approaches are not mutually exclusive, however, public health practice has numerous examples of how difficult it is to legislate behavior. Ultimately, 
a safety professional must grapple with the reality that 
there is no way to control all the individual acts that comprise electrical work operations. Education is the only way 
to constructively and pro-actively focus and channel a corporation's safety goals. Learning, as demonstrated through 
changed individual and organization practices, is the education-based mechanism that can optimize safety performance in electrical work environments. 
Financial benchmarks regarding the cost of electrical 
incidents are not readily available within the process 
industries. However, Wyzga and Lindroos have summarized the measured and estimated direct and indirect costs 
of the electrical injuries at a U.S. public utility employing 
union electricians from 1990-1992. In 1998, the reported 
cost experience per case was found to be US$15.75 million. For the utility's study period, the cases in the study 
accounted for 2% of the company's incidents bur 52% of 
the costs. Lutton noted the economic impact of injuries 
associated with electrical events in his estimates of the 
average total direct costs of work-related injury. Based on a 
five year study of a U .S. public utility, he estimated that 
each reported case had an average direct cost US$49,823, 
with inestimable indirect expenses. These numbers are 
useful to help define the scope of potential savings if electrical incidents are reduced. More significantly, the numbers are useful to explaining that, while training, practice 
innovation, personal protection programs, and other safety 
interventions are expensive, there is also a cost to doing 
work unsafely around electricity. There are no "savings" if 
electrical operations are managed without implementation 
of new standards, technologies, education, and record 
keeping. Rather, the expenses are distributed through 
accounts less readily monitored by electrical safety leaders 
and safety professionals, including equipment repairs and 
maintenance, outages, process interruptions, medical and 
disability payments, and litigation for fatalities and property losses. 
Conclusion 
This article outlines significant changes and developments 
impacting further improvement in the prevention of electrical incidents and their consequences. The reality is that 
it will take time to synthesize and transfer these advancements in standards and technology into real and broad 
reduction in exposure and consequences of electrical hazards. Further progress is not possible without the strategic 
involvement of safety and electrical safety professionals, 
who are best positioned in the general techniques of hazard analysis and risk assessment to significantly impact 
and accelerate changes for improving electrical safety, serving as the "electrical safety conscience" to owners, managers, electrical experts, and the workers most at risk t O 
electrical injuries. "Are we aware of current standardsWhat are they?" "Are we utilizing available technology -
how do you know?" "How are we staying current in developments impacting electrical safetyAre we sure?" 
"Considering serious electrical accidents are relatively rare, 
how do we measure the quality of our electrical safety 
program?" are just a few examples of how to exercise 
that conscience.
