Work zone safety is significantly impacted by vehicle intrusions, which are challenging incidents to control. 
Although the Federal Highway Administration and US state transportation agencies have implemented safety 
procedures to enhance worker and motorist safety, the rate of intrusions in work zones remains high, necessi­
tating the development of additional solutions. Work zone intrusion alert technologies (WZIATs) have shown 
promise in highway work zones; however, their application in short-term utility settings remains insufficiently 
studied. This research aims to characterize the features of intrusion alert systems that can enhance the safety of 
workers in utility work zones. To achieve this aim, the study adopted a mixed-method design approach, relying 
on literature review, archival data analysis, experimental assessments, and a case study. The study reveals that 
motorist/driver behavior is a primary safety risk factor in utility work zone intrusions. Insights from deploying 
two technologies, AWARE and Alpha Safe Net, in experimental and live utility work zones indicate that an 
effective WZIAT must be able to alert both drivers and workers, be deployable in less than three minutes, 
integrate audio, visual, and haptic alarms, have an adjustable warning light, incorporate a pneumatic tube 
triggering mechanism, and be waterproof. This study contributes to both knowledge and practice by charac­
terizing the safety risks associated with utility work zones and identifying key performance and operational 
features for deploying WZIATs in short-term work zones. 
1. Introduction 
Work zones experience different types of incidents which result in 
fatalities, injuries, and property damage. These incidents occur because 
of uncontrolled hazards present inside and outside the work zone (AlBayati et al., 2023). According to the Fatality Analysis Reporting System 
(FARS), one of the main risks and reasons for work zone fatalities is 
vehicle crashes, which resulted in 857 fatalities and 44,240 injuries in 
the US in 2020 (FARS, 2020). Intrusions and contact with trucks, multipurpose highway vehicles, and passenger vehicles are the leading causes 
of worker fatalities in active work zones (FHWA, 2007). Fatalities and 
injuries caused by work zone intrusions remain a vital issue in the utility 
space despite efforts by FHWA and several state DOTs to propose solu­
tions. For instance, 64 % of highway contractors reported crashes in 
their construction work zones in 2022 (Work Zone Barriers, 2023). 
These crashes occurred in different types of work zones, including short 
term and short duration work zones (Tapan et al., 2016). 
In response to the high number of injuries and fatalities in work 
zones, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and state de­
partments of transportation (DOTs) in the US have developed and 
implemented different procedures and manuals to improve traffic con­
trol in work zones, thereby enhancing the safety of workers and mo­
torists. Although these procedures have helped to improve work zone 
safety, incidents in work zones still occur at a high rate. Moreover, 
current traffic control measures and work area protection setups 
commonly employed, while useful, have not sufficiently protected 
workers in utility work zones from potentially fatal intrusions (Wang 
et al., 2013). Utility work zones are classified as short-term stationery 
(less than 1 day) or short duration (less than 1 h). 
To reduce intrusion-related incidents, the use of emerging solutions

such as intrusion warning devices has been proposed as a risk mitigation 
strategy (Schneider, 2014). Work Zone Intrusion Alert Technologies 
(WZIATs) are devices that monitor and detect vehicle intrusions into 
work zones (Nnaji et al., 2018). These technologies alert workers to an 
intrusion or potential intrusion, providing valuable reaction time (Nnaji 
et al., 2021; Khan et al., 2019). Additionally, these devices can warn 
motorists who are about to encroach into the work zone. 
However, WZIATs have primarily been tested and deployed on 
highway projects with long-term work zones. For instance, studies by 
Awolusi and Marks (2019), Khan et al. (2019), and Nnaji et al. (2018) 
evaluated work zone intrusion technologies on highway projects. 
Currently, limited guidelines are available to support the implementa­
tion of these devices in short-term and short-duration utility work zones. 
The unique characteristics of short-term and short-duration work 
zones—such as short work durations, limited traffic control setups, 
frequent relocations, changing layouts, and the dynamic nature of 
tasks—expose workers to higher levels of risk (Wang et al., 2013). These 
characteristics also make it more challenging to deploy certain risk 
mitigation solutions. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct research to 
ascertain the potential impact of emerging solutions such as WZIATs in 
short-term and short-duration applications. 
The present study addresses this gap in the literature and contributes 
to work zone safety research by characterizing the safety risks associated 
with short-term and short-duration utility work zones, and identifying 
key performance and operational features for deploying WZIATs in 
short-term utility work zones. 
2. Background 
Work zone accident has continued to be a primary cause of injuries 
and fatalities in the US, reaching a 17-year high in 2021 (Road­
s&Bridges, 2021). Work zone related fatalities increased by almost 11 % 
between 2020 and 2021, according to the Federal Highway Authority 
(FHWA) (FARS, 2022). Recent statistics show that work zone intrusions 
have increased significantly in 2020 despite reduced traffic volume 
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (Work Zone Barriers, 2021; NSC, 
2021). The fatalities occurred in different types of work zones, with 479, 
56, and 8 deaths reported in construction, maintenance, and utility work 
zones, respectively (FARS, 2020). The reported fatalities were drivers of 
motor vehicles (530), pedestrians (156), passengers of motor vehicles 
(150), bicyclists (14), and others (7) (FARS, 2020). About 15 % of 
pedestrian work zone fatalities occur in utility work zones (FHTSA 
FARS, 2019; FHWA, 2020). According to the Center for Construction 
Research and Training (CPWR), 59 utility workers died in roadway work 
zones between 2011 and 2016. Furthermore, 15 power-line installers 
were killed in roadway work zones throughout the same time span, 
representing an incidence rate of 11.6 fatalities per 100,000 FTEs. This 
rate was the fourth highest fatality rate for roadway occupations (Wang 
et al., 2018). 
Work zone intrusions pose a significant threat to the safety of 
workers in an active work zone and are a primary concern for the utility 
industry. Over the years, the number of work zone intrusions has been 
increasing. For instance, the number of fatalities caused by intrusions 
has risen 42 % since 2013 (Work Zone Barriers, 2021). About 80 % of 
pedestrians (those working in the work zone) were killed by a driver 
intruding into the work zone (FHTSA FARS, 2019). This class of work 
zone incidents often leads to high severity outcomes (Bryden and 
Andrew, 1999; Bryden et al., 2000). For instance, a single intrusion can 
lead to multiple deaths and extensive property damage. 
Intrusions are more challenging to control compared to incidents 
that emanate from inside the work zone, and traditional traffic control 
protection methods are not very effective at mitigating work zone 
intrusion risks, especially in utility work zones (Wang et al., 2013; 
Schneider, 2014). Utility workspaces present unique challenges for work 
area protection due to the short durations which are common for utility 
work, such as electric utility activities. Distracted driving (e.g., using cell 
phones) and increased speed have become increasingly prevalent and 
are factors which are critical to the risk associated with working 
alongside or on the roadway. Other significant risk factors include 
confusion caused by faulty work zone traffic control set up, ineligible 
signs, poor road conditions, deprived sleep (fatigue), and consumption 
of alcohol and drugs (Ullman et al., 2011). 
Wang et al. (2013) investigated the effectiveness of traffic control 
devices within the context of short-term work zones in terms of com­
manding the respect of drivers, durability, ease of understanding, cost, 
ease of installation and removal, and reusability. The researchers rec­
ommended the use of plastic portable rumble strips, portable changeable 
message signs, vehicle activated signs, truck mounted attenuators, and 
mobile barriers to protect motorists and workers in work zones (Wang 
et al., 2013). Moreover, the research study revealed limitations of using 
adhesive these system in short-term work zones and recommended 
additional research within this context. 
Previous studies have identified intrusion mitigation technologies 
that can be used in work zones such as mobile barriers, temporary 
rumble strips, message boards, vehicle arresting systems, automated 
flagging devices, rolling roadblocks, and intrusion alarms (Nnaji et al., 
2020; 2021). However, Anderson et al. (2016) highlighted that work 
zone intrusion mitigation needs controls that do not rely on driver 
assessment and response given that drivers might be impaired. While 
these mitigation technologies are promising, challenges associated with 
traffic control setups (e.g., extended time needed for setup and takedown) for utility work zones may impact the successful deployment of 
these solutions. 
2.1. Work zone intrusion alert technologies 
Recently, researchers have explored the potential of a new intrusion 
mitigation solution: Work Zone Intrusion Alert Technologies (WZIATs). 
These devices monitor and detect vehicle intrusions into work zones, 
alerting workers to actual or potential intrusions and thereby providing 
them with valuable reaction time (Nnaji et al., 2021). Since 2016, 
numerous studies have examined the effectiveness of these technologies. 
For instance, researchers evaluated the effectiveness of Sono Blaster, 
Traffic Guard Worker Alert system (WAS) and Intellicone (Awolusi and 
Marks, 2019; Nnaji et al., 2018). These studies showed that these 
technologies produce more than multiple alarms used to warn workers 
of an intrusion incident. The researchers reported a satisfactory result 
regarding power consumption and battery performance, easy set-up of 
the technologies, and limited false alarms, while further testing in 
different scenarios was recommended to document additional benefits 
and limitations of these technologies. Sanni (2019) also evaluated the 
effectiveness of several work zone intrusion technologies through 
focused testing of the technologies. The WAS exhibited good perfor­
mance with some restrictions, the Sonoblaster system presented several 
challenges related to its use and effectiveness that could not be resolved, 
and the Intellicone system performed well after consulting with the 
manufacturer. 
While most WZIATs are designed to warn workers after an intrusion 
occurs, a few have the potential to proactively inform both workers and 
motorists of an impending intrusion. Currently, two intrusion alert 
devices—the Advanced Warning and Risk Evasion (AWARE) system and 
Alpha Safe Net Overwatch—have shown significant promise as proactive 
warning systems. 
2.1.1. AWARE 
The AWARE system is a radar-based advanced warning system 
developed to detect intrusions using the speed of vehicles heading to­
ward the work zone (Fig. 1). The technology developers have created 
two versions of the AWARE system. The first version is designed to 
detect work zone intrusions and is called “lane intrusion.” The second 
version, called Sentry, is primarily intended for use by flaggers. 
Although both systems use the same components, there is a key

difference between the two. The lane intrusion system can be mounted 
on moving vehicles and equipment, while the Sentry is kept fixed in a 
hard case at a location. During testing for the present study, only the 
Sentry was available to the researchers and considered for further 
assessment (Mishra et al., 2021). 
2.2.1.2. Alpha Safe Net Overwatch. Alpha Safe Net Overwatch is a 
Li DAR-based technology. The system is available in two versions. The 
first version is equipment-mounted and the second version is portable 
(Fig. 2). The difference between the two systems is that the mounted 
system can be placed at working vehicles, while the portable system is 
placed on the alarm unit. During testing, only the portable version was 
available to the researchers and this version was selected for further 
assessment. The portable overwatch device is placed on the roadside in 
case of traffic disruption due to the work zone setup. Once activated, the 
system creates an invisible electronic barrier (laser line) that runs 
straight, shielding the work zone or traffic incident location. If a vehicle 
crosses the electronic barrier represented by the laser line, the Over­
watch technology triggers a flashing light and horn alarm to warn the 
driver and workers. If the driver notices the alarm and makes the 
necessary correction, the alarms (horn and flashing light) stop. 
Furthermore, workers present in the work zone are alerted about the 
intrusion and can swiftly take action to avoid being struck by the 
intruding vehicle. 
A summary of notable features and recommended deployment stra­
tegies for the AWARE and Alpha Safe Net Overwatch systems are pre­
sented in Table 1. 
2.2. Research need 
Work zone intrusion incidents are one of the main risks affecting 
work zone operations in the construction industry. Studies have inves­
tigated the major factors causing these types of incidents, and recom­
mended some mitigation strategies over the last decade with the goal of 
improving work zone safety. Although short-term utility work zones are 
facing several safety challenges, very limited studies have investigated 
these concerns or proffered solutions that are specific to their charac­
teristics in terms of the work type and duration. 
Short-term work zones, such as utility operations, require special 
attention in comparison to long-term work zones like highway con­
struction and maintenance operations. These zones typically occupy 
only a section of the roadway or sidewalk, with their layout often 
changing rapidly due to the nature of the work, such as moving equip­
ment or repositioning barriers (Datta et al., 2008). Crews in short-term 
work zones are frequently relocated as they move from one site to 
another to address various issues or projects. Activities in short-term 
work zones, such as utility work, often involve emergency response 
situations, like repairing or restoring power after an outage, necessi­
tating quick setup and efficient management of work zones. Due to their 
short duration and small size, utility work zones may have limited traffic 
control measures compared to larger, long-term road construction pro­
jects, with traffic control devices and barriers often being temporary and

easy to set up and remove quickly. 
These unique characteristics of short-term work zones create traffic 
control challenges. The frequent movement and relocation required in 
short-term work zones necessitate intrusion alert systems that are highly 
mobile and easy to redeploy, complicating the setup and calibration of 
these systems. Moreover, these systems must be designed for rapid 
deployment and removal without compromising their effectiveness. The 
limited space available in short-term work zones makes it challenging to 
deploy extensive intrusion detection infrastructure, requiring compact 
and versatile systems. Given that the layout and boundaries of shortterm work zones can change rapidly, the intrusion system used in this 
context must quickly adapt to new configurations without extensive 
recalibration. 
A detailed review of existing studies revealed limited work zone 
safety risk assessment studies focused on utility work zones. Previous 
WZIAT evaluations focused on highway work zone conditions and ap­
plications (Khan et al., 2019; Nnaji et al., 2018), ignoring the distinc­
tiveness of other types of work zones. Besides, very few studies have 
evaluated the potential impact of proactive WZIATs, and previous 
WZIAT studies (Awolusi and Marks, 2019; Nnaji et al., 2018; Thapa and 
Mishra, 2021; Khan et al., 2019; Ullman and Theiss, 2019; Martin et al., 
2016; Mishra et al., 2021) did not consider two distinct conditions – (1) 
at an elevation and (2) within an intersection – when evaluating the 
performance of WZIATs in controlled settings. 
Studies of utility work zones are needed to answer questions about 
the primary safety risk factors that cause work zone intrusion incidents 
in utility work zones and available mitigation technologies that could be 
used to mitigate these risks. Considering the significant safety challenges 
in utility work zones and the lack of information on WZIAT applications 
within this context, there is an urgent need to explore the potential 
impact of WZIATs on worker safety within this context. Therefore, the 
objectives of this study are to: 
Identify key safety risks associated with intrusions into utility work 
zones. 
Evaluate the performance of intrusion alert devices within utility 
work zones. 
Characterize the necessary features of technologies aimed at miti­
gating intrusions in utility work zones. 
3. Research methodology 
The research team adopted a mixed-methods approach that consisted 
of a literature review, archival analysis, interviews, controlled/experi­
mental testing, and a case study. 
3.1. Identification of safety risk factors and WZIATs 
A qualitative approach consisting of a scoping literature review and 
archival analysis was used in the study to identify the safety risks 
associated with electric utility work zones. The literature review 
involved a search of the available academic and grey literature using 
different online search engines and databases containing work zone 
intrusion incidents. The main databases searched were Transportation 
Research International Documentation (TRID) and the National Work 
Zone Safety Information Clearinghouse (NWZSIC), both of which are 
recommended sources for transportation and work zone research (Nnaji 
et al., 2020). In addition, the researchers performed a search in available 
archival incident databases, such as those overseen by the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), using keywords related to 
work zones. The searches were conducted to identify the documented 
work zone intrusion incidents. Given that NIOSH reports a subset of 
cases captured in the OSHA database, the researchers reviewed each 
case and removed those that were redundant (appeared in both OSHA 
and NIOSH databases). The incidents were then analyzed to determine 
the main safety risk factors that led to the incidents. Based on this 
analysis, the unique identified safety risk factors were placed in a risk 
register and analyzed in terms of frequency of occurrence and their 
relation to utility work zones, if applicable. More than one risk factor 
could be identified with a single incident case. By completing this step, a 
risk register summarizing the main risk factors that cause work zone 
intrusion incidents in general and especially for utility work zones was 
developed which helped identify technologies that can mitigate the 
primary safety risks. 
Subsequently, the researchers identified WZIATs published in exist­
ing literature on previous studies. WZIATs are devices that monitor work 
areas, detect vehicle intrusions into work zones, and alert workers when 
an intrusion occurs. A few studies have evaluated WZIATs in different 
applications, however, some WZIATs have not yet been evaluated at this 
time. The research team streamlined the identified WZIATs based on 
cost, availability, ease of use, possible implementation/integration into 
traffic control plans, and the technology’s potential to enhance worker 
safety in utility work zones (mitigating the safety risks identified in the 
literature review and archival data analysis). 
3.2. Verification of safety risk factors and appropriate WZIATs 
The research team conducted semi-structured interviews of utility 
company personnel to collect data regarding current work zone prac­
tices and policies, high-risk work activities, and perceptions of workzone intrusion technologies. Twenty-three safety professionals across 
six organizations volunteered to participate in the semi-structured in­
terviews. These companies operate in various locations around the 
United States and range in size from small to large with respect to 
number of employees. Further detail on the interviewees’ companies can 
be found in Table 2. Interviewee position titles included field safety 
manager, corporate safety manager, operations manager, and crew 
leader. The interviews were not limited to short answer responses; 
rather, participants were asked open- and closed-ended questions and 
provided sufficient time to ask questions about the study and share any 
additional thoughts or comments they may have. Interviews were con­
ducted online via Zoom and/or Microsoft Teams. 
The interviews included a combination of single person interviews 
and group interviews. Each interview lasted approximately one hour. 
The interviews were audio and video recorded and Microsoft Word was 
used for real-time transcription of the audio recordings. The real-time 
transcripts were then checked for accuracy following the interview. 
Qualitative analysis was performed using the interview transcripts. 
The transcripts were initially uploaded to an analysis software (NVivo 
version release 1.5.1), which allowed for an iterative review process. 
Then, several top-tier codes (i.e., key words used to capture themes 
present in the interviews) were created in the software. The codes were 
based on the interview questions asked and researcher perceptions of 
common trends. Each transcript was highlighted in the software based 
on the top-tier codes. The codes were selected to determine which 
technologies are currently being used by utility companies and which 
technologies are of interest. There was also a focus on high-risk activ­
ities, current practices and procedures, and general concerns regarding 
the implementation of work zone intrusion technologies. “Children”

codes were created after patterns from the top-tier codes were identified. 
The children codes highlighted further details provided by interview 
participants, and included technology specific concerns and applications 
and information on the use of law enforcement for traffic control. 
3.3. WZIATs assessment 
The selected technologies were initially tested under controlled, offroadway conditions in a secure location that was not exposed to public 
traffic. These tests facilitates the comprehension of WZIAT features, 
their strengths, weaknesses, and the implementation process for each 
technology. The test results could be utilized to ascertain the feasibility, 
capabilities, and limitations of each technology. The researchers con­
ducted experiments at the Texas A&M Transportation Institute (TTI) 
Proving Ground facility located on the Texas A&M RELLIS Campus using 
three different vehicles – a sedan, an SUV, and a truck. The researchers 
created several scenarios that mimicked utility work zones described in 
fatality reports. Each of the selected technologies was assessed to cap­
ture its capabilities in terms of: (1) level of audible alerts; (2) trans­
mission range, and (3) false alarms. The technologies were rated based 
on quantitative data collected by the research team using different data 
collection techniques (e.g., sound meter). 
The noticeability of sound alarms depends heavily on the intensity 
and characteristics of the sound alerts relative to the ambient noise level 
in the surrounding environment. To determine the intensity of sound 
alerts produced by the WZIATs, a sound meter, REED R8080, was used 
to measure the sound produced by the WZIAT. The sound meter was 
held at a height of 3 ft above the ground at different distances from the 
alarm devices. The testing criteria (e.g., sound level) were measured 
across distances that varied from 0 ft (at source) to 500 ft in approxi­
mately 50 ft increments. Three readings for sound intensity were taken 
at each interval/increment. To determine if the orientation of the alarms 
affected the intensity of the alerts produced, sound intensity was 
measured from five different directions by changing the alarm’s orien­
tation. The test started with the researchers measuring the sound at the 
source by pointing the sound meter at the speaker (south direction). 
Previous research has indicated that the construction industry faces a 
significant challenge in implementing and adopting WZIATs due to the 
relatively high likelihood of false alarms (Nnaji et al., 2020; Burkett 
et al., 2009; Nnaji et al., 2021). To address this issue, the research team 
conducted a controlled experiment in which each WZIAT was triggered 
at least 10 times per condition/scenario. The focus was on assessing the 
frequency of false negatives (the device failing to produce an alarm 
when it should). In addition, the research team observed and recorded 
any false positive (the device produces an alarm when it should not). 
In addition to scenarios explored in previous studies (Awolusi and 
Marks, 2019; Nnaji et al., 2020), the present study considered two 
distinct conditions not covered in previous research – (1) at an elevation 
(Fig. 1) and (2) within an intersection (Fig. 3) – when evaluating the 
performance of WZIATs in controlled settings. The research team 
assessed the potential of each technology to detect an intrusion along 
eight paths as shown in Fig. 1. Given the nature of the Alpha Safe Net 
triggering mechanism, the device was placed in three different locations 
(Fig. 3b). 
Subsequently, the team evaluated the potential impact of elevation 
on the effectiveness of WZIATs by simulating a work zone at an eleva­
tion, as shown in Fig. 4. To evaluate the potential impact of a difference 
in elevation on the performance of the intrusion alert devices, the 
research team identified an elevated location at the TAMU Proving 
Gound (approximately 6 feet difference in elevation at the highest 
point). As shown in Fig. 4, the devices were placed at the highest and 
lowest point while the approaching vehicle started at the opposite 
location (e.g., the vehicle starts at the lowest elevation point if the device 
was placed in the highest elevation point). 
The transmission range refers to the maximum distance or area 
within which the technology components can communicate with each 
other. The range is an important consideration when implementing 
intrusion alert technologies because it determines the coverage area or 
work zone length that can be effectively served by the technology (Nnaji 
et al., 2018). The coverage area is crucial to consider when selecting 
systems because technologies designed for work zone applications may

become ineffective if used in work zones that exceed their transmission 
range. The objective of this experiment was to ascertain the transmission 
range of different components for selected technologies. The research 
team also evaluated how much is needed to deploy and remove the 
WZIATs. 
3.4. Evaluation of WZIATs and extraction of key features 
Following the completion of the controlled test, the subsequent 
phase involved the practical application of the two targeted technologies 
(AWARE and Alpha Safe Net) within a live utility work zone project. The 
primary objectives behind deploying the technologies in a real-world 
project were threefold: (1) introduce the innovations to industry pro­
fessionals, allowing them to gain firsthand experience with the tech­
nology; (2) solicit feedback and comments from industry experts 
regarding the technology’s performance and potential enhancements; 
(3) assess reactions of individuals working in the presence of the tech­
nologies to develop critical insights into their practical value and impact 
within the context of utility work zones. 
The research team conducted a focus group meeting with the 
workers at the project site to explain the deployment and use of each 
technology. Eighteen workers participated in the meeting, and it 
included a demonstration showing the triggering mechanism for each 
technology. Immediately following the orientation, a survey was sent 
out to the participants seeking feedback on the technologies prior to 
their deployment in the work zone. The deployment, use, and removal of 
the technologies was monitored by the research team on a live project 
(Fig. 5), in addition to the use and movement of the workers in the 
presence of the technology. Afterwards, the workers were interviewed to 
obtain and record their feedback about the technology and its effect on 
their safety. The data collected from the case study provides insight on 
the feasibility, obstacles, facilitators, and expected impact of each 
technology. In addition, the data helps create recommendations for ideal 
features of future WZIAT for utility applications. 
4. Results and discussion 
4.1. Work zone intrusion safety risk assessment 
The literature review revealed that few studies have focused on 
short-term, short-duration work zones, with no studies on utility work 
zone safety. Nine articles discussed risk factors associated with work 
zone intrusion incidents based on analysis of archived data including 
DOT reports. However, none of these articles was comprehensive in 
terms of the case descriptions and the studies were primarily limited to a 
certain geographical region (e.g., in New York or California). Therefore, 
a comprehensive archival search for and review of work zone intrusion 
incidents in available OSHA and NIOSH databases was conducted to 
identify the main risk factors leading to work zone intrusion accidents 
and analyze risk factors in terms of frequency and relation to utility work 
zones. Overall, 440 work zone-related incident cases were analyzed, and 
219 of the cases were related to work zone intrusions. Forty-nine cases 
involving utility work zones (electric and others) were found in the 
databases, as shown in Table 3. Fifteen of these cases (30.1 %) were 
classified under work zone intrusions (incidents involving an intrusion), 
as depicted in Table 4. 
Thirteen primary work zone intrusion risk factors were identified 
and grouped into six categories: (1) Motorist/Driver, (2) Vehicle, (3) 
Roadway/Environmental Condition, (4) Work Operation, (5) Worker, 
and (6) Other. As shown in Table 4, approximately half (50.32 %) of the 
identified work zone intrusion incidents resulted from motorist/driver 
actions (e.g., impaired or distracted driver), and work operations and 
roadway/environmental conditions were each associated with approx­
imately 6 % of the incidents. The primary risk factor for approximately 
30 % of the reviewed reports could not be determined from the infor­
mation provided. The top five Motorist/Driver risk factors, based on the 
number of occurrences, were: (1) vehicle trajectory, (2) vehicle speed, 
(3) driver condition (e.g., impaired and sleeping drivers), (4) driver 
awareness, and (5) driver behavior. For electric utility work zones, the 
primary risk category was Motorist/Driver (67 %), followed by Work 
Operation (20 %). Table 5 summarizes the risk factors at the group level. 
Results from the interviews supported the findings from the archival 
analysis and literature review. For example, an interview participant

stated, “… for the most part, any work that we do to repair the [electric 
utility] system is going to put us at risk because it’s all done along the 
roadway.” However, there were several cases and activities which were 
discussed in greater detail and noted to put utility workers at the 
greatest risk of being struck by an errant vehicle. For instance, flagging 
activities were noted by almost every participant interviewed as a highrisk activity. Most participants stated that flaggers are at the highest risk 
of injury amongst anyone in a work zone because they are at the front of 
the work zone. Thus, flaggers would be the first person in harm’s way if a 
vehicle were to intrude into the work area protection setup. Single 
person work (i.e., a worker working alone) was also noted as a high-risk 
activity because there is typically no work area protection around the 
sole worker. Single person work includes activities such as checking 
meters or performing inspections. 
Most other concerns regarding work zone intrusions stemmed from 
roadway geometry and vehicle speeds. Several interviewees mentioned 
that there is often more risk involved with working in rural areas. 
Hazardous conditions identified include work on two-lane roadways 
with speeds from 40 to 55 miles per hour, and mountainous roadways, 
curves, and non-interstate speed highways. Additionally, work per­
formed near intersections or parking lots was considered high risk. 
Lastly, weather conditions and time of day could affect the amount of 
risk associated with utility activities. For example, in rain, snow, or icy 
conditions, a vehicle is more likely to lose control and enter a work zone. 
Low light conditions can also cause visibility problems which may lead 
to an intrusion. Overall, high risk activities vary based on location, 
timing, roadway design, and weather conditions. Because of the nature 
of utility work, most activities are at risk of experiencing a work zone 
intrusion. This exposure puts every utility worker in danger of being 
struck by an intruding vehicle. 
4.2. Work zone intrusion alert technology selection 
The interviewees also provided their perspective regarding the use of 
WZIAT in work zones. In general, study participants noted willingness to 
pilot WZIAT in their work zones. However, implementation of these 
technologies did not come without concerns. First, ease of deployment is 
an important factor in selecting a technology. Utility work is often short 
duration, lasting anywhere from 30 min to several hours. Any technol­
ogy used for work zone mitigation must be deployed and retracted 
quickly – preferably in under three minutes – to ensure that the work 
duration is longer than the deployment process. If the deployment of the 
technology is not efficient, workers may be exposed to more risk by 
setting up traffic control measures than by performing the electric utility 
activity. 
Second, cost is a factor which must be considered in the imple­
mentation of a new technology. While most of the interviewees stated 
that cost would not be “hugely prohibitive,” smaller companies may 
need to consider this on a deeper level. This is due to an avoidance of 
raising service process, such electric power prices, for consumers. 
However, all companies stated that with proper documentation and 
rationale, cost could be irrelevant. 
Third, availability of resources is a big concern for utility companies 
when choosing to pilot a new technology. Resources could include 
physical materials, storage space on bucket trucks, and manpower. 
Several interviewees noted that storage space on bucket trucks is limited 
already, so crews may push back a bit when asked to add another traffic 
control technology to the already cramped truck. In addition, employees 
from company F stated, “The crews are limited enough as it is. We don’t 
have the extra manpower to drive extra vehicles and extra equipment 
around.” Alongside manpower, physical resources may be lacking. There 
may not be enough devices to deploy with every crew, so some workers 
may be hesitant to adopt the technology. If the crews cannot use the 
technology for every job, they may choose to not use the technology at 
all. 
Fourth, participants highlighted the need for WZIAT to work effec­
tively in practical situations such as at different elevations and close to 
roadway intersections. Unfortunately, little to no data is available on 
how intrusion alert systems perform in these conditions. 
Based on the list of identified commercially available WZIATs, and 
the adoption factors described above, the Advanced Warning and Risk 
Evasion (AWARE) system and the Alpha Safe Net Overwatch were found 
to meet most of the desired criteria: providing an advanced warning to 
the driver and worker before an accident occurs. 
4.3. Controlled tests of selected WZIATs 
As described in Section 2, experiments were conducted to evaluate 
the efficacy of selected technologies within a controlled environment. 
Sound level: The ambient noise level was approximately 55 d B. 
Fig. 6 shows a comparison of the sound levels measured for the different 
orientations at different distances. The sound level was consistently 
higher when measured in facing the speaker and when the device was 
oriented towards 45-degree. It should be noted that the speaker is 
located on the south side of the AWARE and Alpha Safe Net systems. 
Additional trials were conducted to measure the sound level inside 
the approaching vehicle to determine if the sound level is perceptible to 
the driver. According to Murphy and King (2022), a 3 d B increase is just 
noticeable, a 5 d B increase is clearly perceptible, and 10 d B increase is 
perceived twice as loud relative to the initial noise level. The SUV was 
used for this measurement, and the vehicle stopped at 100 ft interval 
distances between the starting point and maximum distance (500 ft). 
The sound level inside the vehicle was 42 d B when the vehicle was idling 
(engine and AC on). The results presented in Fig. 7 highlight the mea­
surements from inside the vehicle when the AWARE and Alpha Safe Net 
systems were triggered, respectively. As shown in the tables, the effect of 
triggering the AWARE and Alpha Safe Net systems (increase in d B) was 
noted the most when these devices were triggered 100 ft away and the 
effect declined as the distance increased. 
Triggering Range: The maximum work zone speed limit (speed 
limit that triggers AWARE) at which AWARE could be set was 45 MPH.

Consequently, the work zone speed limit was configured at 45 MPH. 
Throughout the 10 tests, AWARE consistently triggered at distances 
between 450 and 500 ft. An additional trial was conducted at a speed of 
65 MPH, which did not impact the triggering range (remained between 
450 and 500 ft). Based on the conducted tests, the maximum triggering 
range of AWARE was determined to be approximately 500 ft. The 
maximum distance for the Alpha Safe Net was determined to be 300 ft 
when targeting the Li DAR line against a traffic cone and barrel. The 
device failed to trigger when tested 350 ft and 400 ft away from the 
device. Subsequently, a larger object (F-150 truck) was employed for 
targeting, which proved successful at distances of 300 ft, 350 ft, 400 ft, 
500 ft, and 550 ft. Beyond that range, targeting failed at 600 ft and 650 
ft. Consequently, it was concluded that using larger objects such as 
cones, barrels, and trucks can enhance the target distance and simplify 
the targeting process. 
Transmission Range: The transmission range between the main 
AWARE alarm unit and the personal safety device (Worktrax) was 
assessed in front of the device by standing at a certain distance away 
from the main alarm unit and triggering the device using the mobile 
application to check the maximum transmission range between the base 
unit and the Worktrax. The maximum distance recorded was 850 ft 
when measured in front of the device. A distance up to 150 ft was 
confirmed behind the device as well. As for Alpha Safe Net, the trans­
mission range between the main alarm unit and secondary unit was 
assessed in front of the device by standing at a certain distance away 
from the main alarm unit, and triggering the device by crossing the 
Li DAR line (waving in front of the laser, for instance) while it is in the 
target mode. The maximum recorded distance was 900 ft. 
False Negative Alarms: The AWARE system successfully triggered 
every time (10 out of 10 trials; 100 % success) for the different setups. 
Similar trials were performed at higher vehicle speeds for the different 
work zone limits using three different vehicles, and the same result was 
noted (100 % success). The Alpha Safe Net did not produce any false 
negatives as well (100 % success) when triggered multiple times. The 
smaller alarm unit was successfully triggered, and each time it was 
triggered, the secondary unit produced visual and audio alarms. 
False Positive Alarms: When performing the false negative alarm 
testing, the researchers took note of any potential false positive alarms. 
All alarms generated during the false negative tests were a result of 
actual triggering events; therefore, no false positives were recorded. 
However, for the Alpha Safe Net device, two false positive alarms were 
recorded. These false alarms were produced because of the inability of 
the technology’s triggering mechanism (targeted Li DAR line) to differ­
entiate between low or no risk events and high-risk events. The alarm 
triggers once the Li DAR line is disrupted by humans, animals, or an 
object. 
Scenario I: Intersection 
The AWARE system was successfully triggered 57 % of the trials for 
the different intersection scenarios (4 out of 7 scenarios). The results 
were the same regardless of the vehicle used (SUV, truck, and sedan) and 
the device position (outside edge, center, and inside edge of the lane). 
Each condition was verified five times. The system was not expected to 
trigger in one of the scenarios – Path 3 – and triggering would have been 
considered a false alarm. The device did not activate when vehicles 
drove by the protected work area following path 3, thereby highlighting 
the device effectiveness. However, the AWARE system failed to trigger 
when vehicle approached the work zone around a bend/curve. The 
Alpha Safe Net system sounded an alarm in four out of seven paths 
assessed (57 %) for the intersection scenarios. Similar to the AWARE 
system, the results were the same regardless of the vehicle used (SUV, 
truck, and sedan) and the device position (outside edge, center, and 
inside edge of the lane). Each condition was verified 9 times, and Table 6 
summarizes the results. 
Scenario II: Elevation 
Device at low position/elevation: The AWARE triggered successfully 
when using the SUV, sedan, and truck for all five trials for each of the 
different speeds tested. However, the triggering range was negatively 
impacted (i.e., decreased) at higher speeds due to the technology’s 
limited vision/reach at lower elevation. Alpha Safe Net triggered suc­
cessfully for each of the different speeds tested. The triggering range was 
negatively impacted (decreased) with the vehicle size (i.e., as the vehicle

size decreased, the triggering range also decreased). Placing the device 
on the truck bed did not improve (increase) the triggering range, on the 
contrary; the range decreased. 
Device at high position/elevation: The AWARE triggered successfully 
when the vehicles approached the device at different speeds. The 
triggering range for AWARE consistently performed better with 
approach speeds between 25 and 45 MPH when placed at an elevation 
compared to when positioned at the lower elevation. The Alpha Safe Net 
triggered successfully when each vehicle was used with different 
approach speeds. However, the triggering ranges were less than the 
values recorded when the device was placed at the lower elevation. This 
result is likely because the level of the Li DAR line is higher than the 
vehicle’s height until the vehicle approaches a point in the inclination 
where the laser can detect the vehicle. 
4.4. Live project tests 
The live project evaluation involved a demonstration, focus group, 
and deployment on a live project. Following the demonstration, the 
researchers engaged the 18 participants in a discussion focused on the 
applicability of the WZIATs into their work process and the features of 
an ideal WZIATs. Some of the key features mentioned were sufficient 
reaction time, alert drivers and workers, limited time for deployment and 
removal, simple and robust technology, and availability of vendor for repairs. 
After the discussion with the participants, they were asked to complete a 
survey questionnaire to measure their perception toward the WZIAT 
using five criteria – ease of use, ease of integration, sound effectiveness, 
light effectiveness, sound distinction, and alert noticeability by driver. 
Half of the participants (9 of the 18 workers) completed the survey. The 
five-point Likert scale ranged from very difficult/ineffective/indistinc­
tive/unnoticeable (1) to Very easy/effective/distinctive/noticeable (5), 
with the middle point (3) indicating neutral. The survey results are 
based on median values and summarized in Fig. 8.

across the five assessment criteria. Most participants were not certain of 
the level of effort needed to use and integrate these WZIATs into their 
practice. However, they believe that the alerting mechanisms used to 
alert workers and drivers are effective. 
Throughout the day, the WZIAT remained activated and detected 
four vehicles entering the work zone, all affiliated with the project. The 
research team closely observed the workers’ reactions during this 
period, noting their attentiveness to the audible alerts and their incli­
nation to glance in the direction of the traffic. When the intrusion events 
occurred, the workers’ responses were notably positive, as they 
promptly directed their attention towards the traffic and source of the 
sound, in accordance with expectations. The findings from the live test 
reveal that workers believe the technologies are useful in utility oper­
ations, especially in non-mobile operations. Alpha Safe Net recorded a 
100 % triggering rate (no false positive or negative) while AWARE was 
not deployed as part of the work operation. 
5. WZIAT required features and practical insights. 
Based on the findings obtained from the literature review, archival 
data analysis, pilot and live tests, and surveys conducted in this study, 
the researchers compiled a list of critical features that a WZIAT should 
possess for enhanced effectiveness and safety in utility work zones. 
These features are summarized in Table 7. These recommendations aim 
to optimize WZIAT functionality and address specific challenges 
encountered in the context of utility work zones. 
5.1. Alert system 
WZIATs should at least have a combination of audio and visual 
alarms as the work conditions in utility work zones could impede the 
effective transfer of either alert mechanism. Relying solely on visual 
alerts may be insufficient in daytime work, and relying solely on audio 
alert may be insufficient in a very noisy environment. Furthermore, 
WZIATs should have the ability to add personal safety devices and 
additional alarm units that could be carried around by the workers or 
placed beside them. This feature will provide additional safety protec­
tion, especially in environments where the workers are far from the 
main unit, or the work generates sound levels above 90 d BA and it is 
difficult to hear the main unit alarm. Haptic/vibration alert via a per­
sonal device provides an additional layer of protection for workers who 
are wearing hearing protection devices due to their exposure and 
proximity to sources of excessive noise. Workers focused on the task at 
hand may not be staring at the primary unit, so providing a multi-modal 
alert mechanism will improve worker responsiveness to the alert 
significantly. 
For WZIAT to be effective, it must have the capacity to alert both 
workers and drivers. Providing an advance alert offers additional reac­
tion time for the driver to adjust their actions, thereby preventing an 
intrusion into the work zone. If the drivers fail to modify the behavior, 
the proactive nature of the device will provide workers with additional 
time to run to a safe place. Adding an option to control the color of light 
produced by the device would help the end-user adhere to different 
states restrictions regarding the use of lights in work zones. For instance, 
certain states prohibit the use of blue light in work zones (Ahmed et al., 
2021). In addition to the color of light, the light intensity plays a critical 
role in perception (Gambatese et al., 2017). WZIATs should have 
Oscillating, flashing, or strobe-like lights that are perceptible at least 500 
feet away from the light source. Given the need for work-related vehicles 
and equipment to enter the work zones at different times, it is important 
to have a feature that allows for remotely disarming the alert. A remotecontrol feature to turn the device on and off will help limit false positive 
alarms. 
5.2. Triggering mechanism 
The traffic control crew (including the flaggers and safety personnel) 
should collectively decide on the most appropriate location to deploy 
the WZIAT, especially in extended works zone closures where there 
could be multiple placement options. The additional features provided 
by some of the WZIATs – such as a pneumatic tube, additional alarm 
unit, and personal safety devices – should be taken into consideration as 
well. Adding a pneumatic tube to WZIATs as a trigger will help minimize 
the impact of directional or line-of sight-based triggering mechanisms. 
The pneumatic tube would ensure that work zones with elevated grades, 
curves, and intersections are better protected given the ability of the 
pneumatic tube to extend the triggering range of the primary unit. 
However, manufacturers should be mindful of potential radio frequency 
signal conflict that may arise when the system is deployed in a location 
that includes deploying other devices with similar frequencies. 
When deploying WZIAT in work zones, workers should consider 
placing the device in such a way that it minimizes false positive as much 
as possible. Consistent false alarms will lead to alarm fatigue, thereby 
increasing the risk of workers ignoring alarms associated with in­
trusions. In work zones. Workers should be educated about the device 
triggering mechanism and how to avoid potential false alarms. WZIATs 
should include options for controlling (narrowing down) the lateral

triggering range which would help when using the device in multi lanes 
highway. This option will significantly reduce the number of false pos­
itive alarms coming from lanes far from the work zone closed lane. The 
sensitivity of Li DAR should be adjustable to help reduce false alarms that 
could be generated from low-risk nonvehicle related intrusions. 
For WZIATs that are triggered based on the speed thresholds 
designed to align with work zone speed limits, it is recommended that 
the options for the speed limit threshold account for potential work 
zones that do not impact the throughput speed (e.g., utility work con­
ducted on the shoulder). A lower threshold will lead to multiple false 
positive alerts, which could impact both drivers and workers negatively. 
For instance, some work zones have a 65 MPH speed limit, and using a 
WZIAT that has an upper threshold of 45 MPH will generate constant 
false alarms. It is essential to develop mechanisms to control (narrow 
down) the lateral triggering range of radar based WZIATs. This limita­
tion will help broaden the potential deployment application to include 
multi-lane highway work zones. Currently, radar based WZIATs would 
generate false positive alarms from multiple lanes (up to five) parallel to 
the closed work zone. 
5.3. Operational capability 
Operational guidelines for utilizing WZIATs in utility work zones 
most align with jurisdictional requirements, specifically those outlined 
in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Design (MUTCD) and state 
DOT guidelines. WZIATs should be integrated as an additional safety 
measure to enhance both driver and worker safety, not as a device that 
replaces existing traffic control devices. Although the use of WZIAT is 
expected to improve worker safety, there are some inherent risks asso­
ciated with using it. Similar to most traffic control devices, workers are 
exposed to potential struck-by incidents when deploying and removing 
WZIATs. Therefore, workers should be mindful of the associated hazards 
when using WZIATs as part of their traffic control setup. 
While the existing WZIATs are protected by a hard-shell case, the 
systems are not completely waterproof. WZIAT should be waterproof 
given that some utility work takes place during or after significant 
rainfalls. Having a water-resistant device will encourage contractors to 
adopt the technologies as they can use them throughout the year and not 
in only dry weather conditions, thereby improving the return on in­
vestment. Most of the current technologies have electronic components 
that are exposed to the elements, thereby making them sensitive to 
weather conditions such as rain. Additionally, it is essential for WZIAT 
system to have proactive battery management, including the availability 
of spare batteries, ensuring continuous device functionality, especially 
during extended utility operations exceeding a day. WZIATs should have 
battery level indicators on both the primary and secondary units. This 
will eliminate assumptions and guesses that could lead to a false nega­
tive (intrusion about to happen and the WZIAT system is not powered 
due to drained battery). 
The mobility of WZIATs is an important adoption factor given the 
inherent characteristics of electric utility work zones (short term, short 
duration work zones). Contractors will have to deploy and remove these 
technologies often; therefore, manufacturers should ensure that WZIATs 
are easy to move around and deploy. Providing a compact system will 
facilitate adoption and diffusion. The setup and operation process for 
WZIAT should be as simple as possible. Preferably, manufacturers 
should limit the need for and reliance on additional technologies such as 
internet, Bluetooth, and software apps. Work zones may be located in 
remote areas that have poor cell phone coverage. Moreover, the use of 
advanced technologies places an extra burden on end-users who may not 
be familiar with these technologies. 
6. Conclusions 
The number of work zone intrusions continues to increase, leading to 
roadway worker injuries and fatalities, as well as damage to equipment 
and property. This problem is especially relevant to utility work zones, 
as their short work durations and setup locations provide an added 
challenge to traffic control, and thus, the need for further protection is 
evident. The combination of current traffic control methods, like signs 
and channelizing devices, with existing and emerging work zone 
intrusion technologies, could be beneficial in improving safety in work 
zones. 
The present study identified critical risk factors associated with ac­
cidents in utility work zones. The study also identified several work zone 
intrusion technologies and evaluated their feasibility for utility work. 
The assessment led to the selection and evaluation of two tech­
nologies—AWARE and Alpha Safe Net. Live tests indicated positive 
perceptions among utility workers, especially in non-mobile operations. 
The study derived operational guidelines and a list of essential features 
for WZIATs in utility work zones based on insights generated from 
multiple sources. Overall, the research provides valuable insights and 
recommendations for enhancing safety in utility work zones through the 
deployment of effective WZIATs. It also identified WZIAT features which 
could be incorporated in future WZIAT design to reduce work zone in­
trusions in the utility industry. 
However, this study had some limitations. Six companies and 21 
individuals participated in the interviews, which could affect the 
generalizability of the results. The research team ensured representation 
from various types of companies in different geographical locations to 
limit potential bias. Future studies could improve generalizability by 
expanding the sample size. Additionally, the WZIATs was deployed on 
only one utility project, which may limit the generalizability of the 
findings. Future research should include a larger pool of test projects 
encompassing different types of activities and road geometries. This 
diversity could provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of WZI­
ATs in the utility industry. Despite these limitations, the present study 
offers unique insights that can enhance both research and practice at the 
intersection of worker safety and utility operations.
