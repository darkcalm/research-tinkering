HS interventions.
A last, but relevant, point is the need that HS of NIR exposed 
workers is performed by OM specialists with an adequate and updated competence and skill in this specific field, sometimes/often 
not sufficiently enhanced during the training.

RESEARCH AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH ACTIVITIES 
WITHIN THE PEROSH NETWORK
Louis Laurent
Institut National de Recherche et de Sécurité (INRS), France 
Most European countries carry out significant occupational health 
and safety research. Much of this is being conducted within the 
PEROSH network comprising 14 institutes. The 2023 PEROSH research conference, with its 80 presentations, together with an analysis of a number of other ongoing projects in Europe, provides a 
good overview of current issues. 
“Traditional" risks are still relevant. 
• 	 Some have long been known, such as those linked to asbestos, 
crystalline silica, carcinogenic substances or biological agents. 
The main aim of research is to gain a better understanding 
of workers' exposure to these hazards sometimes taking into 
account multiple factors. Some research on protective equipment, sometimes using innovative methods is also ongoing. 
• 	 In the field of chemical risk, a key development is the development of new approaches to analyze the hazards associated with 
chemical substances such as new in vitro tests metabolomics, 
or QSAR models, heralding a radical change in the way we 
work.
• 	 Other topics are more novel, from emerging pollutants, such as 
nanoplastics, to the impact of new technologies such as connected glasses, exoskeletons, cobotics and 3D printers. The 
evolution of these risks associated to green transition and climate change is still not widely covered, but it is likely that this 
subject will become increasingly important in the future.
A significant amount of work focuses on the impact of the upheavals 
that the world of work has undergone in recent years, in particular 
with the rise of information technologies, the profound changes 
in work organizations, one of which is the widespread use of teleworking since the pandemic, changes in demography and in the aspirations of society. 
• 	 As far as organizations are concerned, mainly psychosocial 
risks are addressed from the point of view of analyzing their 
effect, means of prevention and health effects. Musculoskeletal 
disorders are also covered. Among the topics investigated is 
the effects of telework, which is still a live issue, whether we 
are talking about the pandemic period or the current situation. 
A related topic is workplace organization, particularly the type 
of office. Another subject is the impact of algorithmic management, both in the case of working via a digital platform or of 
internal organization within the company. In addition, there is a 
wide diversity of more or less emerging organizations that can 
have an impact on employee health, and also modify the way in 
which preventive measures are implemented. 
• 	 Information technology also featured prominently, with presentations on artificial intelligence, a potential source of risk 
posing specific problems, but also a tool for research and prevention. Another phenomenon is the emergence of numerous 
miniature, low-cost sensors. Several presentations were devoted to the use of sensor networks designed to provide a better view of the risks to which workers are exposed, whether 
through multiple individual sensors or by mapping a hazard in 
the workplace.
Finally, it's worth mentioning one last research topic of interest. A 
reflection on how to deploy prevention actions and on their impact.

DEVELOPMENT, SUCCESS FACTORS, AND 
CHALLENGES OF “HEALTH AND PRODUCTIVITY 
MANAGEMENT” INITIATIVES IN JAPAN

1. 	
Rapid Population Aging in Japan: Japan’s working-age 
population is rapidly declining due to a decreasing birthrate 
and aging population. Consequently, extending the national 
retirement age is unavoidable to secure a workforce and 
maintain social security systems such as medical care and 
pensions. To enable employment for older individuals, it is 
essential to improve workers’ health and work fitness.
2. 	
Health and Productivity Management Initiatives in Japan: 
Well-designed workplace health promotion programs have 
demonstrated a positive return on investment by reducing 
sickness absence, and medical costs, and enhancing job 
satisfaction. In response, the Japanese government has embraced “health and productivity management” (HPM) as a 
policy initiative, encouraging corporations to regard health 
promotion activities as an investment in their employees’ 
health.
	
This initiative encompasses several programs, the core of 
which are the HPM recognition programs. These include 
the HPM Stock Selection Program and the Certified HPM 
Corporation Recognition Program consists of large and 
small-medium enterprise sectors. Participation in these 
programs has increased annually, and "health and productivity management" has become a well-known term among
