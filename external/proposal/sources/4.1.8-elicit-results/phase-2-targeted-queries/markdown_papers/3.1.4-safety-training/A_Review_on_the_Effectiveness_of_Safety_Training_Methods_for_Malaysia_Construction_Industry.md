Abstract 
Safety issues have become a vital issue in the management of facilities in the construction industry, as the 
labour-intensive construction industry is particularly regarded as one of the most unsafe industrial sectors 
worldwide. To increase workplace safety, Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) training has been 
introduced and pursued. Based on previous research, training methods range from less to more engaging.
This paper has reviewed the research from 2006 to present done on effectiveness of different training 
methods as the first investigation research was carried out in 2006. The literatures were searched through 
multiple electronic databases for published peer-reviewed articles. Findings have suggested that both 
training methods were able to impart safety knowledge and safety awareness to the workers; however, more 
engaging training methods would be more effective on training outcomes. Nevertheless, it was noted that 
those research projects did not take into consideration on the multiculturalism issue where language
communication problem exist. Hence, this research proposes a mix mode of less and more engaging training 
methods to be applied in a multi-cultural workplace to enhance the effectiveness of training outcomes. This 
review may provide information on effective safety training methods to be applied in the multi-cultural 
construction industry.

Abstrak 
Isu keselamatan kini telah menjadi tumpuan dalam pengurusan kemudahan dalam industri pembinaan di
mana industri pembinaan yang berintensifkan buruh dianggap sebagai satu sektor industri yang paling 
merbahaya di seluruh dunia. Untuk meningkatkan keselamatan di tempat kerja, latihan Occupational Safety 
and Health ( OSH ) telah diperkenalkan dan dijalankan, dan berdasarkan kajian terdahulu, kaedah latihan 
boleh dikategorikan dari kaedah yang kurang penglibatan kepada lebih penglibatan. Kajian ini mengkaji 
kajian terdahulu dari tahun 2006 hingga sekarang tentang keberkesanan kaedah latihan sebab kajian 
penilaian yang pertama adalah dijalankan pada tahun 2006. Kajian literatur dijalankan melalui pelbagai 
pangkalan data elektronik yang menerbitkan artikel berwasit. Hasil kajian mencadangkan bahawa keduadua kaedah latihan dapat memberikan pengetahuan dan kesedaran keselamatan kepada pekerja, namun 
kaedah latihan yang lebih penglibatan akan lebih berkesan kepada hasil latihan. Walau demikian, adalah 
ketara bahawa penyelidikan-penyelidikan tersebut tidak mengambil kira isu “multi-culturism” yang 
menyebabkan wujudnya masalah komunikasi bahasa. Oleh itu, kajian ini mencadangkan satu kaedah 
latihan mod campuran di antara kaedah kurang penglibatan dengan kaedah lebih penglibatan untuk
digunakan di tempat kerja yang “multi-culturism” untuk meningkatkan keberkesanan hasil latihan. Kajian 
ini boleh memberikan maklumat mengenai kaedah latihan keselamatan yang berkesan untuk diaplikasikan 
dalam industri pembinaan yang “multi-culturism”.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
Facility management can be defined as the integrated management 
of the workplace to enhance the performance of the organization. 
They also include some issues surrounding in the workplace such 
as quality, allocation, content, safety and health.1 Construction is a 
workplace and therefore improving the safety of the construction 
site is imperative. Safety is one of the most important elements in 
the workplace due to the sky-high fatality status around the globe 
and it has also became the concerned area in the management of 
facilities in workplace when safety issue is in the rising trend. 
Today, labour-intensive construction industry is regarded as one of 
the most unsafe industrial sectors worldwide. According ILO, at 
least 60,000 people are fatally injured in construction industry each 
year and many hundreds of thousands suffer serious injuries and 
ill-health. In fact, these numbers have been conservative. In many 
countries, less than 20 per cent of construction injuries are 
reported.2 Any loss of life as a result of an industrial accident is 
retrogressive in terms of human development and is therefore 
unacceptable, setting aside the cost for the accident. The increase 
in safety issues may in fact be controlled if the employees could 
behave safely with the provided safe and healthy workplace. 
However, failure to do so may lead to injury, loss of business, 
prosecution and insurance claims; later, the confidence of 
customers and investors in the business may also be affected. 
 Identification of causes and effects of the accident is an 
important prevention strategy to reduce the growing number of 
injuries and fatalities among workers. In order to improve the safety 
outcomes (fatality, accident and injury rate) of the construction 
industry, various research have been carry out to identify the factors 
affecting safety performance of the industry.3-4 
 Some research findings reveal that the human factor is one of 
the main contributor to poor safety performance.5-7 The human 
factor is related to the workers themselves and is connected to 
worker competency, behaviour, and awareness. According to 
Sawacha et al.4, accident incidents tend to be related to the lack of 
competency skills and knowledge of the workers to perform safety 
act in the workplace. Whereas some researchers argue that unsafe 
worker behaviour is frequently leads to unsafe acts on the 
workplace which causes accident.7-10 The competence safety 
knowledge and safety awareness of the workers could determine 
the behavioural of the workers because without the safety 
knowledge and awareness, they are unable to determine the proper 
behaviour to act in the workplace. When comes to decision making, 
the workers always unable to evaluate the risks for the actions taken 
and therefore, increase the risks of accident. 
 In order to increase workplace safety, Occupational Safety and 
Health (OSH) training has been introduced and pursued vigorously. 
The purpose of Health and Safety training is to impart safety 
knowledge and skill to the worker while shaping their safe work 
behaviours to reduce the workplace accident rate. Tam and Ivan11 
had identified safety training as one of the four most effective 
components of a safety programme. Following a survey of design 
and construction firms in Pennsylvania with 105 responses, Toole 
and Acse12 identified a lack of training as one of eight root causes 
of construction accidents. A similar analysis of 70 Thai 
construction projects found that safety inductions were effective in 
reducing unsafe conditions.13 By reviewing to the important status 
of safety training in reducing construction safety issues, high 
priority should be focused to ensure the effectiveness of the OSH 
training to raise the safety awareness level of the workers and 
shaping their safe work behaviour. 
 Several reviews have concluded that most training 
interventions have led to positive effects on safety knowledge, 
adoption of safe work behaviours and practices, and safety and 
health outcomes.14 Despite the fact that these safety training 
programs contribute to the safety level in the construction industry, 
research tends to enhance the outcome of the training through 
studies on the effectiveness of the safety training. Further study has 
focused to study the effectiveness of different safety and health 
training methods in imparting safety related knowledge and 
modelling safety behaviour.15-18 In response to answer the question, 
researchers have looked into the effectiveness of safety training 
between less engaging training method and more engaging training 
method in OSH training. However, to date, there is insufficient 
research to show the effectiveness of different safety and health 
training method. Hence the purpose of this paper is to review the 
studies on effectiveness of the safety training method to be applied 
in Malaysia OSH training. 
 The paper has been organized in the following ways: Section 
2 shows the methodology of literature collection for the research. 
Section 3 reviews on the effectiveness of different safety training 
method. Section 4 shows the analysis of findings on safety training 
literature. Section 5 proposes an effective OSH training method to 
be applied in Malaysia construction industry. Section 6 presents the 
conclusion and direction for future research. 

2.0 METHOD OF LITERATURE REVIEW ON SAFETY 
TRAINING 
 
A systematic search of the academic literature was conducted, 
including studies of any empirical research design that evaluated 
the methods use in safety training. The data collection phase of the 
literature review involved search in multiple electronic databases 
(Scopus, Science Direct, Pro Quest, Web of Science and Emerald) 
for published peer-reviewed articles evaluating the effectiveness of 
safety training. 
 Searches were conducted using selected keywords: safety 
training, effective training, mode of training (‘lecture’; ‘video’; 
‘feedback’; ‘demonstration’; ‘active’; ‘passive’ and etc.), accident 
prevention, levels of training engagement (‘least engaging’; 
‘moderate engaging’ and ‘most engaging’) and occupational 
hazards. The selected keywords were in fact chosen from some of 
the keyword supplied by the authors in the same relevant studies. 
The focus of this review was the academic literature from 2006 to 
the present. The rationale behind this was because the first 
investigation on the effectiveness of different OSH training method 
was carried out in 2006, and the most latest research was necessary 
to took into consideration because it reflected the most current 
situation in today. The abstracts, methods sections, and lists of 
references of the resulting publications were read to identify 
instruments for potential inclusion in this review. Subsequent 
literature searches were carried out with the title of each instrument 
entered into the search field. The resulting instruments were 
screened for inclusion in this review. 

3.0 REVIEW ON THE SAFETY TRAINING METHOD 
 
Methods of safety and health training range from less engaging 
training method to more engaging training method.15 Less engaging 
training method means the training that has less involvement or 
inactive interaction between trainer and trainee. The examples 
include lectures with minimal interaction, videos, pamphlets, 
manuals without exercises, computer instruction with no 
interaction or feedback and discussion. Meanwhile, more engaging 
training method refers to training that involves an application of the 
concepts from the training content in a real or simulated 
environment. Examples include behavioural modelling, hands-on 
training (including simulated or actual work environments), or 
virtual reality training.

The first research on assessing the relative effectiveness of different 
methods of worker safety and health training was conducted by 
Burke et al.15 which included 95 studies published from 1971 to 
2003. Their findings showed that both less and more engaging 
training methods were able to improve the behavioural 
performance among the trainees. However, when the training 
methods became more engaging, namely requiring trainees’ active 
participation, the workers demonstrated greater knowledge 
acquisition and reductions were seen in accidents. 
 Other similar research was conducted by Robson et al.16 as a 
follow-up on a study on the effectiveness of safety training and 
reviews the research that was previously conducted by Burke et 
al.15. Robson’s research indicated that it is indeed true that safety 
training is effective in altering worker behaviour. However, as 
mentioned in his review to the previous study, there is potential for 
being bias for self-selecting the data in the process of their study. 
His finding has shown contradiction with previous research15 on 
the effectiveness of the mode of training towards knowledge, 
attitude and health.16 He pinpointed there is insufficient evidence 
showing that high engagement of training is more effective than 
medium/low engagement training on the training outcomes. It is 
also shown in his research that, in a single session of training, there 
is insufficient evidence to see the difference in term of training 
effect between the high engagement training and low/medium 
engagement training. 
 Burke et al.17 expanded their study by covering 113 studies, 
confirming their previous results and then retorting the findings of 
Robson et al.16. As mentioned earlier, the conclusions reached in 
Burke et al.15 were brought into question by Robson et al.16, where 
they concluded that their review team found insufficient evidence 
of high engagement training having a greater impact on 
occupational safety and health-related behaviours compared to 
low/medium engagement training. However, Burke et al.17 found 
that the relative effectiveness of less versus highly engaging forms 
of safety training were stronger and more robust than the respective 
uncorrected study effects reported in Robson et al.16 These findings 
were in the contrary with the finding of Robson et al.16 and 
according to Burke et al.17 these differences in findings were due 
to the highly selective sampling of studies and second-order 
sampling error introduced in Robson et al.16 Furthermore, the 
findings of Burke et al.17 also showed that highly engaging training 
was considerably more effective than less engaging training when 
hazardous event/exposure severity was high, whereas highly and 
less engaging training had comparable levels of effectiveness when 
hazardous event/exposure severity was low. 
The research of Burke et al.17 was then followed by a most recent 
research carried out by Brahm and Singer18 in this relevant field. 
According to Brahm and Singer18, although Burke et al.17 has 
expanded their sample of study to show their corollary on greater 
engaging methods of training will always be more effective than 
non-engaging training approaches. Yet the result is still 
questionable as the additional studies do not assure that the new 
study properly addresses the question of methodology posed by 
Robson et al.16 in the earlier research. He further commented the 
previous researches on the effectiveness on the mode of study could 
be contested on methodological ground. Instead of solely deciding 
on a single training method, Brahm and Singer18 proposed the 
selection of training methods by firms may be contingent on their 
stage of OSH capabilities and commitment. They stressed that no 
single training method should be superior to any other. They further 
elaborated that training should progress by stage of first using 
rationalistic and less engaging methods to transfer declarative 
knowledge and then shifting to more engaging methods to transfer 
procedural knowledge.18 

4.0 ANALYSIS OF SAFETY TRANIINNG LITERATURE 
 
Commonly, OSH training has been delivered using low engaging 
method (lectures and notes) in Malaysia construction industry. 
However, results has shown low engaging training which is 
common in construction, has consistently been shown to be 
minimally effective when compared with more engaging forms of 
instruction .15-16,19-20 Burke et al.17 has carry further depth review 
on the previous researches by considering the level occupational 
hazards. The result supports the findings from previous researches, 
particularly when the severity level of hazardous event/ exposure is 
high.17 When hazardous event/exposure severity is low, less 
engaging training approaches appear to be as effective as those that 
are highly engaging 16 
 Nevertheless, it is notably that these researches did not appear 
to show the indicator of multi-cultural in related to the effectiveness 
of the training module towards the workers on safety awareness and 
behavioural modelling. Multi-culturalism is becoming a common 
scenario in construction field for most of the countries as their 
labour workforce is depending heavily on the foreign workers. 
Those previous findings may not necessary suitable to be applied 
on multi-cultural workplace. 
 Multi-culturalism is an increasingly prominent feature of the 
construction industry. Multicultural teams are used because they 
are perceived to out-perform monoculture teams.21 The shift 
towards multi-cultural is a trend for those international construction 
companies that tend to enhance their working performance and 
going global development. Besides, there is also another factor that 
promotes multi-cultural in construction industry. In certain 
countries (Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and Kuwait), foreign 
workers have become the main stream of workforce in construction 
industry as the profession were not favourable by locals.22-24 It 
should be notably that language issue has been identified as the 
greatest barrier to the smooth integration of migrants into a 
workforce.25 The consequences of mis-managing cultural diversity 
are serious and it would increase stress among the workforce, 
confusion, frustration and conflict which translates into lower 
morale, productivity, quality problems and higher accident rates.2628 Trajkovski and Loosemore25 further pointed out the difficulties 
of foreign workers (Non-English Speaking Background, NESB 
migrant) in understanding the content of the mandatory 
government safety accreditation courses/training due to language 
barrier. 
 Construction industry demand massive manpower for the 
workloads, labour supplies are essential, and have become the most 
expensive resource deployed within the industry.29-30 According to 
Pillai31, Malaysian construction sector has become the most 
significant reliance on foreign worker among Asian country. 
Foreign construction workers (unskilled and semi-skilled migrant 
workers) in Malaysia were from adjacent regions; Indonesia is the 
leading source of labour, followed by Myanmar, Pakistan, India, 
and the Philippines. The quality of foreign workers in term of 
working skill is the weakness of the list in exchange for cheaper 
manpower in the industry. According to Han et al.32, most of the 
foreign workers arriving in Malaysia are unskilled, which has 
reduced the productivity and the quality control within the 
construction industry. Moreover, an unskilled foreign worker will 
contribute to a significant amount of safety related issues, as are 
lack safety knowledge and safety awareness. 
 Therefore, it is fundamental to establish an effective training 
to impart necessary knowledge and skills before tasks could be 
assigned. However, there exists language communication problem 
in a multi-cultural workplace, and the statistics have shown that 
most of the workers have low education background, thus putting 
into question on the applicability of the findings in previous 
research on the effectiveness of different OSH training method

when language barrier in multi-cultural is an issue in the 
construction industry. 

5.0 PROPOSED EFFECTIVE TRAINING METHOD IN 
MALAYSIA CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY 
 
As mentioned earlier, the existing OSH training method in 
Malaysia is less engaging method meanwhile the previous studies 
suggest that more engaging method would deliver a better result for 
the training outcome. Both less and more engaging training 
methods are able to impart safety knowledge and safety awareness 
to the workers. However the effectiveness of both training methods 
would vary according to different circumstances. According to 
Michel et al.33, educator should considers which areas of their 
subject matter are best suited for the active learning approach 
(referring to more engaging training methods), in order to 
supplement those areas where the passive approach (referring to 
less engaging training methods) works best. So, to ensure an 
effective OSH training, the training institution should revise the 
existing training method in order to enhance training objectives as 
each training method has its own pros and cons. 
 It is doubtful whether foreign workers could understand the 
content of safety training delivered solely using single training 
method, not to mention shaping their safe work behaviour through 
the training. The purpose of having Safety and Health training is to 
help people to learn about safety knowledge and skill to the worker 
while shaping their safe work behaviours. Thus, it would be 
meaningless if safety training failed to enable the workers to 
understand the content of the training meant to impart the safety 
knowledge and skill to the worker and build up safety awareness. 
 It is noticeably that less engaging method (e.g. lectures, notes 
and video) enables educator to present a large amount of material 
in a relatively brief amount of time. Within the lecture period, 
educator is able to impart a significant amount of basic knowledge 
to the ‘freshies’ to form a better foundation of learning. However, 
becoming solely dependent on less engaging methods may end up 
in ineffective safety training as foreign workers may not be able to 
understand what has been taught in the lectures. 
 The effectiveness of OSH training would further be enhanced 
if the more engaging training is applied after less engaging training. 
The declarative and basic safety knowledge are recommended to 
deliver by using less engaging training method follow by a more 
engaging training method where the trainees are required to applied 
the knowledge in a real or stimulated environment. More engaging 
training may further enhance the output of safety training as 
workers are given chances to apply the knowledge acquired on the 
practices provided in the safety training with guidance from 
trainers. Language communication problems may cause the 
workers to be unable to fully understand the content delivered using 
less engaging training method; meanwhile, follow-up training 
using more engaging method would enhance their understanding as 
trainees would be exposed with practical and self-experiences. 
 
Therefore, by reviewing previous research, this research 
proposes that mix mode of less and more engaging training 
methods may be more suitable for OSH training in Malaysia 
construction industry which consists of multi-cultural labours. 

6.0 CONCLUSIONS AND DIRECTION FOR FUTURE 
RESEARCH 
 
In conclusion, both training methods are able to impart the 
knowledge and safety awareness to the workers, however the 
effectiveness of both training method would vary according to the 
different circumstances. When comes to the issue of language 
communication problem in Malaysia construction industry, it is 
important to ensure the training method delivered in OSH training 
enables the workers to understand the content of the training and 
apply in real life. A single mode of training module would not be 
superior to another in effectively delivering the safety knowledge 
and awareness to the worker while modeling safe work behaviour. 
Thus, this research suggests that a mix mode of less and more 
engaging training methods would achieve better results in terms of 
effectiveness of OSH training in the Malaysia construction 
industry. It is recommended that the future researches could carry 
out experimental study to further examine the effectiveness of mix 
mode training method in OSH training in Malaysia construction 
industry.
