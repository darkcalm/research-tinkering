Abstract
Objectives. We sought to determine the relative effectiveness of
different methods of worker safety and health training aimed at

improving safety knowledge and performance and reducing
negative outcomes (accidents, illnesses, and injuries).
Methods. Ninety-five quasi-experimental studies (n=20991) were
included in the analysis. Three types of intervention methods were
distinguished on the basis of learners’ participation in the training
process: least engaging (lecture, pamphlets, videos), moderately
engaging (programmed instruction, feedback interventions), and
most engaging (training in behavioral modeling, hands-on training).
Results. As training methods became more engaging (i.e., requiring
trainees’ active participation), workers demonstrated greater
knowledge acquisition, and reductions were seen in accidents,
illnesses, and injuries. All methods of training produced meaningful
behavioral performance improvements.
Conclusions. Training involving behavioral modeling, a substantial
amount of practice, and dialogue is generally more effective than
other methods of safety and health training. The present findings
challenge the current emphasis on more passive computer-based
and distance training methods within the public health workforce.
An understanding of how best to implement worker safety and
health training is a critical public need in light of the tragic events
of September 11, 2001, as well as ongoing efforts to prepare
emergency responders and professionals in related areas to do their
jobs safely and effectively.1 The need to gain a better
understanding of the effectiveness of safety and health training is
also apparent in a broader context given that millions of injuries
and illnesses are reported annually in private industry workplaces,2
and health and safety training is globally recognized as 1 means of
reducing the costs associated with such events.3 Indeed, researchers
from different fields, including business, psychology, engineering,
and public health, have long recognized the need for
comprehensive, systematic evaluations of safety and health training
to address these types of critical public- and private-sector
concerns.4–7
The conclusion from several narrative reviews has been that most
training interventions lead to positive effects on safety knowledge,

adoption of safe work behaviors and practices, and safety and
health outcomes.5,8,9 However, these qualitative reviews are
speculative as to the specific factors that enhance the relative
effectiveness of safety and health training interventions in reducing
or preventing worker injury or illness.10–12 Notably, a fundamental
question remains unresolved within the scientific literature: What is
the relative effectiveness of different methods of safety and health
training in modifying safety-related knowledge, behavior, and
outcomes?
Attempts to address similar broad-based questions related to the
benefits of work-related health and safety interventions13 have
revealed the need for a large-scale, quantitative analysis of the
extant literature. Results from such an analysis would not only help
improve safety and health training programs but also provide
evidence of the benefits of these programs, securing both new and
continued support from the public as well as the private sector.
With these ends in mind, this study was designed to metaanalytically examine the effectiveness of different types of worker
safety and health training, across industries and occupations, from
1971 to the present. In the section to follow, we describe different
methods of worker safety and health training and offer hypotheses
concerning the relative effectiveness of these methods.
SAFETY AND HEALTH TRAINING
STRATEGIES
Methods of safety and health training range from passive,
information-based techniques (e.g., lectures) to computer-based,
programmed instruction and learner-centered, performance-based
techniques (e.g., hands-on demonstrations). Lectures, one of the
least engaging methods of safety and health training, are commonly
used to present health- and safety-related information. Other
common passive techniques include videos and pamphlets or other
types of written materials.
Methods of training that can be categorized as moderately engaging
incorporate knowledge of results, for example feedback

interventions in which performance information is provided in
small groups, allowing learners to correct their mistakes. Feedback
is also a characteristic of programmed instruction, a method of
training designed to present information in a standardized manner,
such as on a personal computer or in a workbook format. An
extensively used moderately engaging method, computer-based
instruction, has been created for the entire gamut of work-place
health and safety topics, including occupational safety, industrial
safety, systems safety, fire protection, hazardous materials and
waste disposal and storage, industrial hygiene, risk management,
and safety engineering and design.14
The most engaging methods of safety and health training focus on
the development of knowledge in stages15 and emphasize
principles of behavioral modeling.16 Behavioral modeling involves
observation of a role model, modeling or practice, and feedback
designed to modify behavior. These methods also include hands-on
demonstrations associated with behavioral simulations, which
require active participation from the trainee.
In the case of behavioral simulations and hands-on training,
interactions between trainees and trainers will frequently go beyond
1-way feedback to engage trainees in dialogue concerning
knowledge acquired or actions taken. Such dialogue, in either a
virtual or actual context, is important because it is posited to
enhance quality of reflection (thinking) with respect to actions
taken.17–19 This action-focused reflection is regarded as the key to
knowledge acquisition and transfer of training, in that it forces the
trainee to infer causal and conditional relations between events and
actions, leading to development of strategies for handling
unforeseen events and initiating and promoting self-regulatory
motivational processes (e.g., self-monitoring and self-efficacy
expectations).
Consistent with these arguments, there is ample evidence in the
training literature that active approaches to learning are superior to
less active approaches.20 Therefore, as training moves along the
continuum from more passive information-based methods (e.g.,
lectures) to the most engaging methods (e.g., behavioral modeling
and hands-on demonstrations), we hypothesize that greater

knowledge acquisition and more transfer of training to the work
setting will occur (thereby improving behavioral safety performance
and reducing negative safety and health outcomes).
METHODS
Search and Inclusion Criteria
We identified relevant studies published between 1971 (i.e.,
subsequent to passage of the US Occupational Safety and Health Act
of 1970 [29 USC §651–678]) and 2003 by searching the Psyc Info,
Pub Med, and ABI-Inform electronic databases using phrases such as
“health and safety training,” “safety training intervention,” and
“error management and intervention.” In addition, we manually
searched 19 journals and the reference sections of relevant
publications. This process yielded 709 studies from a wide variety
of fields, including occupational medicine, industrial hygiene,
management, and applied psychology. We assessed all reports of an
empirical nature to determine whether they met our criteria for
inclusion in the meta-analysis.
Inclusion criteria were as follows. First, the study had to involve a
quasi-experimental design (i.e., a study approximating a true
experiment but not allowing for control of all relevant variables
because of its field setting).21 Second, participants had to be
recruited from a working population (this population could include
youth workers). Third, the method of intervention (e.g., lecture,
programmed instruction, behavioral modeling, or simulation) had
to be clearly identified and had to involve the development of jobrelevant safety knowledge.
Fourth, the study was required to include at least 1 of the following
types of dependent variables: safety knowledge (i.e., self-rating or
test of knowledge), safety performance (i.e., self-ratings or
supervisor, coworker, or observer ratings of safety-related
behavior), or safety and health outcome (i.e., measure of accidents,
illnesses, or injuries). Fifth, the training intervention and data had
to be assessed at the individual level of analysis. Finally, the
statistical information necessary to calculate an effect size (d ) had
to be available. A large number of studies were excluded because

### Page 24

they contained inadequate statistical information or were not field
experiments of health and safety training effectiveness. Of the
originally identified 709 studies, 95 met the inclusion criteria.
Coding of Studies
An extensive coding protocol was developed to include the
following information: (1) method of safety and health training, (2)
duration of training, (3) dependent variable (i.e., safety knowledge,
behavioral safety performance, or safety and health outcomes) used
in all posttraining assessments, (4) reliability of dependent variable,
(5) occupational classification, and (6) country of study. All
reliability estimates22 (i.e., estimates of the consistency with which
variables were measured) for knowledge tests were internal
consistency estimates23 (i.e., α coefficients), and the majority of
reliability estimates for the performance measures were interrater
estimates (e.g., correlation between 2 trained observers’ assessments
of workers’ performance).
In terms of classification of training methods, lectures, films, and
video-based training were classified as the least engaging methods;
programmed instruction techniques, including computer-based
instruction and feedback techniques, were classified as moderately
engaging training methods; and behavioral modeling, simulation,
and hands-on training were categorized as the most engaging
training methods. All study characteristics pertaining to hypothesis
tests were double coded; disagreements between coders were settled
by the first author.
Statistical Analyses
Initially, we computed d statistics using the procedures described by
Shadish and colleagues24 and Lipsey and Wilson.25 In the case of
studies in which gains or losses because of training were expressed
as a proportion or a percentage, we estimated d statistics via an
arcsine transformation, which results in a conservative estimate of d
values.25
Subsequently, we employed the Raju et al.26 meta-analysis
procedure because this procedure allows effects to be corrected for

---


### Page 25

unreliability associated with the dependent variable. Such
corrections produce more accurate estimates of population-level
effects and permit more appropriate comparisons of mean effects
across different types of dependent variables.27 In our set of
studies, mean reliability values weighted according to sample size
were 0.67 for safety knowledge, 0.86 for safety performance, and
0.96 for safety-related outcomes. Notably, the Raju et al. procedure
allows computation of asymptotically derived standard errors for
mean corrected (disattenuated) correlations in fixed-effect and
random-effect forms.28 Therefore, before using this procedure, we
transformed d statistics to correlations via maximum-likelihood
estimates.27
For most studies that reported multiple effects within our
dependent variable categories (e.g., effects for 2 dimensions of
behavioral performance), we computed an average effect. In a few
exceptions, we judged 1 effect more appropriate (e.g., because it
was based on a more clearly defined dependent variable), and we
included this effect in our analyses. This procedure ensured
independence of study effects within any particular effect size
distribution.
A number of effect sizes for combinations of training method and
dependent variable were based on within-subject designs. To
examine the possible effects of study design on our results, we
conducted separate meta-analyses of studies involving withinsubject designs and studies involving between-subjects designs (we
also conducted separate analyses for distributions that included
both types of study designs). In addition, because of the lack of
pretraining information in many studies, effects for betweensubjects studies were based on posttest-only comparisons of control
and training groups. In a few cases in which the control or
comparison group was non-comparable (e.g., the groups had
different amounts of work experience) or the comparison group was
trained with a less engaging method than the focal trained group
(and in which pretraining and posttraining data were available),
study effects were based on within-subject data for the trained
group or groups.

Table 2 ▶ presents the results of tests of our hypotheses based on
data gathered within the first posttraining assessment. For reporting
purposes, mean effect sizes (d statistics), along with number of
effects (k) and total sample sizes (n) pertaining to hypothesis tests,
are presented for (1) studies involving between-subjects designs, (2)
studies involving within-subject designs, and (3) the combined
(overall) distributions of effects. As a result of the complex nature
of r-to-d transformations for d values in our overall analysis (which
generally fell outside the straightforward transformation range for d
of −0.41 to 0.41),27 limits of the confidence intervals for the mean
effects and variances of effect size distributions are presented only
in correlation (r) form in Table 3 ▶.

The findings reported in Table 2 ▶ are consistent with the
expectation that the more engaging a method of training, the
greater the effects of safety and health training on knowledge
acquisition. Overall, mean knowledge acquisition effect sizes for the
least engaging, moderately engaging, and the most engaging safety
training interventions (for both types of study designs combined)
were 0.55, 0.74, and 1.46, respectively. As indicated by the
confidence intervals for these effects (Table 3 ▶), the effects were
significantly different from each other. Furthermore, although
training durations were, on average, greater in the case of more
engaging training methods, training duration and level of
engagement were only weakly (and nonsignificantly) associated in
the knowledge category studies (as well as the performance
category studies). These findings rule out training duration and a
strict observational learning effect as a plausible rival explanation
for the present results.124
A small subset of studies (i.e., 7) that included knowledge measures
allowed us to examine maintenance or decay in terms of the
effectiveness of safety training. In 5 studies involving training at
low levels of engagement, the average effect decreased
approximately 50% (i.e., from 0.55 to 0.28) during periods ranging
from 1 week to 1 year after the initial assessment. The effect in the
lone study involving moderately engaging training decreased
approximately 15% (from 3.37 to 2.85) over 4 weeks, and the effect
in the single study involving highly engaging training was
maintained at 1.84 over a 4-week period. More research and better
reporting of primary study results are needed before definitive
conclusions can be reached about decay of safety and health

training effectiveness over time.
With respect to improvements in behavioral safety performance, the
mean overall effects associated with safety and health training
interventions in the least engaging, moderately engaging, and most
engaging categories were 0.63, 0.62, and 0.74, respectively.
Although these effects were not significantly different from each
other, it is notable that the confidence interval for the latter effect
was predominantly outside the range of the respective confidence
intervals for the effects of the least engaging and moderately
engaging training methods.
Our findings are generally consistent with the expectation that as
level of engagement in training increases, training will have greater
effects in terms of reductions in negative safety and health
outcomes. For the overall distributions, the mean effects associated
with the least engaging, moderately engaging, and the most
engaging safety and health training methods were 0.20, −0.13, and
−0.48, respectively, and these effects were significantly different
from each other. It should be noted that the least engaging and
moderately engaging distributions were each influenced greatly by
a single study involving a large sample size and a small effect.
DISCUSSION
Here we assessed theoretical expectations concerning the relative
effectiveness of different methods of worker safety and health
training aimed at modifying safety-related knowledge, behaviors,
and outcomes. This is the first investigation focusing on such
training, to our knowledge, that has included all studies published
since 1971 and has involved a scientifically rigorous approach.
Although the number of studies examining illnesses, injuries, and
accidents was not sufficient to allow separate consideration of these
categories of safety and health outcomes, the quality of the
database was adequate for testing general hypotheses.
As mentioned, our results are consistent with the proposition that as
the method of safety and health training becomes more engaging,
the effect of training is greater in terms of knowledge acquisition
and reductions in negative outcomes. Our results concerning

---


### Page 38

behavioral performance were more equivocal but nevertheless
provided consistent support, in the case of both between-subjects
and within-subject study designs, for the effectiveness of more
engaging training methods. Together, these findings address calls
for research on safety and health interventions, including those of
the National Occupational Research Agenda.10–12,125 More
specifically, our results speak to the goals of the intervention
effectiveness research agenda, including not only what interventions
are most effective in enhancing worker safety and health but also
why they are effective.
Our findings indicate that the most engaging methods of safety
training are, on average, approximately 3 times more effective than
the least engaging methods in promoting knowledge and skill
acquisition. An alternative way to differentiate the effects of the
most engaging methods on knowledge gain from the effects of other
methods is to compute “common language” effect sizes.126 In a
given study, the probability of a randomly selected individual from
the most engaging training group exceeding a randomly selected
individual from the least engaging training group in terms of
knowledge acquired was 0.74; the analogous probability was 0.70
in a comparison of randomly selected individuals from the most
engaging and moderately engaging groups. The magnitudes of such
differences alone have broad organizational and public policy
implications for the manner in which safety and health training—in
particular, mandated training—is delivered.
Unexpectedly, the least, moderate, and most engaging safety and
health training methods had somewhat comparable overall mean
levels of effectiveness with respect to improvements in behavioral
performance. We cautiously interpret this pattern of results to be a
function of the fact that the training methods classified as least
engaging and moderately engaging were often associated with more
fundamental, routine types of tasks (e.g., applying sunscreen,
inserting hearing devices, keeping work areas clear of obstacles),
whereas the methods classified as most engaging often involved
advanced, complex work activities (e.g., properly handling needles
to avoid exposure to blood-borne pathogens, selecting and using
respirators to avoid neurotoxic exposures). We suspect that
differences in the complexity of performance tasks, coupled with

---


### Page 39

suboptimal measures of more complex tasks, influenced our
results.4,127
Our findings indicate that the most engaging methods of safety
training are, on average, most effective in reducing negative
outcomes such as accidents. The greater effectiveness of more
engaging, hands-on training in reducing negative outcomes and
increasing knowledge acquisition lends support to the calls of
researchers and practitioners advocating the design and
implementation of learner-centered, participatory approaches to
worker safety and health training,74,128–130 and such a finding is
consistent with the results of previous meta-analytic studies of
training evaluation in other domains.131 Furthermore, our findings
are consistent with recommendations in other areas of the literature
advocating for the active involvement of workers so that the
advanced knowledge necessary for fault prevention can be
developed (e.g., anticipatory responses to problem situations in
manufacturing contexts).132,133
In a broader sense, the present results provide guidance for the
design and delivery of educational interventions targeted toward
the public health workforce.134–136 Efforts to increase the capacity
of this workforce as well as the capacity of the public to respond to
threats, react to emergency events, and simply engage in safe
behavior must be achieved, in part, through continued education
programs.1,137–139 Designing and implementing effective training
is central to these efforts.
Our results have important implications that should be considered
in light of the current push toward greater use of distance learning
training in preparing the public health workforce.140–143 Our
findings suggest that, to the extent possible, computer-based and
distance learning methods should, in some manner, include active
participation on the part of learners (e.g., modeling, feedback, and
dialogue) to enhance their knowledge acquisition and increase their
preparedness. To date, most computer-based and distance safety
training has been rather passive, including directional feedback
rather than facilitating the types of dialogue that would engender
action-focused reflection.144 Our recommendations concerning
active worker participation and dialogue as accompaniments to

---


### Page 40

computer-based and distance learning methods of health and safety
training are fully consistent with theoretical models concerning
distance learning and education.145,146
Another important finding of this study relevant to the design and
evaluation of safety and health training was that between-subjects
and within-subject study designs yielded similar results with respect
to knowledge acquisition. Despite cautionary issues concerning
potential threats to the internal and external validity of withinsubject study designs,147 our results demonstrate that studies
involving such designs provide theoretically interpretable findings
that are consistent with findings from between-subjects studies in
the domain of worker safety and health training. Given that withinsubject designs generally involve greater statistical power than
between-subjects designs27 and that withholding safety and health
training from a comparison group (or locating a control/comparison
group) for the purpose of program evaluation is often ethically
questionable in safety-related work, our findings encourage greater
use of within-subject designs in evaluating safety and health
training.
The meta-analytic results described here are also necessary building
blocks for any effort aimed at estimating the incremental costs or
benefits of different types of safety and health training.148 Such
information is particularly important given today’s increased
pressures to justify and improve health and safety investments.12
Our results suggest that moderately and highly engaging training
methods are, on average, more time consuming and probably more
expensive in the short term but that they are potentially less costly
and more effective in the long term while better ensuring worker
and public safety.
In addition, the trends in the magnitudes of our results across
dependent variable categories are consistent with predictions from
job performance theories. Job performance theories posit that
interventions (e.g., safety and health training) are expected to have
their greatest impact on more proximal outcome variables such as
knowledge acquisition and their least impact on more distal, lowbase-rate phenomena such as accidents. The reasoning is that
knowledge acquisition is expected to mediate the relationships

---


### Page 41

between such interventions and their more distal outcomes.8,149
Accordingly, in evaluating the effectiveness of interventions, safety
and health training researchers and practitioners need to focus
much more on the development of well-designed, standardized
measures of safety knowledge. Furthermore, because training effects
for relatively distal outcomes such as on-the-job performance and
injuries are likely to be more affected by intervening, time-related
variables than training effects for relatively proximal measures such
as knowledge assessments, we stress the need for future research
examining the influence of situational variables (i.e., organizational
safety climate, opportunities to apply knowledge and skills, type of
work, country/culture, and so on)150,151 on safety and health
training effectiveness.
We also encourage future primary empirical research addressing
some of the limitations of the present meta-analysis (e.g., primary
studies related to distributions with small numbers of effects).
Moreover, we encourage primary and meta-analytic research
designed to extend our study and examine safety and health
training relative to more specific safety knowledge, safety
performance, and safety and health outcome variables, in addition
to examining the role of individual difference variables (e.g.,
worker motivation, work experience). Our future success in
promoting safe work behaviors and reducing the negative
consequences of unsafe behaviors will largely depend on our ability
to improve our conceptualizations and communications of the
effectiveness of safety and health training interventions.
