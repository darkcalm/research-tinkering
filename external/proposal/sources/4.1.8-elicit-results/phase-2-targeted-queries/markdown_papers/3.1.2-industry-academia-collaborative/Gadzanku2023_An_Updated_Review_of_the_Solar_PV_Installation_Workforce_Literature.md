In order to develop a well-trained, equitable, and inclusive workforce
with high quality jobs, the DOE Solar Energy Technologies Office
(SETO) identified a need for analytical context around different PV
project characteristics and labor aspects, and how they might impact
workforce wellbeing and PV industry growth. To determine the most
valuable novel analytical contributions, this work reviews existing
literature on solar workforce topics to identify what areas have been
studied previously and where gaps remain. Focus areas included
the following topics: (1) metrics for solar workforce, deployment,
costs, and associated studies capturing aspects such as
demographics and regional distribution, (2) solar workforce
wellbeing, including employee contracting mechanisms,
compensation, occupational safety and health, and community
impacts, (3) national and state policies most relevant to the U.S.
solar workforce, and (4) ongoing efforts to expand solar workforce
participation, including local staffing dynamics, challenges, and
relevant strategies.
