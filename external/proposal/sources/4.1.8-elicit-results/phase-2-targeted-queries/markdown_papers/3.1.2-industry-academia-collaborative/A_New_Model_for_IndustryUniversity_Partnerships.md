C
alifornia Water Service Co. (Cal Water), San José, Calif., has 
made a $450,000, five-year pledge to San José State University 
(SJSU) to support research that will help provide solutions to 
various challenges facing the water industry. This opportunity 
will allow industry professionals and university representatives 
to work together on real business issues within the water utility sector. 
Through this research partnership project, seven critical (top-tier) projects 
that are aligned with both corporate goals and key business and industry 
concerns will be carried out to help address knowledge-base gaps in the 
drinking water industry and research community over a 4.5-year period. It 
was mutually agreed that hands-on exchange and interaction, publication 
efforts, outreach, and the visibility of research outcomes should be emphasized. Also of utmost importance is that research outcomes be considered 
within both practical and applied contexts to ensure broad industry effects 
and transference. The spring 2015 issue of SJSU’s Engineering at San José 
State–Charles W. Davidson College of Engineering magazine highlighted 
this project in detail (see the photograph on page 85). In this article, the 
decision-making process used to formulate the seven critical research projects is described.
A RESEARCH PARTNERSHIP 
BETWEEN THE CALIFORNIA 
WATER SERVICE CO. AND SAN

BACKGROUND
Cal Water, through its subsidiaries, serves as both a regulated and 
nonregulated water utility and provides other services in California, 
Washington, New Mexico, and 
Hawaii. Key service elements include 
the production, purchase, storage, 
treatment, testing, distribution, and 
sale of water for domestic, industrial, 
public, and irrigation uses as well as for 
fire protection. Within California 
spe cifically, water service is provided 
to roughly 478,000 customers—about 
1.7 million people—located in 83 
statewide communities. The key infrastructure components that support 
this customer base consist of about 
5,700 mi of water main, 134,400 line 
and control valves, 970 booster stations, 650 wells, seven surface water 
treatment plants, 420 water storage 
fa cilities, and 450 supervisory control 
and data acquisition transmitting units.
Given the broad range of technical, legal, financial, social, and environmental factors that accompany 
managing a utility of its size and 
complexity, Cal Water has embraced 
the underlying philosophy and tenets 
of effective utility management. This 
management framework was developed in 2008 by a consortium of 
water-related entities and focuses on 
10 core management elements, all of 
which deeply affect Cal Water’s corporate vision, structure, mandate, 
and daily operations. These elements 
are water resource adequacy, product quality, customer satisfaction, 
employee and leadership development, operational optimization, 
financial viability, infrastructure stability, operational resilience, community sustainability, and stakeholder understanding and support.
To explore as well as more effectively incorporate several effective 
utility management elements into 
Cal Water’s culture and operations, 
the company embarked on developing and implementing an industry–
university exchange program with 
SJSU in 2014. This program is 
designed to allow academic and 
industry representatives to work 
closely together on real business 
issues. Some of the principal outcomes that both entities envision 
(and will enjoy) from this exchange 
program include the following:
• An improved understanding of 
key physical processes that 
occur within Cal Water’s infrastructure system that can lead 
to better life-cycle planning, 
analysis, design, and operational decision-making
• Improved business intelligence 
that springs from complete lifecycle considerations of data architecture, collection, warehousing, 
and postprocessing (analytics)
• Additional opportunities to 
rationally plan and optimize 
capital and operational projects 
and programs
• Additional opportunities to 
improve product quality
• Improved general rate case and 
other stakeholder and public 
processes as they pertain to 
project and program identification, evaluation, justification, 
and presentation
Cal Water believes that the new or 
additional considerations that result 
from this research will constitute 
“value-added” development to its 
overall corporate and business processes and, by extension, that these 
values and benefits can be passed 
on to a variety of stakeholders and 
constituents.
DECISION-MAKING PROCESS
Between the beginning of August 
2014 and mid-March 2015, 24 
meetings were held between staff 
from Cal Water and faculty from 
SJSU. These meetings included three 
major team meetings and one progress update meeting with executive

The California Water Service Co.–San José State 
University partnership is designed to allow 
academic and industry representatives to work 
closely together on real business issues.

Juneseok Lee. Cal Water and San José State 
University are collaborating on a new model 
for university–industry partnerships.

members. Following is a description 
of the significant objectives and outcomes for each major meeting. 
Brainstorming session (Aug. 6, 2014). 
The principal objective of this meeting 
was to formulate a mature list of 
research focus areas, topics, and potential projects. The key participants were 
a diversified group of Cal Water engineering, water quality, and operations 
managers and supervisors and two 
representatives from SJSU. The principal outcome of this meeting was a 
comprehensive list of about 60 candidate research topics, areas, and individual projects (a broad agenda or 
umbrella) captured in the form of 
meeting minutes. These were then 
reviewed and organized in more detail 
from the perspective of conceptual, 
theoretical, and business-process similarities and linkages as well as from the 
perspective of overall categorical 
impact for both Cal Water, and the 
broader water utility sector. Both mindmapping and spreadsheet tools were 
used to complete this consolidation 
and organizational step. This process 
resulted in candidate research projects 
and topics being categorized into the 
six focus areas in Figure 1. The supporting details behind this categorical 
formulation are provided in Table 1.
The definitions of the six selected 
focus areas shown in Figure 1 are 
outlined as follows:
• Asset management—maintain a 
desired level of service at the 
lowest life-cycle cost.

reviewed and narrowed by a small 
group of high-level engineering, operations, water quality, and financial 
executives (rather than conducting a 
time-intensive survey) to facilitate 
more effective administration and indepth discussion of the issues. 
Selection of research focus areas 
(Oct. 30, 2014). The goal of this meeting 
was to choose the final group of 
about seven research focus areas 
that Cal Water and SJSU would pursue in terms of action and implementation. The previously noted 
research umbrella (a list with draft 
topic and project descriptions) was 
distributed to the key participants, 
which included five Cal Water 
engineering and water quality managers and supervisors. 
Team members were asked to 
review the list before the meeting 
under the auspices of their professional knowledge and experience, provide commentary aimed at creating 
additional focus and clarity for the 
purpose of comparative assessment,

and then come to the meeting prepared to argue for (and defend) their 
top five projects. They were also 
asked to use their specific knowledge of Cal Water subjects and 
issues as well as their knowledge of 
more broadly placed industry concerns as the working framework and 
perspective for their final judgment. 
During the meeting, final ratings and 
assessment guidelines were provided 
and discussed. The outcome of this 
meeting was a reduced list of 
research topic and categorical areas 
selected by the work group (Table 2 
compared with Table 1).
The authors then suggested a list 
of specific research projects that fall 
within the selected topic areas. This 
step initially resulted in 25 individual 
projects at the brainstorming level. 
However, given the project timeline 
and other feasibility considerations, 
the number of specific projects under 
consideration was eventually consolidated to 13 for final discussion, 
ranking, and selection. In this case, 
the final list was framed around 
more specifically defined projects as 
opposed to the original broad focus, 
topic, and categorical areas.
Selection of final research projects 
(Mar. 13, 2015). The goal of this meeting was to choose up to seven 
detailed research projects (of the 13 
proposed) that Cal Water and SJSU 
would pursue in terms of action and 
implementation. Before the meeting, 
a recommended project list was distributed that included developmental information that covered the 
projects’ backgrounds as well as the 
overall domains. These documents 
were used for informational and 
feedback purposes as well as for 
providing a clear vision of how the 
projects could be conceptually 
framed. Key participants attending 
the meeting included six Cal Water 
engineering and water quality managers and supervisors. 
As before, team members were 
asked to review the list before the 
meeting under the auspices of their 
professional knowledge and ex -
perience and come to the meeting 
prepared to argue for (and defend) 
their top five projects. During the 
meeting, final ratings and assessment guidelines were provided and 
discussed. Table 3 lists the seven 
projects selected by the group, along 
with their expected timelines and 
envisioned deliverables. 
In Figure 2, the decision process 
timeline for project selection is 
shown. The selection of the final list 
of projects was recognized as a notable milestone, signifying the transition into the next phase of the work, 
including data collection and finetuning of the projects. 
Ongoing process and outlook. The 
project implementation was then prioritized in terms of importance, 
urgency, and data availability. The 
projected timeline of the actual implementation over the next 4.5 years is 
shown in Figure 3. The working time 
span (green), the deadline for each 
project (red), and the proprosed 
journal publication efforts (blue) are 
indicated for each project. It is 
expected that more than 15 journal 
articles will be published over the 
project period. 
During the second quarter of 
2015, project 1 was being initiated 
by performing a series of thorough 
literature surveys, defining the data 
requirements, and selecting the most 
promising solution approaches. 
CONCLUSIONS
In this article, a new model for 
industry–university partnerships as 
well as a decision-making process 
for research projects is described. 
This unique research collaboration 
will allow industry professionals 
and university representatives to 
work together on actual business 
issues within the water utility sector. 
The seven selected critical projects 
that are aligned with corporate 
goals and key business and industry 
concerns will help address gaps in 
the knowledge base that exists
