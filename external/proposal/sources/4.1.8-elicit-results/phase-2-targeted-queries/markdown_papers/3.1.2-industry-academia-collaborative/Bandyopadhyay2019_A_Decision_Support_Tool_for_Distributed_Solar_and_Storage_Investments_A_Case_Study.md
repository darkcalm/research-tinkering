This study builds a decision support tool to evaluate when it is a
good economic decision (least cost with minimum discomfort) for the
residential customer to invest in distributed energy resources
(DERs) based on different electricity rate structures, DER ownership
frameworks, and DER rebates offered by electric utilities. Here, the
tool is demonstrated using empirical electricity consumption data
from Pecan Street Inc. (a non-profit entity based on Austin, Texas),
residential rates from Austin Energy (the municipal electric utility in
Austin, Texas), DER ownership costs from various nationwide pilot
programs, and incentives offered by electric utilities in the United
States. Results show that for constant electricity rates, the overall
expenditure is least when the customer owns solar panels without
storage, while for time-varying pricing structures, the least expensive
scenario is one where the customer does not own any DERs. As the
capital costs for DERs decline, utilities incentivize customer
ownership of DERs, and more residential customers face the
decision of whether to invest in DERs, this study aims to be a key
tool in aiding that decision-making process.
