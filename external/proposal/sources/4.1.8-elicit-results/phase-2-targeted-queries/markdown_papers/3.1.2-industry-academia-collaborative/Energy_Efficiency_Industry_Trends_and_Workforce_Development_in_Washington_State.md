Executive Summary 
This report is the first part of a planned two-phase study indentifying trends and 
workforce issues in the energy efficiency industry. The primary purpose of this research 
is to provide up-to-date information on the status of energy efficiency activities in 
Washington, and to identify workforce development needs and opportunities that can 
assist employers and public and private-sector education and training providers support 
continued growth in the industry. The current report, Phase 1, integrates existing 
research on the energy efficiency industry, analyzes recent growth trends and forecasts, 
and discusses the major drivers of change, employment impacts and identifies existing 
energy efficiency-related training opportunities. 
 
The energy efficiency industry is seeing unprecedented growth globally, nationally and 
regionally. Increasingly volatile energy prices, energy supply concerns, technology 
advances, climate change and a desire for greater energy independence are all driving up 
demand for additional energy efficiency efforts, and these pressures are likely to result in 
sustained long-term growth in the energy efficiency industry and related employment. 
 
Many policies and incentives are in place nationally, regionally and at the state level 
which provide support to the energy efficiency industry. The federal government has 
recently targeted the energy efficiency industry for $30 billion in economic stimulus 
investments. Regionally, the Bonneville Power Administration and the Northwest Power 
and Conservation Council guide a significant amount of the electric utility conservation 
program activity in the Northwest. Washington State is a recognized leader in energy 
efficiency, and federal investments combined with state policies will usher in an 
expansion of energy conservation beyond what currently exists. Utility programs are 
affected by all of these activities as well the unique situation faced by each utility. 
 
Growth in energy efficiency implementation is constrained by the lack of data and 
measurements that could be used to support coordinated efficiency efforts at all levels of 
the economy, from international to local. More comprehensive data would assist in 
raising public awareness about the benefits and opportunities for energy and cost savings, 
and help inform business and consumer decisions. 
 
Employment projections suggest that the workforce will need to expand rapidly to meet 
the increasing demand for energy efficiency products and services. Energy services 
companies, government and utility efficiency programs, and weatherization programs 
could grow substantially in the coming years. In the short term, federal stimulus 
investments will boost demand for skilled workers and new trainees, while investments in 
research and development and efficiency-related technologies will create new 
employment and business opportunities. 
 
One recent national study estimates the number of employees in the industry could 
double, and perhaps quadruple, by 2020. Some employers are already experiencing 
difficulties finding employees with specific training necessary for energy efficiency 
occupations. Retirement projections and a shrinking population of working-age adults

suggest that meeting the growing demand for a skilled energy efficiency workforce will 
be a significant challenge. 
 
Additional research and action is needed to identify the specific skills, education 
requirements and employment demand for the energy efficiency sector. Expansion of 
regional and state education and training capacity to support new growth in energy 
efficiency is warranted, but efforts to enhance or expand the existing education and 
training infrastructure should be based on systematic data and input from the industry. 
Regional coordination between industry and key stakeholders should be used to inform 
the development of a broader strategy for supporting continued growth in the state’s 
energy efficiency industry. Some recommended actions steps and research for 
Washington include the following: 
• Support additional research that focuses specifically on the workforce 
development needs and labor markets of energy efficiency employers and 
employees in the region and the state. 
• Expand the number and scope of industry partnerships to identify employment 
needs, and the foundational skills and knowledge requirements, for key sectors of 
the energy efficiency industry. 
• Create new energy efficiency courses, certificates and degree programs and 
enhance existing programs to boost education and training system capacity. 
• Conduct and apply research on best practices, model curriculum, industry-defined 
skill standards, and certifications for current and future training programs. 
• Raise the visibility of energy efficiency careers and educational opportunities 
among youth and job seekers to expand the future workforce pipeline. 
• Support development of an industry and labor market information system that 
provides high quality data for energy efficiency-related labor markets, education 
and training opportunities and employment.

Introduction 
This report is the first part of a planned two-phase study indentifying trends and 
workforce issues in the energy efficiency industry. The primary purpose of this research 
is to provide up-to-date information on the status of energy efficiency activities in 
Washington, and to identify workforce development needs and opportunities that can 
assist employers and public and private-sector education and training providers support 
continued growth in the industry. 
 
The current report, Phase 1, integrates existing research, analyzes recent growth trends 
and forecasts, and discusses the major drivers of change in the energy efficiency industry. 
Additionally, this report begins to identify the potential impact on employment and 
identifies existing energy efficiency-related training opportunities. 
 
The current report begins with a brief overview of global change underway in the energy 
sector as it relates to efficiency, and the political environment driving this change. 
Recent and forecasted trends in the energy efficiency sectors in the U.S., the Pacific 
Northwest region, Washington State, and in the Pacific Mountain region are also 
discussed. Globally and nationally, the focus is on efficiency across the broad energy 
economy, but in the Northwest region and Washington State, the primary focus is on 
electricity-specific efficiency. The report concludes with an initial look at workforce 
trends relating to the energy efficiency industry, and offers recommendations for future 
research. 
 
Phase 2, which is proposed, will look more deeply into workforce issues by identifying 
the key workforce factors that employers, labor and other industry experts believe need to 
be addressed to ensure that the current and future workforce is prepared to meet this 
growth.

Defining Efficiency and the Energy Efficiency Industry 
It is not an exaggeration to say that energy is a ubiquitous resource; it is in use at any 
given moment of the day, and it is a cornerstone of our economy and any modern society. 
Energy is the resource that powers transportation, cooking, heating and cooling buildings, 
manufacturing, lighting, water-use and entertainment, and many other sectors of society. 
Rather than increasing energy supply by constructing new power plants or expanding oil 
production, energy efficiency initiatives focus on reducing energy demand through a 
broader use of energy efficient technologies and by changing behavior patterns. In 
general terms, energy efficiency can be described as the decrease in energy (input) 
needed to do the same amount of work (output), or maximizing the output per unit of 
energy input. 
 
However, because energy efficiency refers to a resource that spans so many possible 
economic sectors and applications, there exists no commonly-accepted definition of 
energy efficiency, much less its scope. Differences in stated policy objectives and goals 
influence the methods and metrics used for measuring efficiency, which in turn can result 
in different operational definitions of efficiency. Paradoxically, efficiency is also 
difficult to measure due to its invisibility, since tracking efficiency means measuring the 
energy that is not used. This invisibility is inhibiting development of educated policy, 
planning and investment in energy efficiency—a low-risk, high-value resource. 
 
Measuring Efficiency – A Difficult Task 
In addition to the lack of a common definition, terms that incorporate some aspects of 
energy efficiency are often used interchangeably, or as proxies for energy efficiency. For 
example, energy conservation is the term generally used to describe a short-term energy 
reduction, while energy efficiency implies a long-term reduction in energy consumption 
with no corresponding decrease in the amount of work. Yet these two terms are often 
assumed to mean the same thing. As another example, energy efficiency and demandside management (DSM) programs are sometimes referred to interchangeably, but there 
are important differences between the two terms. DSM programs are usually sponsored 
and financed by utilities and energy distribution companies in order to reduce peak load 
requirements (times during which energy demand is at its highest and costliest for the 
utilities). In contrast, efficiency programs typically are directed at energy consumption in 
all residences and businesses, at all hours of the day and seasons of the year. Utilities and 
energy companies may or may not see any significant benefits from efficiency programs. 
In fact, some utilities view efficiency programs as spending money on activities which 
reduce their revenue stream. 
 
Finally, energy intensity indicators, which are often used to measure the change in energy 
efficiency over time, frequently oversimplify energy efficiency activities and create 
misleading interpretations. Unknown influences such as changes in market conditions or 
consumer behavior can be the real, underlying causes of change in energy intensity 
measures that are intended to reflect efficiency improvements. For example, a measure 
of the energy use per dollar of manufactured goods in the U.S. that shows a decline might 
lead to the conclusion that the manufacturing sector is becoming more efficient. But this

---

energy-intensity indicator doesn’t reveal if the decline is actually due to efficiency 
improvements or because many of the most energy-intensive industries have relocated 
outside the U.S. Energy efficiency indicators generally need additional context to be 
correctly interpreted, yet frequently surface-level data is all that is available. 
 
It is important to note that the success of any energy efficiency initiative or program, 
however it is defined, is heavily dependent on consumer behavior. For instance, there 
exists a whole host of technologies and products that can be used to achieve energy 
efficiency goals: compact fluorescent light bulbs, high-efficiency furnaces, or a 
programmable thermostat, for example. But the ability of these technologies to generate 
energy efficiency gains rests entirely on how willing consumers are to acquire and use 
these technologies. Thus, a utility may boost funding for energy efficiency programs to 
provide an incentive to consumers to purchase products or tools that maximize efficiency, 
but the utility may not see any savings until a customer decides to take action. 
 
The Energy Efficiency Industry 
Just as there is no common definition of energy efficiency, there are also varying 
definitions of the energy efficiency industry as a whole. As noted earlier, energy 
efficiency can include a broad set of activities, policies and activities, and studies of 
energy efficiency as an industry sector often describe the industry in different ways. 
Often, the descriptions used by industry leaders provide very broad definitions of the 
industry rather than specifying all component parts. One useful example comes from the 
Northwest Energy Efficiency Council (NEEC), which describes the energy efficiency 
industry as follows: 
 
The ‘Energy Efficiency Industry’ is made up of companies and organizations that 
employ people and apply resources in an effort to reduce energy consumption. 
Changes on the systemic or policy level are led by people working in the 
government, at non-profits or at utilities; these people help to coordinate and 
facilitate the work of energy efficiency businesses.1 
 
NEEC defines an energy efficiency business as “a company that makes a profit through 
employing people and applying resources towards reducing the amount of energy needed 
to maintain a level of use or to provide a service (like heating or lighting)” (p. 4). 
 
In other cases, the energy efficiency industry described by researchers depends on the 
goals and focus of the research, including the research methods and metrics used. For 
example, a major national study sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy conducted 
by researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) describes the 
energy efficiency industry as: 
 
A multi-disciplinary industry, including engineers, economists, marketers, 
designers, and tradespeople. In many ways, it does not constitute an independent 
industry, since the activities of the industry, rather than being new efforts, often 
consist of a shift from standard practice to a more energy-efficient approach to 
design, building construction, and building operations.2

Because LBNL’s study examines the effects of forecasted growth in the energy efficiency 
industry on employment and occupational structure, the study also recognizes the 
emergence of many new skill-sets and new professional job categories, including 
program administrators and program management contractors who design and manage 
government-supported energy efficiency programs (described later in this report). Hence 
the definition, scope of the research and level of detail related to the energy efficiency 
industry is intentionally limited and refined so that the analyses and interpretation of 
efficiency-related business activities is directly tied to the goals of the research. 
 
The LBNL and NEEC definitions highlight one of the inherent difficulties of describing 
the energy efficiency industry, which may include myriad levels and participants. There 
are companies who make energy efficiency their primary business, and may therefore 
constitute the first-tier of the energy efficiency industry. This is typically the focus of 
many analyses of the energy efficiency industry and policy initiatives. First-tier 
companies have the potential for fundamentally and directly altering energy markets 
through the introduction of innovative technologies, products or services that boost the 
potential for energy efficiency activities. 
 
There are additional, second-tier businesses that are also major contributors to achieving 
energy efficiency goals, even though energy efficiency may not be part of their core 
business: engineering firms, building industry contractors, or appliance manufacturers 
who build or install some of the new technologies that then become available to 
consumers, including other businesses that have a sizable yet indirect effect on the pursuit 
of energy efficiency goals. 
 
Finally, there are many more companies – perhaps a majority of all businesses—that 
could be classified as third-tier companies, those that implement some level of energy 
efficiency activities. These businesses are typically the target markets for the producers 
of energy efficiency technologies and tools. As noted above, since the success of energy 
efficiency activities depends on both the technology tools and supportive consumer 
behaviors, the three general tiers of the energy efficiency industry are truly 
interdependent and essential to achieving broader economic and environmental goals. 
 
In summary, the diverse nature of energy efficiency activities and the interdependency 
among industry players makes it extremely difficult to clearly distinguish between these 
businesses. Many energy efficiency studies use definitions, methods and measurements 
that are constructed to support analyses of specific components of the energy efficiency 
industry. The choice of components and the focus of the inquiry can vary greatly 
depending on the goals and purposes of the research. Taken together, these factors make 
direct comparisons of research results difficult and pose challenges to defining and 
understanding energy efficiency as a dynamic industry sector.

Global and National Energy Efficiency Trends 
The section reviews the structure of the global and national energy efficiency industry, 
including trends, achievements and potential. A review of recent studies conducted on 
efficiency within the U.S., drivers of change, and recent national policy developments are 
also presented. 
Global Energy Efficiency Organizational Infrastructure 
Much of the world’s fossil-based energy resources (coal, petroleum, and natural gas) are 
transported across vast distances in a highly organized market system. The management 
of these resources is consolidated into relatively few organizations, such as large 
multinational corporations and governments. There are many organizations with long 
histories, established rules and deep economic and political connections whose primary 
objectives are the delivery of fossil-fuel resources. 
 
In contrast, energy efficiency is overwhelmingly local and diffused across every sector of 
the world economy, and it has a very small presence in global governance, regulation, 
business or cooperation. There are a large number of international energy initiatives; 
however only a few actively promote energy efficiency.3 Additionally, the main 
contribution of those initiatives is not to actually implement efficiency technologies, but 
rather to create standards and regulations, share information, facilitate research, and/or 
allow funding of efficiency projects for economies in transition. 
 
There are signs that this dynamic is changing. Improved energy efficiency is increasingly 
recognized as an economical and readily available means of improving energy security 
and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Indeed, a number of influential studies suggest 
that energy efficiency options should account for an estimated 40-45 percent of the 
actions required to curb greenhouse gas emissions enough to stabilize the climate by 
2050.4 This has led to a growing recognition of the importance of energy efficiency 
initiatives for achieving global and national climate, energy security and economic goals. 
 
Global Energy Efficiency Data and Trends 
Surprisingly little data is readily available about global energy efficiency. The 
International Energy Agency (IEA), in cooperation with the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development, has only recently begun collecting and analyzing 
efficiency data, most of which comes only from their member countries. One analysis 
conducted by IEA shows that in 2006, the global energy cost savings from energy 
efficiency was $1.1 trillion.5 But, the rate of energy efficiency improvements since 1990 
has been much slower than in the previous two decades. The IEA report also reveals that 
total energy consumption in developing and transition countries is growing less quickly 
than the gross domestic product of these countries, due partly to energy efficiency 
improvements. Yet, the energy intensities of developing and transition countries remain 
higher on average than for more developed countries. 
 
Globally, the potential for further energy savings through energy efficiency policies and 
activities is substantial and opportunities exist across all industry sectors. The IEA

analysis of the industrial sector suggests that the application of proven technologies and 
best practices on a global scale could save between 18 and 26 percent of industrial sector 
energy use. The largest savings potential is in the iron and steel, cement, and chemical 
and petrochemical sectors. 
 
While some older power plants convert only 25% of the fuel they consume into 
electricity, the most modern natural gas generators are more than 50% efficient. In the 
electricity generation sector, if all countries produced electricity at current “best practice” 
levels of efficiency, then fossil fuel consumption could be reduced by 23 to 32 percent. 
Electricity production accounts for 32% of total global fossil fuel use and around 41% of 
total energy related CO2 emissions. Improving the efficiency with which electricity is 
produced is therefore one of the most important ways of reducing the world’s dependence 
on fossil fuels, helping both to combat climate change and improve energy security. 
Additional fuel efficiency gains can be made by linking electricity generation to heating 
and cooling demands through high efficiency combined heat and power (CHP) systems 
(e.g., for industrial use and for district heating). Because about half of electricity comes 
from coal, and because most of the oldest fossil fuel power plants are coal-fired, the 
largest energy-saving potential in electricity production comes from coal-fired plants, and 
just over half of the savings comes from developing and transition countries.6 
 
In short, the available data on global energy are limited, but what does exist suggests that 
efforts to implement related policies and actions have generated significant improvements 
in energy savings, and there are many more opportunities to achieve additional savings 
through energy efficiency initiatives. But, the rate of energy efficiency improvements 
has slowed compared to the past, and this rate will need to be increased substantially in 
order to help ensure that we achieve a more secure and sustainable global energy future. 
 
Global Household Energy Use 
The amount of energy used in households is affected by many social and structural 
factors including income, age of homeowners, size of home, population, age of home and 
equipment. Other major impacts on energy use come from weather, appliance energy 
standards, and the availability of energy-saving programs. In the U.S., the most 
important factor affecting specifically electricity demand is household income, followed 
by weather.7 Rising incomes cause a shift from multi-family to single family homes, 
from smaller homes to larger homes and an increase in people living alone. Also, as 
incomes rise, households purchase more energy-consuming goods such as appliances, air 
conditioners and other consumer electronics. That some of those goods have become 
more efficient has not offset the overall growth in ownership of these goods. (A more 
detailed discussion on economic drivers of residential electricity demand in the 
Northwest can be found in Appendix A). 
 
Global energy use in the residential sector increased 19 percent between 1990 and 2005.8 
For developed countries, electricity and natural gas are primary energy commodities, 
accounting for 72 percent of household energy use. In transitional economies, renewable 
energy sources (most of which are traditional sources of biomass) are the primary energy 
commodity, but that share is decreasing, while electricity use has grown dramatically, 
increasing 140 percent between 1990 and 2005.

The IEA recently conducted a detailed analysis of household energy efficiency for 19 
IEA-member countries.9 This study found that space heating energy use is growing 
slowly and remains the most important energy user, responsible for 53% of household 
final energy consumption. In contrast, household appliance energy use (mostly 
electricity) is growing very rapidly and has overtaken water heating as the second most 
important household energy demand. For space heating, efficiency gains are being offset 
by increased demand of larger homes and lower occupancy rates, mostly in developed 
countries. 
 
Much of the energy and CO2 emissions increases are being driven by small appliances 
and air conditioning rather than large appliances, which now represent only 51 percent of 
total appliance energy consumption, and this share is falling. Figure 1 shows the average 
unit of energy consumption for large and small appliances in a group of 15 European 
countries. With the exception of televisions, all these appliances have shown a 
significant decrease in average unit energy consumption since 1990. In the case of 
refrigerators and freezers, the average unit energy consumption has declined, even though 
the appliances themselves have become larger. For televisions, energy efficiency gains 
have been outstripped by the consumer trend towards larger screens, which use more 
energy. However, total household appliance energy consumption in these 15 countries 
fell only in the case of refrigerators and washing machines. For other, mostly small 
appliances, improved energy consumption per unit has been more than offset by higher 
levels of ownership and use.

Energy Efficiency in the U.S. 
Currently there is very little comprehensive data available measuring the energy 
efficiency of the U.S economy. Although there is a great deal of data available through 
multiple government and private resources on the cost of energy supply resources, there 
is less definitive data available on the cost or potential of energy efficiency resources. 
 
A 2009 study by Mc Kinsey and Co. called Unlocking Energy Efficiency in the U.S. 
Economy shows that the U.S. economy has the potential to reduce annual nontransportation energy consumption by roughly 23 percent by 2020, eliminating more than 
$1.2 trillion in waste – well beyond the $520 billion upfront investment (not including 
program costs) that would be required. The reduction in energy use would also result in 
the abatement of 1.1 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions annually – the equivalent of 
taking the entire U.S. fleet of passenger vehicles and light trucks off the roads. The 
residential sector accounts for about 35 percent of the savings, the industrial sector about 
40 percent and the commercial sector 25 percent.10 
 
Figure 2 shows the variety of sources for energy savings found in the Mc Kinsey study. 
In the graph, bar height represents cost (low bars are less expensive to implement) and 
bar width represents energy savings potential. The report only looked at cases where the 
economic payback of the improvements would ultimately outweigh the initial investment. 
 
The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) recently published a 
different study revealing that in 2004, $300 billion was invested in energy efficiency 
technologies and infrastructure in the U.S.11 This investment is about three times the size 
of those made in conventional energy supply infrastructure, such as construction of new 
power plants. And while $300 billion is a sizeable amount, it represents less than onethird of the nation’s annual energy expenditures. 
 
The ACEEE study noted that energy savings resulting from these investments in 
efficiency technology are roughly equivalent to the output of 40 mid-sized coal plants. 
ACEEE estimated that by the end of 2008 the savings due to investments in energy 
efficiency will total around $77.4 billion. As depicted in Table 1, about 60% ($178 
billion) of the energy efficiency investments were made in the buildings sector. Of that 
total, nearly half (49%) were in energy efficient appliances and electronics, 29% were in 
commercial building structures, and 22% were investments in residential building 
structures. Table 1 also shows that at $75 billion, investments in the industrial sector 
were about 25% of total efficiency investments. Transportation investments were about 
$33 billion (11%).

The Mc Kinsey report also estimated energy efficiency investments. In their findings, of 
the 2008 nationwide investments in energy efficiency activities, 14% were from utilitysponsored programs, 19% from energy services companies (ESCOs), 22% for 
incremental (above-code) investments in insulation and energy devices and the remaining 
44% was spent on meeting existing building codes and standards. 
 
Driving Energy Efficiency Industry Growth 
The ACEEE study noted that “in an environment of accelerated market transformation 
and rapid growth in efficiency investments, total investments in more energy efficiency 
technologies could increase the annual energy efficiency market by nearly $400 billion 
by 2030, resulting in an annual efficiency market of more than $700 billion in 2030.”12 
The study proposes that the U.S. can cost-effectively reduce energy consumption by 2530% or more over the next 20-25 years. 
 
The focus on developing new markets and generating savings for consumers has levied 
considerable attention on the need to grow the energy efficiency sector even more. Yet 
there are other significant pressures as well: energy prices have become increasingly 
volatile, and there have been very few additions to energy supplies such as new power 
plants or new fossil fuel supplies. Constraints in energy supply markets are far-reaching 
and can provide motivation to pursue efficiency initiatives. Scientific evidence and 
political pressure to address climate change has become stronger, and calls for action to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions are becoming increasingly urgent. Additionally, 
consumers are raising concerns about energy industry environmental impacts and there 
are growing international pressures to manage these impacts in countries such as India 
and China, which are expanding generation capacity rapidly. Finally, energy and energy 
efficiency technologies are rapidly changing, providing many new opportunities to

implement technology solutions that greatly enhance efforts to improve energy 
efficiency. 
 
Electricity and natural gas utilities have a long history as the coordinators and promoters 
of energy efficiency for their customers, and utility-based investment incentives have 
been the most widely used efficiency policy tool in the U.S. States and utilities spend 
about $2.6 billion annually on efficiency programs.13 Sixteen states, including 
Washington, have implemented energy efficiency resource standards, which set 
efficiency goals similar to renewable energy targets (Washington’s efficiency target is 
part of voter Initiative 937, discussed later).14 There is considerable pressure to create a 
federal efficiency standard as well. A national standard for energy efficiency, combined 
with existing state energy efficiency standards, could drive future investments in 
efficiency to new heights. 
 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act 
The national recession has also helped to boost the visibility of energy efficiency, as part 
of a strategy to support economic recovery. Even prior to the recession, the idea of 
growing a clean energy-based economy was viewed as a key strategy for addressing the 
growing concern about climate change and the structural changes that will be needed to 
reduce the nation’s carbon footprint. At the same time, a clean-energy economy was 
promoted as a way to usher in a new foundation for national economic growth and 
employment that will generate thousands of new, good-paying “green” jobs that could 
also provide new employment opportunities for disadvantaged populations to enhance 
social equity. Many policy papers, studies and reports from industry groups, labor unions 
and advocacy groups emphasize the importance of shifting to a clean energy economy to 
accomplish these goals.15 
 
In February of 2009 President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act (ARRA) which provides nearly $800 billion for economic stimulus 
activities. The Act has a major focus on energy efficiency, renewable energy and 
education and training related to these activities. Energy efficiency actions alone are 
earmarked to receive $30 billion in new investments. The Act intends to double the 
renewable energy capacity of the U.S and undertake the largest weatherization program 
in history by modernizing 75% of federal buildings and more than a million homes. 
Through the U.S. Department of Labor, $500 million is available on a competitive basis 
and a primary focus of these funds is to prepare workers for careers in energy efficiency 
and renewable industries.16 The U.S. Department of Energy is sponsoring up to $40 
million for developing and enhancing workforce training programs for the electric power 
sector and up to $65 million for smart grid workforce training. The U.S. Department of 
Education is expected to announce funding opportunities that support additional 
foundational academic and career and technical education programs that can support 
energy-related workforce development. 
 
For its share of the overall stimulus act expenditures, Washington State will receive $4.1 
billion in dedicated funds, $60 million of which is dedicated specifically to energy 
efficiency weatherization programs (of which $10 million is dedicated to training). The

state and public agencies are eligible for additional competitive funds, including those 
available for energy-related education and training.17 This influx of new money presents 
many challenges and opportunities for an expanded infrastructure and action to support 
energy efficiency initiatives nationally, across the Pacific Northwest, and in Washington 
State.

Regional Legislation and Policy 
This section reviews the roles and activities of the Northwest Power and Conservation 
Council and the Bonneville Power Administration. It also discusses the region’s 
conservation achievements, drivers of growth, remaining efficiency potential and 
efficiency targets for the region and utilities. A sample of state utility conservation 
program activities is also described. 
Northwest Power Act and Bonneville Power Administration 
For the past thirty years, the most significant force guiding energy development and 
energy efficiency activities in the Northwest has been the Northwest Power Act (the 
Power Act), enacted by Congress in 1980.18 The Power Act required Bonneville Power 
Administration (BPA), the wholesale power marketer of the federal hydro system, to 
pursue energy efficiency initiatives (in addition to new power) to meet the region’s 
growing electricity needs. Congress intended that BPA would constantly reduce its 
power demand by increasing the efficiency of its customers’ energy use, which would 
also lower electricity costs for regional consumers. 
 
The Regional Power Plan 
The Northwest Power Act also authorized the states in the region to establish the 
Northwest Power and Conservation Council (NWPCC), which in turn was directed to 
produce the Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Plan which spells out strategies 
for meeting the electrical power needs of the region at the lowest possible cost.19 The 
Regional Power Plan, as this report will refer to it, must give highest priority to costeffective energy efficiencies (also called “conservation”) to meet future demand for 
electricity. Renewable resources were given the next-highest priority. To the extent 
renewables are cost effective, they are ranked ahead of thermal generating resources such 
as natural gas. Among the thermal options, fuel-efficient methods of producing energy, 
such as cogeneration, must be given priority.20 
 
The Regional Power Plan is updated every five years. The Draft Sixth Northwest Power 
Plan is currently available and it is due to be approved in the fall of 2009. This report 
incorporates early-released data from the Draft Sixth Northwest Power Plan to the extent 
that it is available.21 
 
Because the Regional Power Plan adopted by the NWPCC directs BPA to be responsive 
to the power needs of its customers, BPA must seek to invest in and provide new power 
based on these priorities, beginning with providing cost-effective conservation and 
renewable resources. BPA may purchase power from new thermal projects, but only 
after determining that cost-effective conservation and renewables cannot be achieved or 
developed in time. The Regional Power Plan is also the basis for utility investment 
decisions in the region, and individual utilities are tasked with meeting individual goals 
that support achieving this regional goal. BPA credits utilities with a rate discount for 
their individual actions to implement conservation and develop renewables, though the 
actions utilities take must be approved by BPA.

Regional Conservation Achievement 
The Power Act has resulted in the acquisition of over 3,600 average megawatts of energy 
efficiency between 1980 and 2007.22 This is equivalent to the annual power needs of 
three cities the size of Seattle, the output of 6 or 7 coal plants, or all of the power needs of 
Idaho and Western Montana in 2008.23 BPA and the utilities in the region acquired 1,941 
average megawatts of that amount, over half of which was in the service territories of 
publicly owned utilities and under half was in the service territories of the investor owned 
utilities. The remaining efficiency – nearly 1,900 megawatts – was acquired as a result of 
state building codes, energy efficiency standards, and market-transformation efforts led 
by the Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance (NEEA).24 
 
Figure 3 shows the annual energy savings from conservation activities and related 
programs in the region between 1991 and 2007. The savings shown are a result of 
programs sponsored by BPA or NEEA or are a result of state energy codes or federal 
appliance standards. On an aggregate level, energy savings have been variable: 
programs ramped up quickly in the early 1990s, then tapered off, followed by another 
boom in 2001 and subsequent bust. Since 2004, energy savings have increased 
substantially to their highest levels yet seen in the Northwest. 
 
Figure 3. Annual NW Regional Conservation Savings25 

Figure 4 shows cumulative energy savings as a result of the same programs across the 
Northwest between 1978 and 2007. Since 2001, BPA and utility programs have 
accounted for the largest proportion of conservation savings in the region. The 
Washington and Oregon state energy codes are responsible for at least 30 percent of these 
regional energy savings. Additional savings have resulted from federal minimum 
efficiency standards for appliances and efficiency labels for products which exceed the 
standard, such as the ENERGY STAR® label, and from NEEA market transformation 
programs.

Connecting Demand, Power Prices and Cost-effective Conservation 
Expanded energy efficiency initiatives are also central to our ability to address strong 
anticipated demand growth for electric power in the region. The NWPCC’s Draft Sixth 
Northwest Power Plan estimates electricity demand through 2030 as depicted in Figure 
5.27 The figure shows that under any of the three forecast scenarios, without changes in 
efficiency investments, the overall demand for electric power in the region will grow over 
the next 20 years.

Figure 5. NWPCC Electricity Demand Forecast – Draft Sixth Northwest Power Plan 

In the Draft Sixth Northwest Power Plan, the NWPCC estimated that over the next 20 
years nearly 7,000 a MW of energy efficiency is technically achievable across the 
Northwest.28 Of that amount, 5,800 a MW is considered cost-effective and over 4,000 
a MW is achievable for under $40 per megawatt-hour (in the range of current average 
wholesale power prices). The energy savings available for under $40 per megawatt-hour 
is equal to more than 6 coal plants.29 This is about double the quantity of cost-effective 
conservation potential found in The Fifth Northwest Electric Power and Conservation 
Plan (the Fifth Plan). 
 
The primary reason for the major increase in cost-effective conservation is that “avoided 
cost” – or the price the utility avoids paying for new power supply resources by investing 
in conservation – has doubled since the Fifth Plan. Power prices in the current planning 
period have increased much more rapidly than was anticipated during the prior planning 
period. Figure 6 shows the forecast wholesale power price (per megawatt hour) for the 
Draft Sixth Northwest Power Plan relative to the Fifth Plan. The costs of generating 
power have increased substantially. 
 
As wholesale power prices rise, the value of avoiding that cost by implementing 
conservation increases.30 Thus, with both demand and prices rising, the case for boosting 
energy conservation grows even stronger, confirming energy efficiency as the lowest-cost 
strategy for meeting future energy needs.

Forecasted Regional Load Growth by Sector 
Table 2 breaks out the electric load growth by sector as forecasted in the Draft Sixth 
Northwest Power Plan.31 The residential sector, in particular, shows a rapid growth rate; 
it is expected to grow by 2.2 percent per year until 2030. This growth rate is much higher 
than was anticipated in the Fifth Plan, which estimated growth in the residential sector to 
be 1.36 percent.

Power Plan (a MW) 
 
DSI – Direct Service Industry (wholesale industrial customers of BPA) 
 
As shown below in Figure 7, the primary driver of this change is projected demand for 
residential information, communication and entertainment (ICE) appliances. The Draft 
Sixth Northwest Power Plan also predicts significant growth in residential air conditioner 
use. Lighting, refrigeration and water heating represent declining shares of residential 
energy use, which is a direct result of successful efficiency standards and programs. 
 
The forecast rapid growth in electricity consumption, combined with increasing 
wholesale power prices and increasing costs for new generating resources, is creating a 
situation very favorable to new conservation initiatives.

Regional and Utility Energy Efficiency Targets 
The Draft Sixth Northwest Power Plan reveals significantly higher energy efficiency 
targets set for the Northwest. The Regional Plan calls for acquiring 1200 a MW of 
conservation savings by 2014, which represents 58 percent of the new regional demand 
for electricity over the next five years. The Regional Plan also calls for acquiring about 
5800 a MW of conservation savings by 2029, which represents 85 percent of the new 
demand for power in the region.32 
 
In coordination with the Draft Sixth Northwest Power Plan, BPA will begin in 2011 
pursuing all regionally cost-effective electricity savings within the entire service 
territories of its public utility customers, not just the share of their load supplied by BPA. 
This change, combined with BPA’s new rate structure designed to promote efficiency, 
should contribute significantly to energy savings across the region. 
 
BPA, the NWPCC and the region’s utilities have been significant players in 
implementing conservation measures in the Northwest. Some of the Northwest’s largest 
utilities have exceeded their 2007 NWPCC targets by as much as 25%.33 But many 
others have relied exclusively on BPA’s programs, and fallen short of these targets. 
Many of these utilities have very inexpensive power rates and therefore there is little 
economic incentive to spend money on implementing conservation measures. In spite of

the variable levels of activity, more energy efficiency was acquired in the region during 
2007 than in any previous year (see Figure 3, presented earlier).34 
 
Some utilities in Washington State have been strong national leaders for promoting 
energy efficiency. However, it is important to note that while utility programs are an 
important component of the energy efficiency industry, the federal government and states 
also are very active in the industry through their large investments in weatherization 
programs, implementation of building codes, appliance standards and other governmentinitiated activities. Indeed, the majority of the energy efficiency programs offered by 
public utilities are reviewed, approved and jointly paid for by BPA. 
 
Utility Conservation Activities 
Utilities have shown varying levels of activity in their conservation programs. Generally 
speaking, those utilities which are responsible for meeting some or all their own load 
growth (rather than relying on BPA) and are closer to the limits of their existing 
generation resources offer more ambitious conservation programs. Some utilities that 
own their own generation and have large surpluses have found that conservation frees up 
additional power to sell elsewhere at a higher price. 
 
BPA provides utility incentives for nearly all of the consumer efficiency programs 
offered by utilities, including rebates for ENERGY STAR appliances, heat pumps, 
insulation and lighting. The utilities reviewed during this research revealed a strong 
preference for efficiency measures focused on lighting, specifically installing compact 
fluorescent lighting (CFL). CFL measures result in energy savings at relatively little 
expense to the utilities and have resulted in significant energy savings. From the utility’s 
perspective, CFL programs require fewer staff and there is strong regional and national 
marketing support for CFL programs. The utility’s effort and expense is leveraged by 
these coordinated efforts, which influence their choice of program offerings. Very few of 
the programs were targeting energy efficiency activities that would result in substantial 
growth in direct employment, even though these programs probably stimulate new 
demand for energy efficiency products. 
 
Following CFL measures, utilities tend to offer rebates for energy efficient appliances 
and heating and ventilating equipment. Some utilities offer programs targeted at home 
weatherization, or at commercial building design and operations, but these activities 
represent significantly smaller portions of the investments made by the utilities included 
in this review. Many utilities offer low-interest loans or loan guarantees for commercial 
and industrial sector energy efficiency investments. 
 
The information listed below summarizes conservation activities among a sample of 
Washington utilities. This is not a comprehensive list of all programs offered by these 
utilities. If data was available, energy savings as a result of efficiency measures are 
shown below. Utilities offering low-interest loans usually require that energy audits be 
performed prior to work being done. For more details, see individual utility websites.

Public Utilities 
Clark County Public Utility District 
Clark PUD’s conservation program provides loans and grants for weatherization, heat 
pump and market transformation activities. During 2008, $1.4 million dollars in loans 
were provided through the program. Energy savings were not available.35 
 
Chelan County Public Utility District 
Chelan County PUD offers residential customers low-interest loans for efficiency 
upgrades on their homes. Commercial and industrial customers are provided assistance 
in selecting energy efficient heating and cooling systems. Since 2000 the commercial and 
industrial program energy savings is 4.2 a MW. The program was curtailed during 2009 
but is expected to resume in 2010.36 
 
Grant County Public Utility District 
Grant County PUD offers residential customers low-interest loans for efficiency upgrades 
on their homes. The utility also offers rebates for energy efficient lighting, appliances 
and ENERGY STAR manufactured homes. Commercial, farm and industrial customers 
may qualify for lighting rebates, irrigation and cold storage assistance. No energy savings 
data was available.37 
 
Grays Harbor Public Utility District 
Grays Harbor PUD offers low-interest loans to residential and non-residential customers 
for weatherization and efficiency upgrades. The utility offers rebates for heat pumps and 
appliances. Utilization rates and expected energy savings of specific measures were not 
available.38 
 
Lewis County Public Utility District 
Lewis County PUD does not have an active conservation program. It is passing through 
rebates for energy efficient appliances and water heaters through BPA’s conservation rate 
credit program.39 
 
Mason County Public Utility District #1 
Mason PUD #1 offers rebates on appliances, heat pumps, lighting, new ENERGY STAR 
homes, manufactured homes and insulation.40

Seattle City Light 
Seattle City Light developed a five year conservation plan in 2008 which calls for 
doubling the amount of energy savings from the previous plan, exceeding the Northwest 
Power and Conservation Council’s target for Seattle. Seattle’s goal is to save 65.5 a MW 
of electricity, meeting most of the city’s projected load growth through 2012.43 
 
Seattle’s drivers for expanding efficiency targets include climate initiatives, the city’s 
strategic plan (which calls for environmental protection, cost-efficient portfolio of power 
resources and enhanced financial resiliency), and a host of policy, regulatory, social and 
economic development initiatives, including the Seattle Jobs Initiative, which is working 
with local energy efficiency employers and workforce training and education providers 
within the City to create linkages to living-wage jobs.44 
 
Seattle’s plan for achieving their goal expects 52% of the energy savings to come from 
commercial sector programs, 9.8% to come from industrial programs and 38.2% from 
residential and mixed-use programs. The commercial sector programs focus primarily on 
commercial retrofit and lighting measures. The industrial program provides financial and 
technical assistance to new and existing industrial facilities. The residential program 
expects to find most of its savings in retail lighting measures. 
 
Snohomish County Public Utility District 
In 2008, Snohomish County PUD saved more than 60 million k Wh of electricity through 
its conservation programs, enough to power 5,000 homes. Their programs offered 
rebates for efficient appliances, loans and cash incentives for home weatherization 
projects, recycling of energy-wasting refrigerators and freezers, and discounts on 
compact fluorescent light bulbs. Utilization rates and expected energy savings of specific 
measures were not available.45 
 
Tacoma Power 
Tacoma Power has a conservation plan which calls for 54 a MW over the next ten years, 
thus delaying the need for additional supply-side resources for many years. The drivers 
for the plan are Initiative 937 and the recognition that energy efficiency will help 
consumers manage costs. The goal of the conservation programs is to save 5.4 a MW 
every year for the next ten years. 
 
Tacoma Power staff will deliver some of the programs (like weatherization), while 
contractors will deliver some regional programs (like lighting). Some programs target 
the residential sector, including ENERGY STAR lighting and appliance rebates, heatpump rebates, single-family and multi-family weatherization, new manufactured home 
incentives and refrigerator/freezer recycling. The utility offers customized efficiency 
programs for commercial and industrial customers. The utility is also developing several 
new programs.46

Avista’s conservation programs are funded through a rate surcharge which collects about 
$10 million annually from electricity customers. In 2008, over 49 million k Wh of 
electricity savings was attributed to Avista’s conservation programs. The largest savings 
came from measures focused on lighting (40%), heating/ventilating/air conditioning 
(28%) and buildings (10%) though there are several additional small projects.47 
 
Pacifi Corp 
Pacifi Corp collects about $5.6 million annually from Washington ratepayers on a 
conservation surcharge on utility bills. Pacifi Corp’s program activity has resulted in 
about 35 million k Wh in annual electricity savings.48 No details were available for the 
utilization rates or sector-specific savings. 
 
Puget Sound Energy 
Puget Sound Energy (PSE) ratepayers contributed $53 million annually in 2008 for 
measures which have captured about 273 million k Wh (31.2 average megawatts or 
enough to power over 35,000 homes) in electricity savings. PSE increased its 2009 
efficiency goal by over 18% compared to 2008. 
 
PSE’s current measures are focused primarily on lighting, and to a lesser extent retrofits 
to existing buildings, new building design, appliances, heating ventilating and air 
conditioning improvements, and building operator training and services. Over the next 
two decades, PSE expects to save another 440 average-megawatts of electricity and 70 
million therms of natural gas.49

Washington State Policy and Legislation 
Washington State has a long list of policies and legislation which supports the energy 
efficiency industry, and the emphasis on this sector has grown significantly in recent 
years. There are a few policies which particularly stand out as being major drivers for 
change. The first is the Washington State Energy Code which was established in 1977 
and has been enhanced many times since then. It sets the minimum standard for energy 
efficiency for newly constructed buildings.50 The energy code has been a proven success 
at boosting energy conservation and is responsible for at least 30% of the total energy 
savings achieved in the state since it was first enacted.51 Currently, the Washington State 
Energy Code exceeds the very high standards of the International Energy Conservation 
Code. 
 
More recently, Washington voters passed Initiative 937 (I-937), which requires utilities to 
develop all conservation that is cost-effective, reliable and feasible using methodologies 
consistent with those used by the NWPCC.52 Utilities will be completing their plans for 
achieving I-937 targets in January of 2010. At that time, more specific details on the 
activities the utilities will be pursuing will become available. Washington’s I-937 was 
the first state renewable energy standard in the nation to require utilities to also meet 
energy efficiency standards. 
 
A more subtle yet important action was the enactment of House Bill 1010 in 2007. This 
legislation requires utilities to prepare resource plans to demonstrate that they have 
adequate resources to meet their load-serving obligations.53 It makes the utilities’ 
efficiency targets public, puts them into context with other resource acquisition goals, and 
tracks progress towards meeting the targets. 
 
The state has legislated greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, which rely on success 
of energy efficiency measures. The state has also created requirements for publiclyowned buildings to reduce their energy use by 10% and become ENERGY STAR 
certified.54 
 
Table 3 is a summary of state-level energy efficiency policies.55

Washington’s policymakers have shown strong support and leadership for advancing 
efficiency. The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) ranks 
Washington State as sixth in the nation for implementing strong energy efficiency 
policies, which is especially meaningful when considering that Washington has some of 
the cheapest electricity rates in the nation.56 In particular, an increasingly stringent state 
building energy code and the landmark efficiency performance standard have laid a 
foundation for significant growth in the state’s efficiency sector.

The Energy Efficiency Workforce 
This section provides a review of existing research on the energy efficiency workforce, 
and discusses occupations that comprise the workforce and forecasts for growth. The 
impact of federal spending on the national, state and regional efficiency workforce and 
other overarching energy efficiency industry workforce issues are presented. 
 
Existing research on the energy workforce points to the central role that energy efficiency 
plays in employment, and as an economic sector that is important as a job creation 
strategy now and into the future. As shown previously in Table 1, efficiency-related 
investments generated an estimated 1.63 million jobs in the U.S. in 2004. This is roughly 
twice the number of jobs in the energy supply sector. This finding is consistent with a 
growing body of research on energy-related investments and job creation showing that 
energy efficiency employment is likely to provide a large share of new employment in an 
emerging clean energy economy.57 
 
The findings among existing studies on energy efficiency employment and occupations 
vary considerably, depending on the focus of the research, what is defined as efficiency 
employment, and the economic models used to generate forecasts for future employment. 
Some studies consider only direct jobs, which are those associated directly with a specific 
product or service, such as an energy-efficient building design or construction work. 
Other studies include indirect job growth, also known as a “multiplier” that estimates 
second-order job growth associated with increased demand for generic parts or tools 
provided by a supplier, for instance. In general, however, most research confirms that 
energy efficiency employment is already an economic driver.58 
 
According to the ACEEE study (described earlier), the largest number of jobs in the U.S. 
in 2004 was in the buildings sector (900,000), which represents 55 percent of all 
efficiency-related jobs.59 Within that sector, investments in the appliance and electronics 
sector generated the most jobs (more than 370,000), followed by residential construction 
and renovation (316,000 jobs) and commercial construction and renovation (301,000.) In 
addition to the buildings sector, the industrial sector supported 161,000 jobs and utility 
sector power generation efficiency improvements supported employment for 139,000 
workers in 2004. 
Understanding the Energy Efficiency Workforce 
As noted earlier, the diverse nature of energy efficiency activities and the 
interdependency among industry players makes it extremely difficult to clearly 
distinguish between these businesses on many energy efficiency measures. Similarly, 
defining and measuring industry employment, occupational composition, and skill 
requirements of energy efficiency employers is complicated, and there are relatively few 
systematic studies available that focus on energy efficiency workforce issues. The 
shortage of reliable research on the energy efficiency workforce has also meant that our 
understanding of the workforce education and training needs of the energy efficiency 
industry is limited.

A recent study of energy efficiency workforce issues by the Lawrence Berkeley National 
Laboratory (LBNL) provides some useful foundational distinctions for the industry.60 In 
designing their study, LBNL researchers developed models that identify the composition 
of the energy efficiency industry, which is most directly impacted by increased program 
activity. Increases in energy efficiency activities are also a function of greater interaction 
between customers and private-sector businesses, who offer related products and services 
through utilities, but also directly, outside of established efficiency programs. Thus, both 
the growth in utility programs and an increasing number of direct transactions between 
consumers and private-sector businesses will augment energy efficiency activity and 
employment. 
 
The LBNL models provide a useful starting point for identifying some of the common 
key sectors, businesses and occupations that comprise the energy efficiency industry. 
Additionally, they show how energy efficiency program activities can translate into 
changes in specific job categories. 
 
As shown in Figures 8 and 9, LBNL’s models highlight the various levels of occupations 
that exist in different functional areas that support energy efficiency program goals and 
activities. The top of Figures 8 and 9 depict the highest level of job categories employed 
in energy efficiency programs—largely program administrators and implementation 
contractors, where efficiency programs typically begin. Below that level are jobs which 
support program administration and implementation, such as marketers, program 
managers and evaluators. The next level shows the major employment sectors involved 
in the final installment or implementation of the energy efficiency activity, followed by 
the relevant occupations within that sector. 
 
These charts are useful in showing the connection between efficiency programs and the 
specific occupations impacted by efficiency program activity. Many of the occupations 
shown, for example electrical contractors or mechanical engineers, have traditionally 
been employed in activities that are not exclusively efficiency related. However these 
jobs are impacted by changes in the efficiency industry. 
 
The models highlight the existing occupations where new job skills are needed, and 
identify new occupations or specialization areas that are emerging, based on research 
reviews and interviews with employers and energy efficiency experts. The occupations at 
the top tier of both Figures 8 and 9 could be federal, state, local, utility, business or 
industrial sector energy efficiency program administrators; in fact, those occupations 
could be present in nearly any entity which originates an efficiency program

Figure 10. Sample Job Descriptions from Seattle City Light’s Five Year 
Conservation Plan 
 
What does a Utility Energy Efficiency Planner Do? 
Planning is the merger of technical analysis, market research and utility planning. 
The planning group must understand how customers use City Light’s product 
(electricity) and how that use is growing, both by individual customers and in the 
overall system. Once planners understand this, they must identify how to reduce 
consumption through pricing signals (rate design), technology or by altering 
customers’ behavior. 
 
Planners rely on market intelligence; technology assessment; experience with 
previous program successes and failures; utility requirements and costs; and 
regional commitments/standards/laws/regulations available for the optimization of 
program design. 
 
Planners must use the data to identify specific goals, such as —reducing energy 
consumption or peak use, and changing time of use. For example, if the goal is to 
reduce the energy used for residential lighting by convincing customers to convert 
to compact fluorescent lighting, planners might provide incentives to reduce the 
products’ price. That seems straight forward. Yet implementing such a “simple” 
idea requires the coordination of thousands of retailers, all with unique delivery 
channels and in-store processes. 
 
What Does a Utility Program Implementer Do? 
Program implementers base implementation plans on planners’ program design 
requirements. Implementation plans must address several questions: 
 
• Which set of customers is the program designed to serve with available resources? 
• How many customers can be influenced in a specific period of time? 
• Which is the best way to access those customers: individually or through mass 
marketing? 
• How can City Light influence those customers most effectively: by —providing 
incentives to reduce the measure cost, providing point-of-sale rebates, educating 
customers about their options, or other approaches? 
 
Once implementers determine how to influence the targeted customers to 
participate, they must develop successful sales strategies. They also must quantify 
outcomes, including the number of participants and the amount of energy savings, 
through evaluation, measurement and verification.

Forecasts for Growth in Energy Efficiency Occupations 
LBNL researchers also generated forecasts for job growth in energy efficiency based on 
estimates of future investments in energy efficiency (Figure 10). Preliminary results 
suggest there will be large growth in employment resulting from expected increases in 
spending in energy efficiency activities: employment in energy efficiency jobs could 
quadruple from just over 100,000 person-year equivalents in 2008 to over 400,000 by 
2020. The greatest increase in number of jobs would be for insulation-related 
contracting (perhaps as many as 200,000 jobs by 2020). Energy services companies, 
government and utility efficiency programs and weatherization programs all could grow 
substantially. Even the low-spending scenario, which was described by researchers as 
extremely conservative, shows the energy efficiency workforce doubling by 2020. The 
high-spending scenario does not include full regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, 
which would further expand the energy efficiency workforce.

$60 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and stimulus funding for 
job creation and education and training programs to support growth of energy efficiency 
initiatives is available through several federal agencies. In the course of ramping up the 
Weatherization Assistance Program, estimates were created to identify the type of 
occupations and number of expected jobs.61 These estimates, shown in Figures 11 and 
12, show a quadrupling of jobs needed to implement the program; the current number of 
jobs is approximately 13,000 and is expected to grow to 56,000. Crew installers, 
representing the largest proportion of occupations, are forecast to increase from 
approximately 6,000 jobs in 2008 to over 35,000 jobs in 2020. 
 
Nearly all low-income weatherization programs in Washington are contracted to local 
agencies that carry out the work. These agencies receive state and federal funding 
through the Washington State Department of Commerce. Utility funds may also be used 
for energy efficiency measures that are eligible for incentives.

Washington State Energy Efficiency Employment 
Washington State recently completed two reports on workforce and job training needs for 
the green economy that provide some support for the national studies and findings noted 
above: 2008 Washington State Green Economy Jobs (referred to below as Green 
Economy Jobs Study) and Washington State’s Green Economy: A Strategic Framework 
(referred to below as Strategic Framework Study).62 Although these reports did not 
specifically target energy efficiency, employment or job growth, both reports provide 
some insights into quantifying the number of jobs and types of occupations, and they 
begin to identify some specific workforce needs for the energy efficiency sector. The 
Green Economy Jobs Study also established a statistical foundation for measuring job 
growth over time, and recently-passed legislation (HB 2227) calls for additional research 
and a follow-up survey that will examine changes in energy efficiency employment.

### Page 39

The Green Economy Jobs Study research was based on a random sample of all 
Washington state employers who responded to a survey about business activities and 
employees who have direct employment in specific green industries. The study identified 
the green economy as rooted in the development and use of products and services that 
promote environmental protection and energy security. The study included industries and 
businesses engaged in: 
 
• Energy efficiency 
• Renewable energy 
• Preventing and reducing pollution 
• Mitigating or cleaning up pollution 
 
“Green jobs” were generally defined as jobs that promote environmental protection and 
energy security. Over 9,500 private-sector employers responded to the survey, and only 
jobs directly related to products or services provided by companies were included. 
 
Within those conservative parameters, the study found that green employment 
represented 47,194 jobs, or about 1.6 percent of total state employment in 2008. As 
shown in Table 4, energy efficiency jobs make up the most significant portion of green 
jobs, representing over half of all green jobs in the state. Construction-related industries 
and occupations account for 70 percent of employment in the energy efficiency sector, 
followed by professional and technical services such as architecture and engineering.

*The total for all green jobs is greater than the row and column total by 32 jobs because some respondents did not 
report green jobs by any core area. 
 
The study concluded that the large proportion of employment in the energy efficiency 
core area stems in part from the fact that energy efficiency products and services are 
found in a wide variety of industries and occupations; and that these products and 
services have strong markets and historical connections with residential, commercial, and 
industrial construction, which is a significant player in the state’s overall economy. The 
study also noted that the prominence of energy efficiency may also represent the current 
and future market expectations of construction-related employers, who are positioning

themselves to pursue retrofit or renovation-related projects until the market for new 
building construction rebounds. 
 
The Strategic Framework Study reports that our higher education system has not been 
sufficiently responsive to the labor market. This is reflected by the demand for jobs in 
fields which require two and four year degrees relative to the number of students entering 
those fields. At the same time, it has been difficult to attract and retain younger workers 
for many energy efficiency occupations. 
 
Pacific Mountain WDA Energy Efficiency Employment 
The Green Economy Jobs Study also examined employment within the state’s various 
workforce development areas (WDAs). The Pacific Mountain WDA encompasses 
Mason, Grays Harbor, Thurston, Lewis and Pacific Counties. The study found that 
nearly two-thirds of all green economy jobs in the Pacific Mountain WDA were in the 
energy efficiency sector. As shown in Table 5, while energy efficiency employment 
represents less than one percent of all employment in the region, the proportion of energy 
efficiency jobs within the Pacific Mountain WDA was more than 11 percent higher than 
the state average.

These data reveal some interesting trends. Energy efficiency jobs clearly cross a wide 
variety of occupations. Consistent with the overall study findings, the largest proportion 
of jobs is related to the construction industry. In the Pacific Mountain WDA, the number 
of jobs in heating/ventilating and air conditioning is more the double the state average. A 
similar trend exists for carpentry jobs, which account for 9.6 percent of all state energy 
efficiency jobs identified by a Washington State Employment Security Department 
survey. A few of these jobs may appear at first glance to have little relationship to the 
core energy efficiency industry. However, jobs such as loan officers are key to 
implementing low-interest loans for energy efficiency improvements, a popular energy 
efficiency initiative offered by many utilities in the region.

Energy Efficiency Industry Structure and Employment 
In a recent study analyzing the impact of energy efficiency activities on jobs in 
California, efficiency activities were found to have compounding economic benefits. The 
first 1.4 percent of annual efficiency gain produced about 181,000 jobs in California, 
while an additional 1 percent yielded 222,000 additional jobs. The study recognized that 
the marginal efficiency gains would be more expensive, but would also have more 
intensive economic growth benefits.63 
 
The predominance of building industry employment in the energy efficiency sector is 
consistent in the findings of the state’s green jobs survey, the LBNL study, the Mc Kinsey 
report and other studies of the energy-efficiency sector. The findings also suggest 
differences in employment trends across the industry. Government-funded programs 
appear to be focused on longer-term, more labor-intensive structural changes in how 
society uses energy, such as implementing building codes and weatherization programs, 
which may generate many new jobs. 
 
In contrast, utility-sponsored programs appear to have little overlap with the building 
industry; they have found their niche in shorter-term technology-based programs, which 
likely affects employment in the manufacturing sector more than the building sector. 
Although increased demand for energy efficiency products and new smart grid 
technologies may stimulate new job growth, it seems unlikely that the number of jobs in 
manufacturing would increase significantly when production is shifted from traditional 
appliances or technologies to those that are more energy efficient; these new 
manufacturing jobs may also not be local, as employment in this sector relies on many 
national or global suppliers. 
 
Utilities provide important leadership on energy efficiency and related employment. 
They also offer a unique relationship and outreach opportunity with consumers. 
However, they are first and foremost energy service providers; some utilities may have 
limited interest or capacity for providing economic benefits beyond delivering low-cost 
power to their customers. Municipal utilities are in the unique position of being 
embedded within organizations serving community goals, and their structure may lend 
them to be more aware of their role in local economic development and their ability to 
help achieve broader social and economic objectives. For example, while Seattle’s 
primary energy efficiency activity emphasizes efficient lighting programs, the city and 
public utility are also exploring ways to link conservation goals and clean energy 
investments with economic and workforce development efforts, including supporting 
programs (like Seattle Jobs Initiative) that link low-income, low-skill Seattle residents 
with associated training and job opportunities. 
 
Energy Efficiency Workforce Issues 
Concerns about shortages of energy efficiency workers have generated much discussion 
both in terms of current and future labor shortages. A recent survey of eight energy 
efficiency occupations in the San Francisco area determined that these occupations are

---


### Page 43

37 
 
projected to increase substantially in the next three years, creating thousands of jobs in 
that region.64 Employers reported existing difficulty hiring qualified workers in all eight 
occupations. Community colleges in that area are currently exceeding capacity in energy 
efficiency-related classes, and they are rapidly expanding courses, certificates and 
programs to support growth in the industry. 
 
In the Pacific Northwest, the NWPCC, in partnership with regional stakeholders, created 
the Northwest Energy Efficiency Task Force (NEET) to identify infrastructure elements 
needed to advance energy efficiency achievement in the region. One of the working 
groups within the Task Force (Work Group 5) focused on workforce issues and two of 
the ten final NEET recommendations were related to labor training, education and the 
labor market. One recommendation calls for defining energy efficiency jobs, establishing 
skill standards, identifying job classifications and establishing a clearinghouse for jobs. 
The work group also recommended that the Center of Excellence for Energy Technology 
at Centralia College should be expanded to provide a strategic coordinating body to 
partner with other entities and advise on training program expertise and regional needs 
for workforce development. 
 
Washington and the Pacific-Mountain region are likely to face some serious challenges to 
meeting the increased demand for a skilled energy workforce. Washington’s workforce 
in general is growing more slowly than in the past; the aging baby-boom population is 
fast approaching retirement and will be replaced by a smaller cohort of working-age 
individuals through 2030.65 Simultaneously, the population is becoming more diverse, 
increasing the need for basic language and skill development for populations that have 
traditionally been underserved by education.66 
 
Recent research on the electric utility workforce reveals an imminent labor shortage in 
that industry: employers report an existing shortage of qualified applicants in occupations 
across the industry, and with nearly half of the workforce eligible for retirement in the 
next 10 years, those shortages will grow.67 To the extent that energy efficiency 
occupations rely on utility craft and professional workers, this may negatively impact 
labor markets for the efficiency sector as well. 
 
Labor shortages in the energy efficiency industry are likely to be exacerbated by growing 
competition for fewer qualified workers, which is a condition many employers already 
face. The Workforce Training and Education Coordinating Board (WTECB) 2007 
survey of Washington employers found that 60 percent of all Washington employers (and 
33 percent of all Pacific-Mountain WDA employers) had difficulty finding qualified 
applicants for job openings.68 Eighty-two percent of employers reported difficulty 
finding applicants with occupation-specific skills, the most common problem reported by 
employers. The survey showed that the shortage of qualified workers is limiting 
economic growth. 
 
Many of the specific occupations for which employers have difficulty finding qualified 
workers are also key occupations in the energy efficiency industry.69 Sixty-nine percent 
of construction industry employers in the WTECB survey reported having difficulties 
finding qualified applicants. This finding may have changed significantly since the

### Page 44

38 
 
economic downturn, but the effect may be temporary; given the emphasis of the recovery 
efforts on this sector, it seems likely that there will be a shortage of workers with 
specialized training in energy efficiency techniques within the construction industry to 
meet short-term demand, and the industry may be forced to complete for a limited pool of 
skilled energy efficiency workers when the construction industry rebounds. 
 
New jobs and new skills: Early scans of green economy jobs show there is potential for 
creating new jobs and that new skills will be needed in existing jobs.70 Although the core 
work of many existing jobs may not change dramatically, new materials, technologies 
and work processes for energy efficiency-related construction workers and building 
operators may pose new skill requirements, demanding more of new trainees and calling 
for increased upgrade skills training for current workers.71 Current levels of public and 
private training may not be adequate to meet the growing and changing demands on these 
occupations. 
 
Early research on some of the core skills energy efficiency employers have identified 
include a number of technical and general employability skills.72 They include: 
• Basic math, writing, communication and analysis 
• Computers and networks 
• Energy technology and energy systems 
• Concern for the environment and community 
• Technical and plain communication 
• Flexible and able to adapt to change 
 
Training opportunities: Postsecondary education has been responding to changes in 
demand for energy efficiency jobs, and new programs are being developed. Community 
and technical colleges in Washington have been developing new programs for positions 
such as energy auditors and sustainable construction practices, however relatively few 
two-year colleges currently offer energy efficiency as a dedicated program; many 
programs include energy efficiency within broader subjects such as in environmental 
sciences, buildings sciences or engineering technology. 
 
A gap still remains between supply and demand for two and four year degrees in 
occupations such as construction, engineering/architecture, and in occupations supporting 
research which will be crucial to the energy efficiency industry.73 Although the number 
of energy efficiency-specific programs is increasing, this new capacity may still be 
inadequate to keep pace with industry growth and surging demand for a skilled energy 
efficiency workforce. Enhancing coordination between the energy efficiency industry 
and educational institutions would help to expand professional development opportunities 
and ensure that the foundational skills required by industry are integrated into education 
and training programs. 
 
Appendix B contains a list of current energy efficiency education and training 
opportunities in Washington State.

Conclusions and Recommendations 
The energy efficiency industry is experiencing rapid growth, and projections suggest that 
future expansion is imminent. Energy price volatility, supply concerns, technological 
advances, climate change and other environmental concerns are all contributing to these 
growth forecasts. These factors will continue to apply pressure on energy resources for 
the foreseeable future, and are likely to support a steady expansion of efficiency efforts. 
 
The lack of sufficient data and awareness has held back growth in the energy efficiency 
industry in the past, and these gaps have created new challenges. However, the sense of 
urgency for using efficiency as a cost-savings and job creation tool is growing. 
Regardless of how we define, track or measure this industry, growth is underway and 
expected to continue rapidly in the near term as well as into the future. Existing public 
policies affecting energy efficiency initiatives are helping to solidify the role of efficiency 
in helping to achieve national and state energy and climate goals, and new policies are 
now being developed that will promote future growth in the industry. 
 
Employment projections suggest that the workforce will need to expand rapidly to meet 
the increasing demand for energy efficiency products and services. Nationally, the 
greatest increase in number of jobs would likely be for insulation-related contracting 
(perhaps as many as 200,000 jobs by 2020).74 Energy services companies, government 
and utility efficiency programs, and weatherization programs could grow substantially in 
the coming years. Some estimates show the national energy efficiency workforce 
doubling by 2020, and there is potential for the employment in this sector to quadruple.75 
The energy efficiency industry in Washington State is large and mature, integrating 
technologies, industry sectors and occupations that span the economy. In the short term, 
federal stimulus investments will boost demand for skilled workers and new trainees, 
while investments in research and development and efficiency-related technologies will 
create new employment and business opportunities. 
 
The industry will face some serious challenges to developing the energy efficiency 
workforce of the future. The population in Washington is becoming more diverse, yet 
population trends show that the size of the state’s labor pool is likely to shrink over the 
next 20 years. Initial research shows that employers are already finding it difficult to find 
qualified workers to fill energy efficiency-related job openings at all levels, and new 
types of occupations and skill requirements are emerging.76 To meet current and 
projected needs, existing workers will need upgrade training to adapt to technology 
changes, new materials and work processes, while greater efforts will be needed to 
attract, train and recruit new workers to the industry. 
 
Some research on energy efficiency occupations and training needs have identified the 
need for stronger federal and state roles to support future growth in the energy efficiency 
industry. There may be opportunities for industry leaders and sponsors to augment their 
support for energy efficiency employment and training to accelerate the development of 
energy conservation solutions that address broader social, environmental and economic 
goals. However, the diverse nature of energy efficiency activities and the skills required

---


### Page 46

40 
 
by related industry sectors has complicated efforts to determine what specific industry 
sectors, occupational groups and workforce education programs should be emphasized. 
 
Systematic information about the employment and training needs of the industry at the 
state and regional levels is also lacking, and suggests that additional research is needed to 
identify specific skills and education requirements for the energy efficiency sector. 
Expansion of regional and state education and training capacity to support new growth in 
energy efficiency is needed, but efforts to adapt or expand the existing education and 
training infrastructure should be based on reliable data that includes input from the 
industry and other key stakeholders. 
 
Future Actions and Research 
In order for the state to maximize the potential of energy efficiency initiatives to address 
critical climate change, economic development and energy security goals, deliberate 
action must be taken to ensure the availability of a skilled energy efficiency workforce. 
This will require some immediate action steps be taken to attract, prepare and support the 
current and future workforce, but it is also recommended that additional research be 
conducted in order to fill some of the critical knowledge gaps about the labor and skill 
requirements of the industry. 
 
The Northwest Energy Efficiency Taskforce provides useful recommendations and 
strategies for regional coordination among utility and education partners that focus on 
identifying solutions for workforce development and future labor needs. This regional 
focus can also help guide the development of a broader strategy for supporting growth in 
the energy efficiency industry in the state. 
 
Some recommended actions steps and research for Washington include the following: 
• Support additional research that focuses specifically on the workforce 
development needs and labor markets of energy efficiency employers and 
employees in the region and the state. 
• Expand the number and scope of industry partnerships to identify employment 
needs, and the foundational skills and knowledge requirements, for key sectors of 
the energy efficiency industry. 
• Create new energy efficiency courses, certificates and degree programs and 
enhance existing programs to boost education and training system capacity. 
• Conduct and apply research on best practices, model curriculum, industry-defined 
skill standards, and certifications for current and future training programs. 
• Raise the visibility of energy efficiency careers and educational opportunities 
among youth and job seekers to expand the future workforce pipeline. 
• Support development of an industry and labor market information system that 
provides high quality data for energy efficiency-related labor markets, education 
and training opportunities and employment.

work or energy, measured as 1 kilowatt (1,000 watts) of power expended for 1 hour. One 
k Wh is equivalent to 3,412 Btu. One k Wh will operate a 40-watt light bulb for a full day, 
a 19" color television for about four hours, a personal computer for 2-1/2 hours, an 
electric hairdryer for 30 to 60 minutes, an electric razor for 36 hours, a clothes dryer for 
15 minutes, a microfurnace heater for 40 minutes, a clock radio for up to several days, a 
portable stereo for as long as a week, and a telephone answering machine for as long as a 
month. The typical Northwest household’s annual electrical use is 12,000 k Wh. 
 
Market transformation: Market transformation is a strategy that promotes the 
manufacture and purchase of energy-efficient products and services in order to induce 
lasting structural and behavioral changes in the marketplace and increase adoption of 
energy-efficient technologies. 
 
Megawatt (MW): A standard unit of electrical power equal to 1,000 kilowatts, or 1 
million watts. Like watts and kilowatts, the term “megawatt” is used as a standard 
measure of electric power plant generating capacity, although larger in scale. 
 
Megawatt-hour (MWh): 1 megawatt acting over a period of 1 hour. One megawatthour is equal to 1,000 kilowatt-hours or 1 million watt-hours. The primary difference 
between a megawatt and a megawatt-hour is that “megawatt” measures the capacity of an 
electric generator and “megawatt-hour” measures the actual amount of electricity it 
produces over a certain period of time. 
 
Quad: Quadrillion BTU.

Economic Drivers of Residential Demand 

Excerpts from “Economic Drivers of Residential Demand,” Draft Sixth Northwest 
Power Plan, Appendix B: Economic Forecast, page 3 and page 6, Northwest Power 
and Conservation Council, 
http://www.nwcouncil.org/library/2009/2009-03.htm 
 
The number of dwellings is a key driver of energy demand in the residential 
sector. Residential demand begins with the number of units, including single 
family, multifamily, and manufactured homes. This demand is forecast to grow at 
1.7 percent annually from 2010-2030. The current (2007) stock of 5.6 million 
homes is expected to grow to 7.6 million by 2030, or approximately 88,000 new 
homes per year. 
 
Another factor affecting residential demand for electricity is life-style trends. As 
more homes are linked to the internet and the saturation rate for air-conditioning 
appliances and electronic equipment increases, demand for electricity in the 
residential sector increases. Over 80 percent of all new homes in the region now 
have central air conditioning. This compares to 7-8 percent of housing stock with 
central air conditioning in the 1980s. Another change is the growth rate in home 
electronics, which has been phenomenal at over 6 percent per year since 2000, 
and which is expected to continue to increase. 
 
In the residential sector, electricity demand is driven by space heating and 
cooling, as well as refrigeration, cooking, washing, and a new category called 
Information, Communication and Entertainment (ICE). This new category 
includes all portable devices that must be charged, such as laptop computers and 
cell phones, as well as larger, more energy-intensive televisions and gaming 
devices. As the regional population grows, and with it the number of homes, 
demand for these and other appliances will also increase. The energy efficiency 
of appliances as dictated by state and federal standards, which appliances 
consumers buy, and how they use them, affect energy demand, as well. 
 
… 
 
While the number of occupants per household has declined, the square footage of 
homes has been increasing. According to the U.S. Bureau of Census’s annual 
survey of new homes, the average single-family house completed in 2007 had 
2,521 square feet, 801 more square feet than homes in 1977. Going back to the 
1950s, the average square footage of a new single-family home was about 983 
square feet. Over the past five decades, the average home size has grown by more 
than 250 percent. In 2007, 38 percent of new single-family homes had four or 
more bedrooms, almost twice the number of bedrooms in most homes built 20

years ago. In addition, 90 percent of these new homes had air conditioning. 
These changes have meant an increased demand for space conditioning and 
lighting.

Energy Efficiency Education and Training 
 
Washington State offers a number of postsecondary education and training opportunities 
focused on advancing energy efficiency knowledge and skills, however relatively few 
offer energy efficiency as a dedicated program. Many programs include energy 
efficiency within broader subjects such as in environmental sciences, buildings sciences 
or engineering. This list emphasizes community and technical college programs in 
Washington with either a primary focus in efficiency or which may have significant 
relevance to the energy efficiency industry. 
 
In addition to the list of degrees, certificates and courses below, Washington State has 
eleven colleges that have been named “Centers of Excellence.” Each Center focuses on 
an industry which is strategic to the economic growth of a region or state. The Centers 
are Washington’s hubs for education and training, resources for industry, educators, and 
colleges, and for convening state and regional workforce networks. Two of these centers, 
the Center of Excellence for Energy Technology at Centralia Community College and the 
Construction Center of Excellence at Renton Technical College, have common interests 
with the energy efficiency industry. 
 
Please note this list was compiled in June, 2009 and may not include all programs. 
Course offerings change frequently.

27 NWPCC 6th Plan Demand Forecast (pg 7): http://www.nwcouncil.org/library/2009/2009-03.htm 
28 NWPCC Draft 6th plan, Summary of Key Findings “The Council identified just under 7,000 average 
megawatts of technically achievable conservation potential in the medium demand forecast by the end of 
the forecast period, at a levelized (net) life-cycle cost of up to $200 per megawatt-hour (2006 dollars). 
Sources of potential savings are about 50 percent higher than in the Fifth Power Plan. The assessment is 
higher for two principal reasons. First, the Council identified new sources of savings in areas not addressed 
in the Fifth Power Plan: consumer electronics, outdoor lighting, and the utility distribution system. Second, 
savings potential has increased significantly in the residential sector as a result of technology improvements 
and in the industrial sector as a result of a more detailed conservation assessment. Not all of the 7,000 
average megawatts identified will prove to be cost-effective to develop. The Council uses its portfolio 
model to identify the amount of conservation that can be economically developed.”
