Introduction A robust and well-trained workforce is essential to developing domestic wind power projects to meet future energy demands. The future wind power workforce will include manufacturing, siting, operations, maintenance, education, and research capabilities. How prepared is the United States to train future employees in the wind industry? The purpose of this research is to better understand: • Today’s domestic wind workforce • Projected future workforce needs • Whether existing and new training and educational programs meet the wind industry's future needs. Results presented in this report provide the first published investigation into the detailed makeup of the wind energy workforce as well as a glance at the educational infrastructure and training needs of the wind industry. Insights from this research into the domestic wind workforce will allow the private sector, educational institutions, and federal and state governmental organizations to make better informed workforce-related decisions based on the current data and future projections. Methods After completing a literature review of publicly available reports, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) researchers learned that a U.S. wind workforce or labor assessment had not been performed on a national scale. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) funded NREL to assess the existing wind workforce with an emphasis on skills and training. Using projections from the report 20% Wind Energy by 2030: Increasing Wind Energy’s Contribution to U.S. Electricity Supply (U.S. DOE 2008; hereafter referred to as 20% Wind by 2030), we estimated future industry needs and will compare them to existing wind training programs. This enables NREL to provide information to DOE about whether the United States needs to increase the number of educators and students attending wind training programs to meet wind deployment goals. Our research had five components: 1) Conduct a wind industry employer survey 2) Compile an evolving catalog of wind-specific education and training programs 3) Correlate employer preferences with available education and training programs 4) Project new hires needed in the wind workforce to account for growth needed for the 20% Wind by 2030 scenario 5) Estimate the number of graduates needed by program type (e.g., graduate-level course, community college degree). The following sections describe the methods used for each of these components.\n\n---\n\n### Page 8\n\n2 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications. Conduct Wind Industry Employer Survey The first component of our research was a wind industry employer survey to better understand the size of the domestic wind workforce and the distribution of occupations across the wind industry supply chain, as well as to assess the level and types of education, training, and experience preferred by employers when making hiring decisions. To conduct the survey, NREL hired BW Research Partnership, a firm experienced in workforce surveys and analyses. Survey data were collected in August and September 2012. Employers first received the survey via e-mail. BW Research initiated a phone survey for employers who did not respond online. Appendix D of this report contains the full survey questionnaire The total survey size consisted of approximately 1,900 contacts from the commercial-scale wind energy industry, and we received 418 completed responses. Industry contacts for the survey came from various sources, including the membership lists of the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) and Windustry, and contacts within NREL’s OpenEI and Wind Powering America contact databases.1 The detailed questions for employers concerning each occupation included: • Level of difficulty in finding qualified applicants (by occupation) • Importance of occupational experience versus wind-specific experience • Preferred educational attainment for new hires • Employers’ preferences for wind energy training and education • Importance of wind energy college degrees versus degrees not related to wind energy • Female representation in the wind energy workforce by occupation. The questionnaire included 35 occupations divided among 15 wind industry company classifications, such as project development, turbine manufacturing, installation, and operation (see Table 1). These occupations and wind industry company classifications were developed by several NREL employees, each with extensive wind energy experience, specifically for this survey. Suitable Bureau of Labor Statistics Standard Occupational Classification codes do not currently exist for the full breadth of occupations within wind energy and thus could not be used. The 35 occupations were selected from a larger list of wind industry jobs (the fewer number of occupations allows focus while still demonstrating the wide diversity of occupations across the industry). Several occupations (e.g., administrative or clerical) existed in more than one wind industry classification. The questionnaire asked employers to select a primary industry classification for their company (from a list of 15) and then asked them to select which occupational categories best represent their employees (from a list of 5 to 8). Of course, many companies employ more than five to eight occupations, so our list was not exhaustive and instead focused on the most prevalent wind occupations within that industry classification. 1 http://en.openei.org/wiki/Main_Page and http://www.windpoweringamerica.gov\n\n---\n\n### Page 9\n\n3 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications. To maximize response rates and minimize the number of incomplete surveys, questions and response options were structured to allow respondents to complete the survey within a 15-minute timeframe. This is a standard threshold to minimize fatigue and dropout (Jordan 2012). For instance, if an employer noted that his company employed all eight occupations listed for his industry classification, detailed questions of only four of these occupations, chosen randomly, would be asked of this employer. Table 1 shows which occupations were included in each industry classification. The green boxes indicate that the occupation was present in the industry classification.\n\n---\n\n### Page 10\n\n4 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications.

After data collection, we aggregated jobs within similar occupational categories to minimize redundancy and adjusted occupation names for clarity as needed. We also deleted one occupational role as only two companies claimed to employ that position. In the end, we performed our full analysis on 26 occupations in the wind industry. Table 2.

Catalog Wind-Specific Education and Training Programs The second component of this study was to catalog available wind-specific education and training programs to learn about the number of graduates and percentages of graduates working in the wind industry. We conducted the cataloging by searching post-secondary schools’ and educational organizations’ websites to identify wind-specific programs in the United States. We searched websites of schools previously identified by Wind Powering America as having some association to wind energy education. We documented classes, degrees, research, and major resources (e.g., a working wind turbine that could be utilized for training). We categorized degrees as Certificate, Associate's, Bachelor's, Master’s, and Ph.D. The catalog only includes information on programs focusing on wind energy or renewable energy with a large portion of the curriculum devoted to wind. The program title or description must include the word “wind” or “renewable.” After we cataloged a school’s programs, we sent an e-mail to professors and administrators asking them to 1) review the school’s publicly available program descriptions for completeness and accuracy, 2) enumerate how many people graduated from each program, and of those, 3) identify what portion proceeded to work in the wind industry, if known. NREL researchers aggregated the responses from these schools to create a dataset of wind-specific education and training programs. An example is shown in Table 3. This example shows a single degree program from a single school; many schools offer multiple programs. Table 3. Sample Educational Program Type of School School Name Extent of Wind Focus (Credential, Courses, Research, Resource) Program (Ph.D., Master's, Bachelor's, Associate's, Certificate) Name of Program/ Concentration Graduates per Year Number Entering Wind Industry Percent Entering Wind Industry Universities University of Your State Credential Master's Graduate Program in Renewable Energy Development 10 3 30% 

Correlate Employer Preferences with Available Education and Training Programs The next phase involved connecting employers' preferences regarding education level attained for each occupation with wind-specific programs that meet those preferences. To achieve this, we focused on two questions from our employer survey. • Q7: preferred educational attainment for new hires • Q8: the importance of wind-specific experience, certification, and education vs. occupational-focused education that is not specific to wind.\n\n---\n\n### Page 13\n\n7 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications. In the example in Table 4, we see that employers most frequently preferred a graduate-level education for research engineers. However, some employers only required a bachelor degree, while some wanted a post-bachelor professional certification. We utilized the full range of employer responses in our analysis. Table 4. Example of Employer Educational Preference for an Occupation High School Diploma Post-Secondary Professional Certificate (Journeyman, Trade/Technical Programs) Associate's Degree Bachelor's Degree Post- Bachelor Professional Certification (e.g., CPA, PE, LEED) Master's Degree, Ph.D., or Law Research engineers 0% 0% 0% 17% 11% 71% We also need to understand whether employers require this degree to be wind-specific because one focus of this research is whether enough wind-specific training and educational programs are available. To achieve this, we examined the ratio of employers preferring wind-specific college degrees to degrees not focused on wind (or for the few occupations that do not require some type of college degree, we look at a similar ratio concerning professional certification). Table 5 shows the percentage of employers indicating that they felt it was "very" or "somewhat" important for employees in this particular occupation to have the specific degree. Table 5. Example of Relative Importance of Wind-Specific Degree College Degree Wind-Specific College Degree Ratio of Importance of Wind- Specific College Degree vs. Degree Not Specific to Wind Research engineers 97% 48% 50% In the case of research engineers, we found that approximately half as many employers rated a wind energy-specific degree as important relative to a general college degree. For our analysis, we multiply responses from Q7 (Table 4) by responses to Q8 (Table 5) to determine the percentage of wind-specific degrees that are needed by occupation, by degree level. To determine whether the United States will have enough qualified employees to meet future labor needs of the wind industry, we need to answer such questions as: • How many new employees in a given occupation will the wind industry require over the next 20 years? • How many participants of qualifying programs will graduate each year? The final two steps of the analysis enable us to begin to answer these questions.\n\n---\n\n### Page 14\n\n8 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications. Project New Wind Workforce Hires Needed for the 20% Wind by 2030 Scenario The wind employer survey estimated that approximately 70,000 people are currently employed in the United States in the wind energy industry.2 As construction continues each year and cumulative installed capacity increases, the U.S. wind industry will require more workers. By associating the current workforce with capacity installed3 in 2012 (12 GW) and cumulative installed capacity (59 GW in 2012), we can estimate increases needed in the wind labor workforce to meet annual installation schedules described in DOE’s 20% Wind by 2030 modeled energy scenario. Such a projection includes estimates for increases in production efficiency per worker, as well as attrition due to people leaving the industry to retire or pursue other careers. The authors understand that the scenario as represented in the 20% Wind by 2030 report is only one potential scenario that the wind industry could follow. Readers should consider projections in this report indicative of future industry needs, based on current workforce trends, assuming a strong future marketplace for wind energy development as outlined in the 2008 DOE report. Estimate Number of Graduates Needed by Degree Type After we estimate how many new employees we might need per occupation by year, we apply our calculated percentage requiring a wind-specific degree of a given level. This indicates how many graduates with wind-specific degrees are needed per year. By adjusting this figure by the likelihood of these graduates to enter the wind industry after graduation and how many students graduate from each program per year, we can develop an estimate of how many programs are needed at each degree level. Our analysis focuses on the needs of the peak hiring year for the industry (2016 for most occupations; 2019 for occupations in the operations and maintenance (O&M) sector). The results are estimates based on the data we obtained, which are limited by the small sample size of education and training programs. Results Wind Industry Employer Survey As stated, NREL hired a contractor to conduct a wind industry employer survey for which we had approximately 1,900 contacts in the utility-scale wind energy industry.4 We received 418 valid responses. Appendix C of this report contains the full survey questionnaire. The following results are based on stated preferences of our sample of wind energy employers. While our total sample consisted of more than 400 employers, since these employers occupied different positions within the supply chain (and hence employed different occupations), any single occupation included responses with a base size of employers ranging from nine to 131. About half the occupations included responses from 30 or more employers. Table 6 lists occupations ranked from high to low based on the percentage of companies citing “great difficulty” finding qualified applicants for a given occupation. Overall, wind employers were more likely to state they had “some difficulty” finding qualified applicants, as opposed to 2 See Appendix D for an explanation of how we estimated the approximately 70,000 employees. 3 12 GW of capacity installed in 2012 was the estimated end of year figure as of November 2012. Actual installations came in slightly higher at 13 GW. 4 Educational institutions were also included in the survey if they offered wind education programs.\n\n---\n\n### Page 15\n\n9 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications. “great difficulty.” According to this survey, the most difficult positions to fill are professors and teachers. Table 6. Level of Difficulty in Finding Qualified Applicants (by Occupation) Some Difficulty Great Difficulty Some or Great Difficulty Professors & teachers 41% 43% 84% Product designers 40% 35% 75% Trade workers 40% 31% 71% Manufacturing salespeople 33% 31% 64% Wind technicians 50% 29% 79% Construction managers 44% 28% 72% Professional trainers 50% 27% 77% Development technical specialists 47% 26% 74% Engineers 42% 25% 66% Scientists 48% 24% 71% Research engineers 47% 22% 69% Managers of sales, operations, & training 40% 22% 61% Attorneys 26% 18% 44% Transportation/logistics workers 24% 18% 41% Land-leasing agents 31% 15% 46% Development managers 37% 15% 52% Paralegals 33% 11% 44% Supply chain & purchasing managers 44% 10% 54% Construction laborers 67% 7% 73% Resource assessors & surveyors 39% 6% 44% Development finance 35% 5% 40% Admin/clerical 31% 4% 35% Manufacturing managers 72% 2% 74% Government regulatory workers 73% 0% 73% O&M accountants & bookkeepers 60% 0% 60% Assembly workers 67% 0% 67% Average 45% 17% 62% 

Table 7 compares employers’ preferences for new hires with wind-specific work experience relative to general occupational experience. The data are ranked by the ratio of importance of each of these types of work experience. Across all occupations, wind employers agreed that it was more important that new hires have experience in their occupational field over wind-specific experience. Those roles near the top of the table represent the positions for which wind industry experience requirements are almost as important as general experience in the occupation.

In Table 8, occupations are ranked from high to low by required educational achievement (mean years; not directly shown in chart). The yellow highlighting represents the most common response per occupation. Wind industry employers require a wide range of educational levels for the different occupations they hire. The most common educational achievement required was a bachelor's degree; several occupations required an advanced degree. Employers preferred that trade workers, wind technicians, and assembly workers have some form of post-high school professional training and that construction workers have a high school diploma. Table 9 compares the importance of three levels of wind energy-specific training by occupation: • Courses, conferences, workshops • Professional certification • Wind energy-specific college degree. The table is ranked high to low on the first column of data. Yellow highlighted text represents 40% or more of wind employers rating wind energy-specific professional certification or a wind-specific college degree as "very or somewhat important." This applies to a minority of occupations. By comparing the average across the three, we see that wind employers desire their new hires to have been exposed to some basic level of wind energy training, but requirements for professional certification or wind-specific college degrees are not important for the majority of occupations in the wind industry. Please note that wind energy-specific programs are recent developments. Thus, it is possible that employers not rating these programs as important may be due to the fact that until recently, few if any were available.\n\n---\n\n### Page 19\n\n13 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications.

Table 10 compares the relative importance of a wind-specific college degree to that of a college degree that is not specifically focused on wind energy. The table is ranked high to low on this ratio, which is shown in the far right column. With the exception of a few occupations, only a minority of employers required college degrees specific to wind energy. All employers requiring wind technicians and assembly workers to hold a college degree felt that it is important that the degree is specific to wind energy. Approximately half of wind employers claimed that it was important for new hires to have a wind-specific degree in the occupations of development technical specialists, research engineers, and professors/teachers.

Table 11 exhibits the percentage of female wind employees by occupation. Employers' responses indicate that the vast majority of paralegals, administrative staff, and government regulatory workers in the wind industry are female (more than 80%). The majority of O&M accountants/bookkeepers, supply chain/purchasing managers, and development finance employees are women. Women made up less than 20% of employees in 12 of the 26 occupations studied during this research. Responses to survey questions asking about minority representation (including women) tend to overstate the number of minorities in a business if that minority is a protected class of worker (Jordan 2012).

Cataloging Wind-Specific Education and Training Programs The table below summarizes the number of schools we contacted, how many responded, and of the responses, how many were completed thoroughly enough to use in our analysis. Eighteen schools provided complete information. Table 12. Response Rate (Number of Schools) E-mails sent 49 Responses returned 31 63% of mail sent Quality data 18 58% of responses 37% of mail sent 

Many schools offered multiple degrees. Of the 18 schools that provided thorough feedback, on average we received data for two to three programs per school. Thus, respondents provided information about 43 programs. The distribution of programs across degree levels is shown in Table 13. Table 13. Distribution of Degree Program Levels in Response Set Program Count 8 Post-secondary certificate 10 Associate's degree 4 Undergraduate certificate 8 Bachelor's degree 1 Graduate certificate 8 Master's degree 4 Ph.D. 43 Total Of the 43 programs, 18 are at the community or technical college level and 25 are university programs. Table 14 lists summary statistics about post-secondary wind-specific educational programs and their graduates. The mean number of graduates per year from university programs is almost three times the median, indicating a strong skew generated by a few large programs in this sampling. Results show that the percentage of community or technical college graduates who move into the wind industry after graduation is significantly higher than that of university graduates. This is likely due to the fact that 1- and 2-year technical programs offered by community colleges are tailored toward careers in wind energy more than higher-level degrees. Even though we attempted to focus our efforts on wind-specific degrees in university programs, many of these programs included wind energy content in addition to content on other renewables such as solar. These programs also included broad engineering disciplines utilized across a wide range of industries, including aerospace, utilities, and civil construction. Thus, the lower percentage of graduates entering the wind energy field from university programs may be due to a wider variety of opportunities available to these graduates.\n\n---\n\n### Page 23\n\n17 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications.

Summary of Employer Educational Preferences We derived Table 15 by combining employer survey responses to questions #7 and #8 in the questionnaire. 5 We examined the percentage of employers rating a wind energy-specific degree/certification as somewhat or very important in their hiring criteria, relative to a college degree/certification that is not wind-specific. We multiplied these ratios (importance of wind energy-specific versus a more general focus) by the preferred educational attainment for new hires by occupation. The resulting data reveal the percentage of new hires that should have a wind-specific degree or certification by occupation to meet employers’ preferences. Table 15 should be read across rows. For instance, these data indicate that 45% of employers prefer that a newly hired wind technician have a wind energy-specific professional certificate, while 17% want a wind-specific associate's degree. One can infer from this that 38% [100%- (45%+17%)] do not consider it important for their new wind technicians to have wind-specific education of this level. For example, perhaps the employer is willing to hire and train a new employee for this role if the new hire has experience in a relevant line of work. 

5 Q7: preferred educational attainment for new hires; Q8: the importance of wind-specific experience, certification, and education vs. occupational-focused education that is not specific to wind. The much lower percentages of university graduates entering the wind industry compared to 1- and 2-year programs are due in part to the fact that university-level wind programs are not as narrowly focused on wind energy and also often include other renewable technologies such as solar and other specialties such as aerospace and civil construction.\n\n---\n\n### Page 24\n\n18 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications.

Project New Hires in Wind Workforce Needed for the 20% Wind by 2030 Scenario To estimate new hires in the wind workforce, we began with our employer survey data, which served as a baseline of current wind industry employees as of August 2012, by occupation. Then we used the table below to project the future workforce. Most occupations were linked to annual gigawatts installed. For instance, the 20% Wind by 2030 scenario indicates that 14 GW of wind will need to be installed in 2016 (DOE 2008), 17% more than in 2012. Thus, we assume that some segments of the wind workforce need to expand by that percentage to meet the increase in installations, all else being equal. However, all else is not equal each year. Our model also included two other factors: attrition at an average rate of 7% per year6 and labor productivity increases of 1% to 3% annually, depending on occupation (Bloomberg 2012). Our attrition figure only accounts for retirement and individuals choosing to leave the wind industry and does not adjust for people who remain in the wind industry but move to a new company as that does not impact the number of new employees needed. As stated previously, 20% Wind by 2030 is only one industry growth scenario; if wind deployment continues above this amount, an expanded workforce would be expected. If deployment is slower than that represented in this scenario, a smaller workforce will be the likely outcome. 

6 Attrition figures are derived from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (accessed December 26, 2012: http://www.bls.gov/news.release/ecopro.htm).\n\n---\n\n### Page 26\n\n20 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications.

Jobs in the O&M sector were projected based on the growth of total cumulative installed capacity, not annual installations. The following jobs are found in the O&M sector in our survey: Table 17. Percent of Selected Occupations from the Survey in the O&M Sector Wind technicians Primarily O&M Greater than 70% O&M accountants & bookkeepers Significant O&M Greater than 30%, less than 70% Managers of sales, operations, & training Significant O&M Greater than 30%, less than 70% Attorneys Some O&M Less than 30% Admin/clerical Some O&M Less than 30% Engineers Some O&M Less than 30% These jobs are also found in other supply chain sectors, thus the relationship of their growth with increases in cumulative installations is correlated with the proportion of these jobs based in the O&M sector. Table 17 groups these occupations into Primarily O&M, Significant O&M, and Some O&M to clarify this relationship. 

Figure 1. Wind employment projections to reach 20% Wind by 2030 (with average productivity increases of 2% and attrition of 7%) The growth of the wind industry included in this report follows projections outlined in 20% Wind by 2030. This analysis did not attempt to assess whether these estimates of wind capacity installations were accurate or likely. We simply used these projections, with an adjustment to 2013 for the expected reduction in installations, to estimate the projected change in employment overall, as well as by occupation. Total Employement Change in Employment vs. Previous Year New Employees Needed (40,000) (30,000) (20,000) (10,000) - 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 70,000 80,000 90,000 100,000 110,000 Employees\n\n---\n\n### Page 28\n\n22 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications. The wind industry is expecting a significant reduction in wind employment in 2013 because Congress did not renew the Production Tax Credit until January.7 Based on projected installations of 5 GW in 2013, this analysis does not anticipate an increase in wind industry employment in the near term. In fact, reductions in workforce are likely to occur. Assuming a resolution of the issues leading to this expected decline by 2014 and continuance on the path outlined in the 20% Wind by 2030 scenario, most of those who lost their jobs in 2013 will be needed again, as well as almost 2,000 new employees. After that, 12,000 to 14,000 new employees per year will be needed from 2015 to 2018. From 2019 through 2027, 8,000 to 9,000 new employees will be needed per year. Total employment declines for the remaining 3 years should occur as projections for new installations in the 20% Wind by 2030 scenario begin to taper off. For these final 3 years, the new employees needed are primarily due to attrition replacement. Table 18 breaks down our estimates of the number of new employees that will be needed by year and by occupation in the utility-scale wind sector. These estimates account for changes in capacity installed per year, attrition due to retirement and people choosing to leave the wind industry, and improvements in worker productivity. One can readily see that the largest demand is for wind technicians, as the number of technicians will continue to increase each year as the cumulative number of turbines installed in the United States grows. Further, many occupations are not accounted for in this research (see the last table row). Due to time constraints with our employer survey (to reduce respondent fatigue), we attempted to collect information on the most common occupations, but many job functions were not included. Light blue boxes in Table 18 indicate that no new employees are needed for that occupation during that year (in fact, in 2013 it’s expected that many employees will be dismissed). We assume that employees laid off in 2013 are rehired in 2014 or 2015, before new employees are hired. This is why so few occupations require new employees in 2014. The number needed in 2015 is still muted due to expected rehiring of employees who lost their jobs in 2013. Green boxes in Table 18 represent the high point year of new workers needed. For most occupations, this occurs in 2016 when the increase in annual capacity installed is 2 GW above the prior year and the previous peak annual installation in 2012. The next 2 years show increases in annual capacity installed of 1 GW versus the prior year. After that, the number of new workers needed each year declines as only attrition replacement is needed; there are no increases to annual capacity installed (it levels out at 16 GW per year). Since productivity increases are built into the model as well, not all employees lost due to attrition require replacement. For those occupations primarily in the O&M sector, peak hiring occurs in 2019. The decline in the number of new employees needed is minimal for these occupations, as they are correlated with cumulative installed capacity (which continues to increase). The increase in cumulative installed capacity is steady after 2019, and productivity increases cause the slight decline in the number of new hires needed. 7 According to a study by Navigant Consulting, half the jobs in the wind industry and hundreds of U.S. factories could be lost by the first quarter of 2013 if the Production Tax Credit was allowed to expire on December 31 (AWEA Press Release; December 21, 2012).\n\n---\n\n### Page 29\n\n23 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications.

Table 20 details graduates per year by wind-specific degree level, as well as the percentage of these graduates who move on to work in wind energy (keeping in mind that programs self-reported). While most graduates with wind-specific degrees from community and technical colleges do proceed to work in wind energy, the same cannot be said for university graduates. We believe a primary reason for this is that the university-level degree programs tend to be less focused on wind energy careers. The course work at the university level is broader (e.g., “Renewable Energy Policy” with a unit on wind power) and allows graduates to pursue more career paths. Table 20.

Table 21 shows the progression from the number of desired new hires with a wind energy- specific degree/certification to the number of graduates needed, given that not all graduates enter the wind industry. According to our data set, this may be an obstacle for university programs but not for community college programs in the future. The final step involves dividing the number of graduates needed by the estimated graduating class size to determine the number of educational programs needed, assuming that the class sizes remain similar to 2012 class sizes. Appendix A explains how we estimated the number of wind-focused programs currently available to potential students. With the exception of associate’s degree programs, it appears a shortfall exists in currently available training programs relative to projections of industry demand. Table 21. Calculating Number of Wind Energy-Specific Programs Needed to Fulfill Projected Industry Demand (rounded to the nearest 10 with the exception of graduates per year) Degree/ Certificate Maximum New Hires Needed with Wind- Specific Degrees/ Certificates Type of Institution Offering Estimated Percent of Graduates Entering Wind Industry 8 Number Needed to Graduate in Max Year Estimated Graduates Per Program Per Year 9 # of Programs Needed in United States* # of Programs Currently Available Difference Post-secondary professional certificate (journeyman, trade/technical programs) 2,750 Community & tech colleges 83% 3,310 14 240 70 170 Associate's degree 1000 Community & tech colleges 1,200 90 90 0 Bachelor's degree 800 University 13% 6,120 23 270 20 250 Post-bachelor's professional certification (e.g., CPA, PE, LEED) 210 University 1,630 70 NA NA Master's degree, Ph.D., or Law 550 University 4,250 190 20 170 * Please see Appendices B and C for scenarios that explain how new employees could be trained without such a significant increase in number of programs. A few important caveats must be considered for Table 21. The table shows the percentage of graduates who entered the wind industry in the recent past based on a relatively small survey of educational institutions. Although a small percentage of university graduates with wind-specific degrees entered the wind industry in the past year or two, this does not necessarily mean that the same percentage will follow suit in the future. If the wind industry needs these graduates, they could competitively pursue them. Further, one must consider that the average class size provided by each school does not necessarily represent the maximum number of people who could graduate from each program. 8 These estimates are the average of the mean and median figures presented in Table 20. 9 Ibid.\n\n---\n\n### Page 33\n\n27 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications. While the potential expansion of class size was not included in our original school survey, we followed up with a small collection of university programs to determine whether enrollment in these degree programs was at maximum capacity or if additional students could be added without significant increases in expenditures. The four universities we discussed this issue with provided 14 wind-specific degree programs. Of these 14 programs, half claimed that educating additional students would require additional resources. The other half claimed that enrollment could increase without adding significant additional capital or human resources. Of the seven degree programs with available expansion, the schools reported that on average the number of graduates could double before significant additional resources would be required (see Appendix B for details). Thus, if we combine these two factors and adjust our estimates accordingly, we would see that the number of additional educational programs required declines drastically relative to what is shown in Table 21. While these assumptions clearly reduce the magnitude of the shortfall, a shortfall is still apparent between the number of currently available programs and the number that will be needed to educate the workforce required to meet wind capacity growth outlined in the 20% Wind by 2030 report. Appendix C details this alternate scenario. Conclusions Employer Preferences for Wind Energy Training and Education In most cases, employers rate experience in a relevant occupational field as more important in the hiring decision than experience in the wind energy industry. Hiring qualified candidates is generally considered “somewhat difficult,” as opposed to “very difficult.” The most difficult-to- fill positions are professors and teachers, followed by product design engineers. Employers require a wide range of educational levels for their new hires. The most commonly required level of education is a bachelor's degree, although several occupations require an advanced degree. Exceptions to this include trade workers, assembly workers, and wind technicians (generally requiring some form of post-high school professional certification) and construction laborers (requiring a high school degree or equivalent). Employers prefer candidates exposed to some form of wind energy training, but requirements for wind-specific professional certification or wind-specific college degrees are not the norm among the majority of employers. Wind industry employers only rank energy-specific professional certification as somewhat or very important for four occupations: professional trainers, research engineers, professors and teachers, and technical specialists. All employers believing it is important for wind technicians and assembly workers to hold a college degree feel that this degree should be wind energy-specific. Across all occupational classifications, fewer than 50% of employers cite a wind energy-specific college degree as “somewhat important” or “very important.” Availability and Graduation Rates of Wind Workforce Training and Educational Programs A wide variety of program levels are offered, from 1-year post-secondary certificates to Ph.D. programs. Many of these programs are newer, and current graduation rates may underestimate\n\n---\n\n### Page 34\n\n28 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications. their future potential. Our sample did not include training courses that are offered outside of educational institutions, such as employer-sponsored short courses that provide field experience. Associate's degrees and 1-year post-secondary certificates are more likely to definitively prepare graduates for work in the wind energy industry, as a high percentage of graduates move on to work in wind. University degree programs, including bachelor's degrees and higher, are much less likely to see their graduates enter the wind energy workforce. For university-level programs, this percentage may appear surprisingly low given that we are focusing on wind energy-specific degree programs. But as stated, most of the university degree programs had a broader curriculum than the community and technical colleges, which thus enabled graduates to pursue opportunities in a variety of industries. Women in the Wind Industry According to our survey, which only captures a segment of the domestic wind industry, women comprise approximately 20% of the known wind workforce. The variance across occupations is large. Six occupations of the 26 in our survey exhibited a majority of women in their workforce. These six included paralegals, admin/clerical, government regulatory workers, operations and maintenance accountants/bookkeepers, supply chain/purchasing managers, and development finance. The occupations with the lowest female representation were assembly workers, construction laborers, transportation/logistics workers, and wind technicians, each with less than 10%. One note of caution in this section is that according to BW Research staff, companies asked about numbers of female employees tend to over-report the number of women working in their company (Jordan 2012). Growth of the Wind Workforce Extrapolating the responses to our survey indicates that the wind workforce segment we have captured contains approximately 70,000 employees as of 2012. This is an educated assessment of the employers included in our research, not the entire U.S. wind industry. Of the workers we counted, most are employed in the utility-scale wind sector (~66,000), as opposed to smaller- scale commercial wind projects (~3,000). Following the capacity growth described in the 20% Wind by 2030 scenario, our methods project that the United States will require a wind industry workforce of approximately 105,000 by 2027 (including direct jobs and some supply chain jobs, but no induced jobs). In 2016, when the United States is projected to install 16 GW per year, the largest number of new hire workers is expected. Additional hires are needed each year to replace attrition, as well as for the continued growth of occupations that fall within the O&M sector. The number of O&M workers continues to grow as this figure is correlated with cumulative installed capacity, as opposed to annual capacity installed. In the long run, the number of new employees required each year declines over time as our modeling included anticipated increases in worker productivity. Growth in Educational Programs Focusing on Wind Energy For this report, we assumed that the sample data we collected on class size and the transition from school to industry are representative of all such educational programs (even though our sample was small). To meet the peak demands for an educated and well-trained wind workforce, the U.S. wind industry would need hundreds of degree programs focusing on wind energy. Based on our estimates, the United States would need approximately 250 to 300 post-secondary\n\n---\n\n### Page 35\n\n29 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications. professional certification programs, 80 to 120 associate's degree programs, 200 to 250 bachelor's degree programs, 40 to 80 post-bachelor's professional certification programs, and 125 to 175 master's level or higher programs. Given the 20% Wind by 2030 scenario, this peak demand for new hires generally occurs in 2016 for university graduates and 2019 for community college graduates. This number of programs is a sizable increase from what is currently available, with the exception of associate’s degree programs. Alternative methods to produce enough graduates include increasing the number of students per year per program (e.g., increase class size), or in the case of university graduates, developing industry-university collaborations that help steer a greater number of qualified graduates into the wind industry, such as internships. However, a shortfall would still exist, unless new programs are created. References American Wind Energy Association.

Appendix A: Estimate of U.S. Wind-Specific Degree Programs Table 22 shows our best estimate of the number of wind-specific programs currently available in the United States. We derived this estimate by combining AWEA’s educational program database10 with Wind Power America’s educational database,11 resulting in 202 programs. We then compared Windustry’s school program list12 with our list. Of the 37 programs listed by Windustry, 35 were also found on our aggregate list (a 95% match). However, it is logical to assume that the less-publicized programs would not be included in either of our lists, so we chose to lower this coverage factor from 95% to 90%. We then divided the number of programs in our list (202) by this 90% coverage factor, which increases our overall count estimate to 224. Table 22.

Appendix C: Alternate Scenario Produces Outcome with Smaller Shortfall of Programs Following Table 21 in the report, we noted two factors that if considered would significantly reduce the number of additional wind energy educational programs that would need to be created to meet growing industry demand. In Table 24, we show the impact of employing these two factors in an alternate projection. First, we increased the percentage of university graduates that chose to enter the wind industry upon graduation. Several factors could generate such an outcome, such as greater strategic recruiting by the industry, higher salaries, expanding internship programs, program scholarships and more. If we split the difference between the 13% estimate of those entering the wind industry among university graduates with the 83% estimate for community and technical colleges, we arrive at a 43% placement rate. If we use the limited data we obtained for the possibility of expanding graduates per program, without schools needing to invest significant additional resources (i.e., just fill up empty seats in class), we would get a 50% increase in graduates per program per year (from 14 to 21 for community/ technical colleges and from 23 to 34 for university programs). Table 24 shows the results of using these two alternative inputs. We can see that the number of programs required declines drastically relative to what is shown in Table 21. While these assumptions clearly reduce the magnitude of the shortfall, a shortfall is still apparent between the number of currently available programs and the number that will be needed to educate the workforce required to meet wind capacity growth outlined in the 20% Wind by 2030 report.

Appendix D: BW Research Method for Estimating Today’s Wind Power Employees Note: BW Research provided this explanation. Based on the sampling of wind companies conducted in August and September 2012, BW Research Partnership estimates that the 15 selected domestic wind industry segments13 employ 69,126 workers.14 To derive this estimate, BW Research first split the responses into two categories – those that reported working with large systems (i.e., utility-scale and large commercial wind turbines) and those that were pre-identified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) as working with smaller (typically residential) systems.15 Mean wind employment was derived for each category (large = 27.32 workers; small = 13.71 workers). In addition to mean employment, BW Research calculated the number of firms in each category. For large firms, the initial database (derived from AWEA membership lists, OpenEI, Windustry, NREL, and other sources) included 3,023 firms. NREL pre-identified 48 firms for the small firm database. A description of each process is detailed below. Large-Wind Process To calculate the number of large-wind firms, BW Research calculated several factors to refine the database. The first of these, churn, uses a ratio of calls reaching dead air, disconnections, fast-busy, wrong number, or no business locations, to the total number of telephone attempts made. This rate of 5.65% is then applied to the total firm database of 3,023. Next, a “not-in-United States” rate is applied, similar to the above, for all firms that were asked the question (in this case, 38 of the 502 firms that reached the screener indicated that they were not located in the United States, a rate of 7.57%). This ratio is then applied to the post-churn database. Ninety-one of the 463 respondents (19.65%) reported that their firms do not conduct wind- related activities, which again is applied to the database. Finally, 30 of the 392 firms that were asked reported that they were small firms (thereby terminating) for a rate of 7.65%.16 Once each of these rates is applied, the 3,023 firms are reduced to 2,045 firms that are active, domestic, large-wind firms. 13 It is important to note that several industry segments were not included for study, such as government. Other firms that are far removed from final goods and services, such as mining, smelting, etc., are also excluded due to said firms’ inability to accurately allocate workers supporting the wind energy portions of their business. 14 For the purposes of this memorandum, a “worker” is an employee that spends a majority of his or her time supporting the wind portion of the business. This is used as a reasonable proxy for full-time equivalent workers (FTEs) but is not interchangeable. 15 Any firms that reported being “small” and were not pre-identified by NREL were terminated. 16 Other factors, such as refusals, are excluded from the churn analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Page 40\n\n34 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications. Based on our research in other sectors, including national solar studies, we estimate that the original database accounts for approximately 85% of all firms. If this same rate is assumed in the current instance, the number of firms that meet the screener definition of a “wind firm” is 2,406. When this figure is multiplied by the (question 2) mean wind energy employment of 27.32, the result is 65,729 workers.17 Small-Wind Process With a much smaller sample size, BW Research conducted a churn rate that included all relevant screen-outs. In the sample of 48 firms, 42 were attempted by telephone, and six were screen- outs, for a total churn rate of 14.29%. This reduces the overall universe to 41 firms. In addition to these 41 firms, BW Research added approximately 169 small-wind firms that were deleted from the large universe sample for reporting that they worked with small systems. This results in 211 total small firms.18 Using the same 85% capture rate assumption, this yields a total of 248 small wind firms. With a mean wind employment of 13.71 workers19 in the small universe, it is estimated that the small-wind universe employs 3,397 wind workers. These 3,397 workers, when added to the 65,729 workers in the large firm universe, equals 69,126 wind workers in the 15 selected wind industry categories. 

17 A further assumption is made that the 15% of firms not in the database have a similar profile (mean) to the 85% of firms included in the database. 18 Due to decimal rounding. 19 This assumes that the firms that screened out of the large sample have a similar profile (mean) to the pre- identified firms in the small universe sample.\n\n---\n\n### Page 41\n\n35 This report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications.

This is the first attempt to understand the full breadth of the wind workforce in a systematic fashion. Your help in this project is the best way that we can arrive at a meaningful understanding of the workforce needs of this industry. Your individual responses will not be published; only aggregated information will be used in reporting the survey results. The survey should take approximately 15 minutes of your time. By answering this survey, you can help inform how investments of time and money should be made to support the industry and how to prepare the present and future wind energy labor pool based on your needs. The survey is being hosted by BW Research for NREL. [Show NREL Logo on Intro Page] Screener Questions A.
