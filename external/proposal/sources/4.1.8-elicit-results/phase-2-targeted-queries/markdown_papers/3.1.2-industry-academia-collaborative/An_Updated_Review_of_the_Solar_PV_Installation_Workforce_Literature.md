National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Golden, CO (United States) + Show Author Affiliations In order to develop a well-trained, equitable, and inclusive workforce with high quality jobs, the DOE Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) identified a need for analytical context around different PV project characteristics and labor aspects, and how they might impact workforce wellbeing and PV industry growth. To determine the most valuable novel analytical contributions, this work reviews existing literature on solar workforce topics to identify what areas have been studied previously and where gaps remain. Focus areas included the following topics: (1) metrics for solar workforce, deployment, costs, and associated studies capturing aspects such as demographics and regional distribution, (2) solar workforce wellbeing, including employee contracting mechanisms, compensation, occupational safety and health, and community impacts, (3) national and state policies most relevant to the U.S. solar workforce, and (4) ongoing efforts to expand solar workforce participation, including local staffing dynamics, challenges, and relevant strategies.
