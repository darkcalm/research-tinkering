Executive Summary 
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Building Technologies Office (BTO) envisions a future 
where the U.S. building industry leads globally in delivering quality efficiency products and 
services to American consumers and businesses. One barrier to achieving this vision is the 
difficulty reported by energy efficiency employers in finding qualified candidates (NASEO and 
EFI 2020). However, this barrier also presents an opportunity for the industry to expand in a way 
that invites and supports a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive workforce. The scope of 
energy, climate, and technology challenges the country faces will require the talents of all 
Americans. The purpose of this study therefore is to identify key factors to creating successful 
workforce development and inclusion programs that will support the future of the building 
industry. These factors can be applied to individual companies, training programs, or broader 
industry efforts. 
This study first reviews what is meant by the terms equity, inclusion, and belonging, and the 
importance of addressing all these elements in any workforce programming. To achieve true 
equity and inclusion, standard recruitment and retention practices require complementary 
approaches addressing differences in communication methods, mentoring and networking 
access, career pathways, and wrap-around or non-technical services. It is also important to 
establish diversity, equity, and inclusion baselines, set measurable goals, track progress, and 
adjust as needed to ensure that programs are responding appropriately to worker needs. 
The study then shifts to methods for cultivating the future workforce by effectively engaging 
with students and young professionals. The construction sector, a vital part of the building 
industry, has had difficulty appealing to students, in part due to a negative perception of careers 
in the field. This report describes how the building industry can help shift this perception if it can 
appeal to millennial and Generation Z desire for purpose in their careers, connection to lifestyle 
values, and application of technology in the workplace. In addition, the industry needs to better 
illustrate to parents, students, teachers, and counselors the different pathways into and through 
the building industry, all of which can lead to a stable, well-paying career. 
Included in this study are many examples of programs seeing success in workforce engagement 
and inclusion. These case studies show how equitable and inclusive workforce development 
activities can broaden the applicant pool by attracting more students and historically 
underrepresented groups to building industry careers. Taken together, these activities will 
prepare the U.S. workforce to meet the needs of the future built environment, and reduce energy 
use across the economy.

1 Introduction and Background 
The Biden Administration has set priorities for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to focus 
its work: combating climate change, creating clean energy union jobs, promoting equity and 
diversity in STEM within clean energy industries, and promoting energy justice. Embedded in 
these priorities is an acknowledgement that communities of color and low-income communities 
have borne the brunt of air, water, and soil pollution, and that the clean energy revolution must 
lift the communities that have been left behind and make sure those who have suffered the most 
are the first to benefit. This has included launching the Justice40 Initiative, which is a plan to 
deliver 40% of the overall benefits of climate investments to disadvantaged communities and 
inform equitable research, development, and deployment within DOE (DOE 2022). 
In support of these goals, DOE’s Building Technologies Office (BTO) and the National 
Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) recognize that a large and diverse workforce is necessary 
for achieving the mission to make the United States a global leader in delivering quality energy 
efficiency and clean energy products to American homes and buildings. BTO focuses its 
workforce development efforts on students and professionals who are vital for designing, 
constructing, installing, and operating energy-efficient buildings and technologies. This national 
effort is aimed at creating the jobs needed to build a modern, sustainable infrastructure and to 
deliver an equitable clean energy future, support workers affected by the energy transition, and 
ensure no communities are left behind. 
The purpose of this study is to identify key factors to create successful workforce recruitment 
and retention programs that help increase diversity and equity within the building energy 
efficiency industry. These factors can be applied to individual companies, training programs, or 
broader industry efforts. 
Today, the existing energy efficiency workforce does not fully represent the diversity of the 
United States. DOE, the National Association of State Energy Officials (NASEO), and the 
Energy Futures Initiative (EFI) have been publishing data on the energy efficiency workforce 
since 2016 in the U.S. Energy and Employment Report (USEER). According to the USEER, after 
several years of job growth, energy efficiency employment1 contracted by more than 11% in 
2020 to 2.1 million workers across a range of professions in construction, manufacturing, 
wholesale trade, professional, and other services. This was almost entirely a result of COVID-19 
challenges, and employers were also optimistic that these losses would be largely erased in 2021 
(NASEO and EFI 2021). These job losses disproportionately impacted Hispanic and Latino 
workers (E2 et al. 2020). 
Exacerbating the workforce shortage is hiring difficulty experienced by a large majority of 
energy efficiency employers. The 2021 USEER found that a majority of energy efficiency 
employers had difficulty finding qualified candidates because of a lack of technical skills, small 
 
1 The energy efficiency workforce is defined as “employment [that] covers both the production and installation of 
energy-saving products and the provision of services that reduce end-use energy consumption” (NASEO and EFI 
2021). The USEER energy efficiency employment figure does not include direct employees of utility companies 
who supervise, design, or implement utility energy efficiency programs. These workers are counted as utility 
employees in the 2021 USEER.

applicant pool, and lack of industry-specific knowledge (NASEO and EFI 2021). Industry and 
organizational workforce development activities can help address these areas by designing 
opportunities that broaden the applicant pool by attracting more students and historically 
underrepresented groups to building efficiency careers, and linking them to resources to improve 
their skills and industry knowledge. 
The scope of energy, climate, and technology challenges the country faces will require the talents 
of all Americans, including those who have been underrepresented or disproportionately 
impacted by COVID-19. Employing strategies to attract a diverse workforce is especially 
important in sectors that are positioned to have a dramatic shift in the use of technology or that 
otherwise face a significant transition because diverse perspectives provide the benefit of 
challenging conventional thinking and developing innovative approaches. Many new 
technologies, program designs, and business models are poised to re-innovate the efficiency 
sector, including robots that perform high-risk or repetitive tasks on construction sites, digital 
building twins to aid in building design, and augmented and virtual reality to streamline project 
planning (Deloitte 2020). 
Studies have found that a more diverse workforce also delivers measurable benefits. The body of 
evidence supporting the correlation between the diversity of a company’s workforce and its 
financial performance is well established. Mc Kinsey and Company’s 2015 “Diversity Matters” 
report found a statistically significant correlation between gender and ethnic diversity and 
company performance. Mc Kinsey identifies the most important drivers as (1) advantages in 
recruiting the best talent, (2) stronger customer orientation, (3) increased employee satisfaction, 
and (4) improved decision-making (Hunt et al. 2015). Likewise, the report notes that companies 
in the top quartile for women leaders are 15% more likely to have above average financial 
returns. This correlation suggests that companies/industries are more successful when they are 
committed to diverse leadership. Gender diversity in the energy sector workforce is essential to 
promote more innovative and inclusive solutions that can help make clean energy accessible to 
the entire population (IEA 2020). 
Additionally, racial and ethnic minorities are expected to make up more than half of the U.S. 
population by midcentury, with millennials and Generation Z2 accounting for 44% and 48% of 
this population, respectively (Frey 2018). The development of strategies that attract top talent 
from diverse gender and ethnic groups will necessitate an emphasis on equity, inclusion, and 
belonging as the demographics of the workforce shift. Redefining what “the best and the 
brightest” means via a diversity and inclusionary lens is necessary to create a company culture 
accepting of innovative solutions from diverse perspectives. The addition of gender diversity, 
racial and ethnic minorities, millennials, and Generation Z within the demographics of the 
building efficiency workforce helps ensure that the best and the brightest employees are hired, 
thereby strengthening American innovation and competitiveness in the sector for decades to 
come. Steps taken now to increase the diversity of the efficiency workforce and provide good

wages, benefits, and worker protections will ensure that companies cultivate loyal employees and 
have a strong financial foundation. 
Many businesses, nonprofits, training organizations, labor organizations, and government 
agencies have been working to address diversity and equity gaps in the workforce. This paper 
identifies many examples—but is by no means exhaustive—to help contribute to our collective 
understanding and support replication of successful models. 
1.1 Scope and Definitions 
This study reviews programs, processes, and general approaches to workforce development that 
create equitable and inclusive work environments, and successfully attract and retain workers in 
the building and energy efficiency industries. For the purposes of this report, the National 
Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) defines “building energy efficiency careers” as those 
careers critical to the expansion of high-performance buildings, including research and 
manufacturing, architecture, construction and engineering, facilities management, energy ratings, 
and real estate professionals. Energy efficiency and building energy efficiency are used 
interchangeably throughout this report. 
1.2 Report Organization 
This paper begins with a brief overview of diversity statistics for the energy efficiency workforce 
and workforce diversity programs, discusses student interest in these careers, and concludes with 
a discussion of workforce diversity best practices. Additional workforce programs reviewed for 
this study are described in Appendix A. 
1.3 Limitations 
Defining and tracking the building efficiency workforce is challenging because energy efficiency 
is often part, but not all, of a person’s job. This study is therefore structurally limited by the lack 
of data available to measure the energy efficiency workforce. In fact, there are no NAICS codes 
in the U.S. Department of Labor’s industry classification system to identify efficiency careers; 
thus, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) does not track or report on the workforce in the 
efficient building technologies sector. To fill this void, the Office of Energy Efficiency and 
Renewable Energy within DOE commissioned the first USEER, published in 2016. USEER 
provides year-over-year statistics on “energy efficiency” careers. Diversity data measured in the 
2021 USEER and BLS include gender, age, race/ethnicity, and veteran status. 
While the USEER provides some insight into the state of diversity within the energy efficiency 
sector, many elements were not measured in this survey, including socioeconomic factors, or 
participation by the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) community or 
other groups, such as formerly incarcerated individuals. Because more than half of those 
considered to be “energy efficiency employees” in the USEER work in the construction industry, 
diversity data from the broader construction industry are used to fill in some of the data gaps in 
the first section. 
Currently available data on diversity in the efficiency workforce do not provide a comprehensive 
or granular enough view to fully understand diversity within the building efficiency sector. For 
instance, data are lacking on wage rates or occupations within the energy efficiency sector for

various demographic groups. Additional data gathering techniques that allow for greater 
segmentation and cross analysis will help us better understand the state of diversity within this 
workforce. 
2 Diversity Within the Efficiency Workforce 
Demographics measured in the USEER show that women and Black or African American 
workers are notably underrepresented in the building energy efficiency sector when compared 
with their representation in the national workforce averages (NASEO and EFI 2021). 
Table 1. Energy Efficiency Workforce Demographics (Q4, 2020) 
Source: 2021 USEER 
 
Beyond this imbalance in the energy efficiency sector broadly, the demographics can be even 
more divergent for specific careers within the workforce. For example, although women account 
for 48% of the total U.S. workforce, they make up less than 2% of the heating, ventilating, and 
air-conditioning (HVAC) workforce (Electric & Gas Industries Association 2018). 
A review of 2020 BLS data, illustrated in Figure 1, shows that key professions in the building 
energy efficiency industry, namely architecture, engineering, and construction, are 
predominately white men. For comparison, while managers in energy efficiency fields follow 
this trend, management professionals overall have an almost balanced gender split and 
approximately double the minority representation, consistent with their representation in the 
working-age population overall (BLS 2020).

Figure 1. Demographics of key energy efficiency professions by job type 
Source: Data from BLS 2020 
According to Mc Kinsey & Company, “The construction industry historically has a poor record 
of achieving gender parity in its workforce. The shift from manual labor, which is typically 
male-dominated, to new technology-enabled ways of working could mean increased interest 
from women. Construction needs to diversify its sources of talent to attract the best people, and 
higher female participation is a large opportunity” (Barbosa et al. 2017).

Figure 2. Equality versus equity illustrative cartoon 
Source: Interaction Institute for Social Change. Artist: Angus Maguire. 
According to the Interaction Institute for Social Change, equity (e.g., seeing the game in Figure 
2) is not achieved by simply giving each individual an equal block to stand on. Similarly, 
workplaces cannot achieve equity without considering what each population (e.g., minority, 
majority, and underserved) may need to be successful in the workplace. The concept of inclusion 
takes this a step farther, actively cultivating an environment that promotes direct participation 
and a sense of belonging. Understanding the range of different populations’ needs and providing 
services that support their success is essential for creating an equitable and inclusive workforce. 
Unlike the people in the cartoon, who are “unequal” because of an intrinsic personal feature 
(their height), workplace inequity is often a condition resulting from many years of unconscious 
bias3 imposed on historically disadvantaged groups. Addressing unconscious bias requires a 
holistic approach within a workplace and cannot be overcome by simply offering diversity 
training. A review of organizational practices surrounding recruitment, hiring, employee 
development, company culture, promotions, and retention are needed to address biases among 
employees, managers, and organizational systems. The first step in addressing workforce 
diversity leading to equitable inclusion is to work with your Human Resources department to 
analyze underrepresentation. 
 
3 The Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity defines unconscious bias as attitudes or stereotypes that 
impact our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner such that self-reflection does not reveal 
them.

Designing successful workforce diversity programs requires a holistic approach that includes 
both employees and employers. The many programs reviewed for this paper, described in 
Section 2.2 and Appendix A, have uncovered common practices for designing and implementing 
successful workforce inclusion programs. 
2.2 Workforce Development Programs for Underrepresented Groups 
The following workforce programs illustrate many of the key factors for success described in 
Section 2.3 of this paper. The highlighted programs are not an exhaustive list of available 
programs but represent a subset of the workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion programs 
studied for this paper. Additional programs reviewed are included in Appendix A. 
Community Hub for Opportunities in Construction Employment 
In March 2019, North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) partnered with the 
Community Hub for Opportunities in Construction Employment and the Baltimore Black 
Worker Union Center to produce an event titled, “From Girls in the Hood to Women in 
Construction.” Approximately 50 attendees were encouraged to consider careers in the 
construction trades by attending panel sessions with Black women with careers in the 
construction industry, meeting with recruiters, and networking with the local trade union. The 
Community Hub for Opportunities in Construction Employment is an initiative launched by the 
Clinton Global Foundation with NABTU in 2014. It included a five-year commitment by 
NABTU to increase diversity within the construction trades. 
Environmental Leadership Program Roger Arliner Young Diversity Fellowship 
Program 
The Environmental Leadership Program (ELP) runs the Roger Arliner Young Diversity 
Fellowship Program to address the challenges of college graduates from diverse backgrounds 
gaining employment in the clean energy field (Environmental Leadership Program n.d.). The 
Diversity Fellowship Program offers a two-year paid fellowship for recent college graduates 
from diverse backgrounds to work with clean energy nonprofit organizations. ELP recruits 
employers and assists them in developing inclusive job descriptions and screening fellowship 
applicants. ELP works with employers prior to hiring fellows to address issues that employees 
may face, including microaggressions, imposter syndrome, and unconscious bias. ELP helps 
employers create safe spaces to address these diversity and inclusion issues within the 
organization. All fellows are employed in full-time, living-wage positions with benefits (paid for 
by the employer) and receive a $1,000 stipend for professional development (paid for by ELP). 
ELP also provides monthly coaching and access to ELP’s mentorship network. A typical cohort 
consists of 10–12 fellows. A major barrier preventing the program from expanding is the time 
and effort required to develop relationships with employers willing and able to participate in the 
program (King 2020). 
Kentucky Housing Corporation 
As part of the federal Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP), local agencies (subgrantees) 
are required to have all weatherized homes inspected by a quality control inspector (QCI) 
certified by the Building Performance Institute. In late 2017, Kentucky had 23 subgrantees 
implementing WAP, 7 of which did not have a QCI on staff, with a single QCI contractor 
attempting to serve 6 of those agencies. QCI certification requires energy auditor certification, in

addition to taking QCI training and passing a test. The Kentucky Housing Corporation (KHC), 
which manages WAP at the state level, received feedback from multiple interested individuals 
who reported barriers to participation in training, which included the cost of the training, lost 
wages during the 11 weeks of training, and costs of travel to attend the training. To address the 
shortage of QCIs and anticipated retirements from existing QCIs, KHC aimed to recruit, train, 
and upskill new QCIs from outside the WAP network. KHC secured a $49,000 grant from the 
Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet to support the training of four new QCIs. To address 
the identified barriers, KHC covered the cost of training, provided a $15 per hour stipend for 
each week spent in training, and covered the cost of travel for students within 50 miles of the 
training site or the cost of lodging and per diem for students more than 50 miles from the training 
site (Mc Cord 2020). Additionally, if an employer was willing to commit to employing a new 
QCI to work on WAP jobs for two years, KHC paid the stipend to the employer to offset the cost 
of keeping employees fully employed during the training. The QCI training was scheduled to be 
completed in spring 2020, but the pandemic delayed the final week of training and subsequent 
testing. 
Massachusetts Clean Energy Center Clean Energy Internship Program 
The Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (Mass CEC) Clean Energy Internship Program is a 
utility-rate-payer-funded program that addresses the challenges faced by students who cannot 
afford to take unpaid internships. Mass CEC is not involved in the selection of interns, but rather 
facilitates the connection between prospective interns and employers and reimburses the host 
company up to $7,600 per student (Massachusetts Clean Energy Center 2020a). 
After the program was first launched in 2011, Mass CEC recognized that the majority of the 
initial cohorts were largely white males from private universities and therefore took a twopronged approach to increase the diversity of the program (Jacques 2020). First, they increased 
the number of interns a company could hire through the program from two to three, if the third 
student came from a community college. Second, Mass CEC targeted recruitment efforts at public 
schools and community colleges. These efforts have proven effective, with 42% of the current 
cohort of interns composed of women or minority students. Since its inception, the program has 
placed over 3,600 interns at nearly 470 companies, with 784 interns receiving offers for full-time 
or part-time employment at their host company following the internship (Massachusetts Clean 
Energy Center 2020a). 
Building on the success of the Clean Energy Internship Program, Mass CEC also launched the 
Vocational Internship Program to help place students (rising juniors and seniors) from vocational 
high schools in paid clean energy internships during the academic year (Massachusetts Clean 
Energy Center 2020b). 
New York State Energy Research and Development Authority On-the-Job Training 
for Energy Efficiency and Clean Technology

On-the-Job Training (OJT) for Energy Efficiency and Clean Technology program provides wage 
subsidies to eligible businesses to help reduce the financial risk of hiring and training new 
workers (NYSERDA 2020). In partnership with the New York State Department of Labor, the 
program pays employers half of the wages for a new hire up to $16 per hour, with a cap of

$100,000 per employer. The wage payment is for four months for new hires who are not 
included in NYSERDA’s priority populations, and for six months if the new hire is from one of 
the following priority populations: veterans, Native Americans, individuals with disabilities, 
low-income individuals, unemployed power plant workers, previously incarcerated individuals, 
youth participating in designated work preparedness programs, and residents in designated 
environmental justice communities. The New York State Department of Labor assists 
participating businesses in developing OJT training plans and in assessing skills necessary for a 
position and identifying potential interviewees. As of May 2020, approximately 26% of the new 
hires in the OJT program were from these priority populations, and since the beginning of 2019, 
approximately 80% of all new hires were retained by employers following the wage subsidy 
period (Ferranti 2020). By lowering the financial risk to train new employees, the OJT program 
creates an additional incentive for employers to diversify their hiring and provide opportunity for 
nontraditional workers. 
The Build Out Alliance Promotes Equity in the Workplace for LGBTQ 
Professionals in the Building Design and Construction Industries 
The Build Out Alliance is a nonprofit organization with a mission to promote and advocate for 
LGBTQ people working openly in the building design and construction industry and strives to 
make the industry more welcoming to LGBTQ professionals. The organization certifies 
corporations that have taken steps to be inclusive of the LGBTQ community. The Build Out 
Alliance has certified 1,428 businesses, has 260 corporate partners, and 60 chapters nationwide 
as of June 2020. 
50K Coalition Focuses on Graduating 50,000 Diverse Engineering Students Yearly 
In 2015, the American Indian Science & Engineering Society (AISES), the National Society of 
Black Engineers (NSBE), the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), and the 
Society of Women Engineers (SWE) formed a coalition to focus on producing 50,000 
engineering graduates from underrepresented groups annually by 2025. The 50K Coalition 
includes 40 partners in 2020 using the Collective Impact framework to drive collective action to 
achieve the national goal. The comprehensive strategy includes common agenda strategies, 
shared metrics and measurement, continuous communication strategies, and backbone support 
and governance strategies. 
2.3 Key Success Factors for Workforce Diversity, Equity, and 
Inclusion Programs 
The workforce programs described in Section 2.2 show various approaches for addressing 
underrepresentation in a range of buildings-related industries. Common elements are outlined in 
Table 2 and discussed in subsequent sections. In particular, establishing a diversity, equity, and 
inclusion baseline and setting a measurable goal, designing a program for success, tracking 
progress, and adjusting where needed will increase the likelihood of achieving an organization’s 
workforce inclusion goals.

2.3.1 Organizational/Industry Assessment 
Successful workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion programs start with an assessment of 
existing demographics within an industry or organization. The steps shown in Table 2 can be 
applied at the organizational level or to an industry overall. Once existing demographics are 
known, an organization/industry can assess whether aspects of policy or process are creating

barriers to a more inclusive environment. Reviewing organizational or industry recruiting, hiring, 
promotion, and retention practices are a vital step for identifying where bias may exist within the 
system. Consider recruitment efforts, interview questions, promotion criteria, partnering 
practices, and retention strategies to determine whether they are equitable for underrepresented 
groups. Likewise, a transparent review regarding whether the organization’s culture is accepting 
of diverse approaches from underrepresented groups is vital prior to recruitment to ensure high 
retention rates. Finally, establishing goals for workplace diversity, equity, and inclusion will help 
align an organization or industry to take actions that result in a more diverse and inclusive 
workforce. 
It should also be noted that individual companies or organizations can be supported by 
community organizations supporting underrepresented populations. For example, nearly all the 
programs summarized in Section 2.2 and the Appendix developed relationships with employers 
to solicit guidance on needed workforce skills and worked with their jobseekers to develop indemand skills. By serving as a bridge between jobseekers and employers, community-based 
organizations can help companies facilitate intended employment outcomes. 
2.3.2 Program Design and Implementation 
Community organizations can also help employers understand the cultural aspects of integrating 
underrepresented employees into their workforce, thereby guiding the design and 
implementation of effective diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. Working with various 
underrepresented populations may require different yet fluid approaches to recruitment and 
retention based on economic status, cultural values, or prior experience. Understanding barriers 
to entry for diverse gender and racial groups allows programs to be intentionally designed to 
support a specific underrepresented population. 
Common Elements in Workforce Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Programs Include: 
• Initial Communication. Different avenues of communication should be explored when 
approaching underrepresented populations. It is important to develop a personal connection 
with diverse populations to ensure successful engagement. For example, just emailing and 
assuming the recipient received the information is not sufficient. 
• Wrap-Around Services. Many of the organizations highlighted in this report (Section 2.2 and 
Appendix A) emphasized the need to have “wrap-around” support for participants. These 
services may include financial assistance for attending pre-employment training, such as 
subsidizing the cost of training, providing a stipend for lost income during training, and 
assisting with transportation and childcare. Wrap-around services can lower the barriers to 
entry that some underrepresented groups face to participating in energy efficiency careers. 
• 
Nontechnical Support. Many of the programs provide resume development and interview 
preparation services. Some programs offer support such as instruction in financial literacy, 
writing, and cross-cultural interactions. For example, a virtual boot camp with these elements 
could develop pre-employment skills to help underrepresented groups become more 
competitive applicants. 
• Mentorship and Networking. Several programs reported that providing participants with 
opportunities to learn from experienced individuals from similar diverse backgrounds was 
critical to participant engagement and retention in the programs. Additionally, peer cohorts

and alumni networks were cited as useful features for dealing with workplace cultural 
dynamics and navigating the energy efficiency industry. 
• Employer Support: Understanding the employment opportunities for participants in 
workforce development programs for underrepresented groups is an important element for 
their success. This analysis can help programs ensure that sufficient employment or contract 
opportunities are available once participants complete a program and determine whether 
employers need additional educational or financial support to successfully employ and retain 
employees who participate in these programs. 
• Career Pathways. Lasting workforce development efforts expand the career pathways for 
new employees and avoid limiting entry-level professionals to low-skill positions. Exposing 
new energy efficiency professionals to a range of technologies, job roles, and industry 
players through on-the-job and apprenticeship-based training, along with nontechnical 
support, can support career mobility for entry-level workers. Internships through 2- and 4year education institutions can also expose students to entry-level positions. Many workforce 
development programs build employer relationships and serve as a bridge between job 
seekers and employers. 
2.3.3 Program Evaluation 
Grounding workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in data allows organizations to 
track progress toward specific goals and adjust or wind down programs as appropriate. Examples 
of metrics include matching the racial/ethnic, gender, and socioeconomic demographics of a 
local area, measuring progress against an industry or organizational baseline, tracking retention, 
and tracking upward mobility of underrepresented groups compared with the majority 
population. Assessing the number of inclusion activities such as employee resource groups, 
surveys to staff, and seminars and activities that celebrate diverse backgrounds can indicate the 
level of inclusivity in an organization. 
Intel Corporation is best-in-class in terms of transparency regarding its workforce demographics. 
The corporation measures race and gender (options include male, female, and unknown) for all 
employees from entry level to senior leadership and tracks retention rates and upward mobility of 
underrepresented groups. Figure 3 shows Intel’s diversity metrics measured between 2014 and 
2016 to show year-over-year progress. Underrepresented gender and racial groups such as 
women, Asian, Hispanic/Latino, and Black/African American employees saw an increase in 
senior hires (green) from 2015 to 2016. Intel’s transparency regarding workforce demographics 
demonstrated positive contributions toward a more equitable workforce for all.

Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate the transparency of some of the national laboratories regarding their 
workplace demographics for NREL and Sandia, respectively. For example, despite the low 
percentage numbers within different racial groups, the transparency of both examples in 
representing all groups within their workforce rather than displaying only the underrepresented 
minorities helps to illustrate their diversity and inclusion goals to future professionals. Sandia 
National Laboratories further expresses their transparency by showing the matriculation of 
women and different racial populations into various positions within their company (Figure 5).

3 Student Engagement 
Attracting students to efficiency careers is an important element of increasing workforce 
diversity within the sector. Racial and ethnic minorities are expected to make up more than half 
of the U.S. population by midcentury, with millennials and Generation Z4 accounting for 44% 
and 48% of the population, respectively (Frey 2018). Employers must understand the context in 
which the younger generations want to live and work in order to attract young people to building 
efficiency careers. It is important to attract students early on, from K-12 through post-secondary 
educational institutions. 
3.1 Shifting Preferences and Values 
In addition to being more racially and ethnically diverse, millennials and Generation Z tend to be 
more environmentally conscious and technology savvy than preceding generations. Like 
generations before, they value money to provide for their basic needs, but want to find meaning 
and purpose in a career (Gallup 2019) and expect a diverse and inclusive workplace (O’Boyle 
2021). The following sections describe the preferences of Generation Z and millennials 
regarding technology, sustainability, and careers. 
Technology. The use of technology is important to the younger generations. A Pw C study 
published in 2012 about the future workplace states “Millennials will expect a workplace 
technology ecosystem that includes social networking, instant messaging, video-on-demand, 
blogs and wikis. These social tools will enable this generation to instantly connect, engage, and 
collaborate with cohorts and managers in ways that are natural to them, leading to better 
productivity across the enterprise” (Pw C 2012). Similarly, a survey of more than 12,000 
Generation Z students between the ages of 16 and 23 found that 91% of respondents indicated 
that technology would influence their job choice among similar employment offers (Dell 2019). 
As digital natives, millennials and Generation Z will view a workplace without digital 
technology as outdated and unappealing. 
Sustainability. Millennials and Generation Z tend to be more health conscious and 
environmentally aware than the older generations. In addition, the younger generations are more 
likely to believe that humans are causing climate change (Figure 6) (Parker, Graf, and Igielnik 
2019). Numerous surveys also show that both generations value meaning and purpose in their 
careers. A Dell Technologies survey found that 43% of Generation Z agree that “work has 
meaning and purpose beyond getting paid” (Dell 2019). Therefore, millennials and Generation Z 
are more likely to want to have an impact on the state of climate change and may be interested in 
careers in clean energy sectors. 
 
4 Generation Z includes people born after 1995, millennials were born between 1980 and 1995, according to 
https://www.kasasa.com/articles/generations/gen-x-gen-y-gen-z.

Figure 6. Views on climate change and its causes across generations 
Source: Pew Research Center 2019 
When considering these values, it is reasonable to conclude that the younger generations are 
more likely to support sustainability in all aspects of their lives and work. Evidence of this is 
presented in a 2019 article published by Constructor Magazine that states, “Generation Z will be 
motivated about features such as lighting controls and window coverings that automatically 
adjust with the sun’s position; HVAC systems whose fans operate only when motion is detected; 
and plumbing systems that optimize water flow based on usage. Those amenities will no longer 
be a value-add for residents—they will be expected.” 
Career Preferences. While millennials have been known to change jobs frequently, fueling the 
success of the gig economy (Adkins 2016), Generation Z tends to be more risk averse when it 
comes to choosing a career path. A 2019 Newsweek article reported that among University of 
Georgia students, the most desirable trait in a future employer was job stability, followed by 
professional development and work-life balance. The article suggests that Generation Z students 
about to enter the workforce were children during the 2008 recession and experienced or 
witnessed parents losing jobs and savings (Piore 2019). During a global pandemic, job security is 
likely a very desirable trait that a future employer can showcase as Generation Z is newly 
entering the workforce. When faced with choosing a particular industry in energy, Generation Z 
is more interested in careers in renewable energy than in traditional oil and gas industries, as 
shown in Figure 7 (Morning Consult 2020). However, the survey did not ask Generation Z 
respondents about their interest in a career in energy efficiency.

3.2 Shifting the Negative Perception of Construction Careers 
The construction industry, a vital part of the building energy efficiency sector, has had difficulty 
appealing to students, in part due to a negative perception of careers in the field. Mc Kinsey & 
Company’s Reinventing Construction report (2017) states that, “the [construction] industry has 
an image of being dull among the latest generation of top-talent engineers and interdisciplinary 
managers who can run projects of substantial complexity.” Another study found that 71% of 
students surveyed describe themselves either “definitely not” or “probably not” interested in 
pursuing a career in HVAC, although a majority of parents state that they would likely be 
supportive of HVAC as a career choice for their children (Figure 8) (Electric & Gas Industries 
Association).

Figure 8. Survey responses regarding HVAC career perceptions 
Source: Electric & Gas Industries Association 2018 
Employers in the building energy efficiency sector must overcome the negative perception that 
students, from K-12 through college, have of the construction trades in order to attract top talent. 
The research and programs provided in the following two sections offer examples of how this 
could be achieved. 
The agriculture industry, which has faced similar perception challenges, has been successful in 
attracting new and younger farmers to the sustainable agriculture industry in recent years. 
According to the Ag America Lending, millennial farmers now make up 8% of U.S. farmers. In 
addition, new entrants to agriculture, or “beginning farmers” with 10 years or less in the industry, 
made up one-fifth of all U.S. farmers in 2018 (Cubbage 2019). 
A career in sustainable agriculture may be appealing to younger generations for a variety of 
reasons. It offers purpose and impact beyond oneself and connects to millennial values for 
healthy and sustainable living. Furthermore, the agriculture industry is embracing technology for 
numerous applications, from the use of drones for aerial imagery to robotic milking technologies 
that increase the productivity of farms and the quality of goods. 
The building efficiency industry is poised to experience a similar shift in perception if it can also 
appeal to millennial and Generation Z’s desire for purpose in their careers, connection to lifestyle 
values, and application of technology in the workplace. In addition, it may be seen as a more 
stable industry than it has been in the past because it remained one of the essential industries 
allowed to continue operations during the COVID-19 pandemic, even if the construction industry 
suffered record job losses (Lawrence 2020).

3.3 Student Engagement Programs and Approaches 
The following student engagement programs include many of the key success factors listed in 
Section 3.1. The highlighted programs are a subset of the workforce diversity programs studied 
for this paper. Additional programs reviewed are included in Appendix A. 
Agriculture in the Classroom 
Agriculture in the Classroom is a long-standing program funded by the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture to encourage teachers to educate students about the role agriculture plays in our 
economy and society. The effort includes an online database that lists hundreds of pre-K through 
12th grade educational materials about agriculture. 
Joint Science and Technology Institute 
The Joint Science and Technology Institute, provided through the Oak Ridge Institute for 
Science and Education, is a fully funded, two-week residential program for middle and high 
school students and teachers that includes hands-on experiments with U.S. Department of 
Defense (Do D) researchers in Do D schools around the world. The purpose of the program is to 
expose students and teachers to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers and 
increase STEM competencies. In 2019, the program educated 35 high school students, 32 middle 
school students, and 8 teachers from the United States, Germany, and South Korea. 
Mead Energy Academy 
The Mead Energy Academy in Longmont, Colorado, is a program that allows high school 
students to focus on energy-related topics while earning their high school diploma. The academy 
serves students whose career interests are related to the energy field (such as engineering or 
welding) and those interested in fields that support the energy industry (such as law or 
marketing). The academy is open to all students and prepares them for careers in the energy 
field, whether they plan to attend a trade school, earn a four-year college degree, or immediately 
join the workforce. Cross-curricular courses in math, science, social studies, language arts, 
business, and more are taught with an energy focus. 
Frankford High School Bright Solar Futures Academy 
Frankford High School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, serves a student body with 91% racial 
minorities, where 99% of students are eligible for free lunch (Frankford High School 2020). In 
2018, Frankford High School established the Bright Solar Futures Academy, which is a first-inthe nation high school career and technical education solar program (Frankford High School 
2020). In addition to training students in solar installation, the three-year curriculum for high 
school students also covers energy efficiency technologies, electricity, and construction basics. 
The program includes hands-on experience with equipment and paid summer internships in the 
new Frankford Solar Laboratory. The program was in part funded by a $1.25 million grant from 
the U.S. Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office, as well as from PECO, the 
local utility, which contributed funding for the construction of the new solar laboratory at 
Frankford High School (Philadelphia Energy Authority n.d.). The project team developed a list 
of solar competencies needed for graduation, approved by a local solar industry occupational 
advisory committee. Although initially envisioned to focus on solar technologies, the program 
has expanded to include energy efficiency, which provides additional career pathways beyond 
solar installation. The program was motivated in part to develop the workforce to meet the

demand for solar driven by a local city rebate and the Solarize Philly effort (Philadelphia Sun 
2019). 
Build Your Future 
Build Your Future aims to catalyze recruiting the next generation of craft professionals. One of 
their signature programs, Power UP Loud, is aimed at getting young women interested in 
construction careers using game-like technology. In addition to traditional training, participants 
experience the construction industry via simulators and virtual reality headsets that mimic some 
of today’s most popular video games. 
Block Kids Building Competition 
The Block Kids Building Competition is a national competition sponsored at the local level by 
National Association of Women in Construction chapters and other organizations. 
The competition, open to elementary children in grades K–6, introduces children to the 
construction industry to help create awareness and promote careers in the industry. The 
competition involves the construction of various structures with interlocking blocks and three of 
the following additional items: a small rock, string, foil, and poster board. 
Minecraft Lesson Plans for Teachers 
Minecraft Lesson Plans for Teachers, developed by Mojang Studios and Xbox Game Studios, is 
an educational program for teaching a range of topics through Minecraft, including science and 
math, along with a database of 500 lesson plans focused on renewable energy and 
resourcefulness in STEM curricula. Developed by Disco Learning Media, these lesson plans are 
aligned with state educational standards in multiple states and help teachers build challenges for 
students to complete. Educators can adapt and edit lessons after the first year of experience with 
Minecraft Education Edition, providing the opportunity to deepen the lessons and refine their 
students’ learning experience. 
Tech Kids Unlimited 
Tech Kids Unlimited is a not-for-profit educational organization focused on kids with special 
needs. The organization teaches project-based workshops on coding, game design, video editing, 
animation, and 3D printing. The programming for teens includes introductory coding and 
computer skills. An independent evaluation showed advancements in technology and work-based 
skills as well as in social/emotional learning. Tech Kids Unlimited reports that positive results 
were most pronounced in improved self-esteem, self-advocacy, technology skills, and digital 
literacy. Parents and counselors reported that 77% of youth participants indicated significant 
gains in technology skills after one week, and 73% of parents believed their child gained skills to 
help secure future employment. 
3.4 Key Success Factors in Student Engagement Programs 
Attracting more students to building energy efficiency careers can be achieved by cultivating 
interest while children are in primary and secondary school and exposing them to the variety of 
pathways into and through the industry. While there is no prescriptive path for how one might 
enter the energy efficiency workforce, there are distinct educational pathways and requirements 
for different professions within the building energy efficiency sector, shown in Table 3.

Understanding that any pathway into the building efficiency sector can lead to a stable, wellpaying career is vital for parents, students, teachers, and counselors. The National Association of 
Homebuilders reported that median wages in construction grew more than national median 
wages in 2018 (3.2% versus 2.5%, respectively), with even larger increases for specific laborers 
and helpers, ranging from 6.7% for roofing helpers to 3.6% for construction laborers (NAHB 
2018). In addition, the Bureau of Labor Statistics expects construction jobs to continue to grow 
0.4% annually from 2019 to 2029, although at a slower rate than the pre-pandemic 10-year 
forecast of 1.1% annual growth (BLS 2018, 2019). 
Many of the careers shown in Table 3 require a strong foundation in STEM subjects and pay 
higher than average wages, according to a Pew Research study conducted in 2017 (Kennedy, 
Hefferon, and Funk 2018). However, even with the promise of higher wages, many students are 
not pursuing STEM degrees. The 2017 study indicates that students believe that STEM subjects 
are not useful for their careers (23%), or they think these subjects are too boring (12%) to pursue 
as a course of study (Kennedy, Hefferon, and Funk 2018). 
Some parents augment their children’s in-school exposure to STEM by engaging in after-school 
programs. Outside the classroom, STEM programs reach approximately 11 million students 
nationwide each year, according to the National Institute for STEM Education (NISE 2019). An 
extensive internet search showed many options for after-school STEM programs that focus on 
robotics and computer coding, but very few with a focus on construction or building sciences. 
One notable exception is the Block Kids Building Competition, described in Section 3.3. 
Infusing building industry skills into informal and after-school STEM programs may help 
increase awareness and engagement with STEM and building efficiency careers. 
3.4.1 Engage Students in STEM Early and Connect STEM to Building Efficiency 
Careers 
A 2018 Center for Childhood Creativity study found that experiences from infancy through third 
grade form the foundation for development of one’s critical thinking skills, including curiosity 
and inquiry, skepticism and questioning, and assessment and analysis—all vital skills for success 
in STEM careers (Hadani and Rood 2018). Therefore, activities that support development of 
skills for STEM careers should be included in primary education. 
Keeping students engaged in STEM activities is important throughout middle and high school to 
encourage their continued interest in STEM in college. A 2006 literature review conducted by 
ITEST Learning Research Center identified key success factors for any program designed to

encourage the pursuit of STEM degree programs. The research indicated that for students to 
pursue STEM careers, they must: 
• Be prepared and confident in their abilities to meet the demands of STEM degree 
programs 
• Identify a tangible STEM career that resonates with them 
• Have sufficient access to education and support within their family and peer networks 
• Experience motivation and interest in, and enjoyment of STEM topics (Dorsen, 
Carlson, and Goodyear 2006). 
 
STEM subjects are foundational to many trades involved in the building industry. For example, 
insulators and HVAC technicians should understand thermodynamics, pipefitters and welders 
should understand pressure dynamics, and technology such as computer-aided design and 
building information modeling are becoming increasingly common in construction 
projects. Organizations such as Build Your Future provide information and classroom resources 
to educate students, teachers, and parents about careers in construction. 
3.4.2 Engage School Counselors and Teachers to Promote Benefits of a 
Building Efficiency Career 
A study published in The Professional Counselor indicates that students begin developing career 
awareness in primary school, explore various careers pathways during middle school, and engage 
in career preparation and planning in high school (Sanders, Welfare, and Culver 2017). Teachers 
and school counselors are influential in guiding students on career opportunities and pathways, 
but they need information and support from industry to do so. In fact, 9 out of 10 school 
counselors surveyed at the American School Counselor Association conference held virtually in 
July 2020 indicated they do not have sufficient materials to expose students to building energy 
efficiency careers (NREL 2020). Presentations by professionals in the field followed by social 
media were reported to be the most effective pathways for engaging students. Salary information 
followed by videos describing and showing the profession were cited as the most compelling 
information for students to receive about an industry (NREL 2020). 
3.4.3 Connect Energy Efficiency to Digital and Gaming Skills of Children and 
Young Adults 
Efforts to teach children about energy efficiency through digital tools and gaming continue to 
evolve. Multiple projects funded by the European Union have resulted in games and interactive 
online tools that aim to make changes in consumer behavior as easy as possible. Research by 
Wright and Weidman in 2018 demonstrated that students who showed the most significant 
interest and understanding of construction were those who did not have parents working in 
construction industries, and who had more interest in digital hobbies (e.g., video games). The 
overwhelming theme from researchers’ interviews with students was that the students had not 
considered that their digital interests would be of value in the construction industry, or that the 
skills they had in designing 3D models would be useful (Wright and Weidman 2018).

3.4.4 Consider Internships as a Valuable Component of Construction 
Management Education 
The National Center for Construction Education and Research emphasizes the benefits of an 
internship for construction management students. A 2020 blog posted on the organization’s 
website states that the ideal internship program helps students learn how to work in a team 
environment while gaining knowledge of the craft. In addition, internships can help students 
learn to take initiative, communicate effectively, and learn practical skills such as cost-estimating 
and time management. Construction management internships should benefit the company and the 
intern, allowing each party to determine whether there is a good fit for future employment 
(Johanasen 2020). 
3.4.5 Appeal to Millennial and Generation Z Values 
A Gallup Poll and report titled “How Millennials Want to Live” indicates that millennials 
emphasize purpose over a paycheck (Gallup 2019). In other words, millennials must find 
meaning in their work, and the organizations they choose to work for must have a compelling 
mission and purpose. As was described in the previous section, appealing to younger 
generations’ values surrounding climate change, sustainability, and job security by promoting the 
energy efficiency savings of high-performance buildings and illustrating how the construction 
sector continued during the COVID-19 pandemic will help attract students to building energy 
efficiency careers. 
4 Conclusion 
The building energy efficiency sector has an opportunity to expand its labor force by 
intentionally recruiting from a more diverse pool of applicants that match the demographics of 
the nation. Successful recruitment of diverse populations must be followed with thoughtful 
retention policies that support the needs of various populations. Actively pursuing diversity, 
equity, and inclusion in workforce programs and policies can grow the building energy 
efficiency, sector, support local communities, and improve the lives of underserved Americans. 
Communities, employers, education and training organizations, and others can use the processes 
and best practices described in this report to develop organizational strategies to increase 
diversity, equity, and inclusion within their spheres of influence. A national effort aimed 
recruiting and retaining diverse and historically underserved populations for building energy 
efficiency careers will enable the United States to build a modern, sustainable infrastructure 
while simultaneously delivering an equitable clean energy transition, ensuring no communities 
are left behind.

Appendix: Additional Workforce Diversity Examples 
The following workforce diversity programs serve as additional examples of the types of efforts 
currently being implemented around the country. This is not intended to provide a 
comprehensive survey of workforce diversity efforts, but rather to showcase a sample of 
effective programs. The individual workforce diversity programs featured below may focus on 
one or several underrepresented populations. While there are differences in engaging each of 
these communities, many of the approaches used by successful workforce diversity programs are 
applicable across populations. Programs are arranged in alphabetical order by title. 
California Public Utilities Commission General Order 156 
In 2014, the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California 
Berkeley conducted a study of workforce issues for California investor-owned utilities, which 
included a summary of utility and public policies that promote workforce inclusion in the energy 
efficiency sector (Zabin et al. 2014). The following examples demonstrate some of the models 
for increasing participation of diverse businesses in the efficiency sector. 
Procurement: California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) General Order 156, issued in 
1988, requires utilities of a certain size to develop and implement programs to increase the 
utilization of women-, minority-, and service-disabled veteran-owned businesses. The 
procurement goals for each affected utility specify that 5%, 15%, and 1.5% of procurement 
dollars go to women-, minority-, and service-disabled veteran-owned contractors, respectively 
(Zabin et al. 2014). 
In 2015, the CPUC added LGBTQ-owned firms to its supplier diversity program, which includes 
women-, minority-, and disabled veteran-owned businesses. In 2018, the CPUC reported that 
0.11% ($38.8 million) of contracting work from utilities operating in California went to LGBTQcertified firms through the program. 
Since 2008, various agencies within Los Angeles adopted “community career” policies that 
require developers and contractors who build projects with public funding to meet hiring goals 
and sign a project labor agreement. The policies require 30%–40% of work to be completed by 
priority populations (residents in high-unemployment or high-poverty zip codes) of which 10% 
must be completed by disadvantaged workers (from low-income households, homeless, receiving 
public assistance, lacking a GED or high school diploma, history in the criminal justice system, 
single parents, or suffering from chronic unemployment) (Zabin et al. 2014). Similar contractor 
sourcing policies have been implemented at the California High Speed Rail Authority, City of 
San Francisco, City of Portland, Energy Trust of Oregon, City of Seattle, and Cuyahoga County, 
Ohio (Zabin et al. 2014). 
Contractor Training: From 2013 to 2014, the Southern California Regional Energy Network and 
Los Angeles County aimed to implement $30 million in energy efficiency retrofit projects while 
promoting local, small contractor participation (Zabin et al. 2014). The county partnered with the 
Emerald Cities Collaborative (ECC) to run the E-Contractor Academy, a seven-week training 
program to help contractors be successful in bidding on and completing public works projects. 
Workshop topics included how to bid on energy efficiency projects, certifications, safety, labor 
compliance, bonding, and estimating. The E-Contractor Academy was successful in training and

pre-qualifying small contractors, including those that did not focus on energy efficiency. 
However, there was an insufficient project pipeline to keep the number of trained contractors 
engaged in the program (Soto 2020). Additionally, the small contractors struggled to access 
sufficient bonding capacity to be able to bid on large projects. 
Com Ed Diverse Service Provider Incubator Program 
Com Ed, the investor-owned utility in the Chicago area, retains a contractor network for installing 
technologies that save energy through its business energy efficiency programs (Com Ed 2020). In 
2018, Com Ed launched its Diverse Energy Efficiency Service Provider Incubator Program with 
the intention of recruiting contractors from underrepresented populations (Doyle 2020). Com Ed 
provides funds for local organizations, such as the local Hispanic American Construction 
Industry Association, to recruit participants from minority-, women-, and veteran-owned 
businesses, as well as those with a Diverse Business Enterprise certification. The program 
consists of a series of workshops on energy efficiency, Com Ed’s rebate offerings and processes, 
employment lead generation, and relationship development with financial institutions for small 
business loans and lines of credit. Participants also receive mentorship and engage in networking 
opportunities. 
Massachusetts Clean Energy Center Successful Women in Clean Energy Program 
Each year, the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (Mass CEC) collects data on the 
demographics of the clean energy workforce in Massachusetts. The data inform targeted 
programs to support underrepresented groups. When findings indicated that women comprised 
only 26% of clean energy hires, Mass CEC implemented the Successful Women in Clean Energy 
program in 2016 to address specific barriers women might face in accessing clean energy careers 
(Fitzpatrick 2014). The program supported 2 cohorts of 12 participants who received 15 weeks 
of training, enrollment in a higher education course, and placement in a six-month paid 
fellowship with an employer in the clean energy industry. Mass CEC partnered with a training 
provider to run the program and address specific challenges faced by the participants, including 
coaching on financial literacy and soft skills. As of 2020, 50% of all program participants are 
still employed in the clean energy industry (Jacques 2020). 
Green City Force’s Ameri Corps 
Green City Force’s (GCF’s) Service Corps is an Ameri Corps program that works with young 
adults ages 18–24 who reside in the New York City Housing Authority to prepare them for green 
economy careers through service. Being part of the Service Corps requires a full-time 
commitment that includes service, training, and skill-building experiences related to sustainable 
buildings and communities. GCF takes a holistic approach and provides training in a range of 
areas from composting to energy efficiency. 
GCF includes alumni initiatives to build inroads into specific careers within the green economy, 
such as solar and energy efficiency. GCF believes that young New York City Housing Authority 
residents are uniquely positioned to catalyze change in public housing communities while 
building skills, earning certifications, and gaining experience to help achieve economic 
prosperity. GCF emphasizes partnerships with residents, agencies, local and citywide 
organizations, funders, and employers to realize the change they envision.

Laney College Building Efficiency for a Sustainable Tomorrow Center 
The Laney College Building Efficiency for a Sustainable Tomorrow (BEST) Center, funded in 
part by the National Science Foundation’s Advancing Technological Education Award, was 
created to support the professional development of instructors in building science technician 
education programs (National Science Foundation n.d.). The BEST Center coordinates a model 
curriculum, hosts teach-the-teacher events, supports the development and use of instructional 
laboratories at community colleges, and provides student resources such as career pathways and 
job boards (BEST Center n.d.). By focusing on instructors, the BEST Center helps community 
and technical college programs around the country stay current with industry research and 
technology and provides networking opportunities across institutions to help leverage instructor 
expertise and resources. 
The BEST Center partners with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and industry partners to 
provide access to state-of-the-art building technology and energy management tools for 
instructional use. Participating programs gain access to a network of similar programs and 
industry advisors, best practices for classroom instruction, curriculum and program design 
exchange, project- and problem-based learning opportunities, teaching laboratory specifications, 
workshops and networking events, and other benefits. The resources provided by the BEST 
Center allow instructors and community college and technical programs to maintain and update 
their curriculum, though access to appropriate laboratory equipment can still be a barrier for 
developing programs. 
South Seattle College Sustainable Building Science Technology Program 
South Seattle College offers a Bachelor of Applied Science in Sustainable Building Science 
Technology (SBST), which is a 90-credit program designed for working professionals (South 
Seattle College n.d.). Tuition is approximately $25,000 over the two-year program, and students 
often receive assistance from their employers, scholarships, or veterans’ benefits. Veterans 
without benefits from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs pay half-priced tuition. The SBST 
program partners with local organizations, such as Apprenticeship & Nontraditional 
Employment for Women, to recruit participants. 
The courses are offered in a combined online and face-to-face format to minimize interference 
with work schedules. Courses meet in person one weekend per month and typically involve field 
trips and hands-on experiences with industry partners. Students are required to earn 19 credits 
via internships and work experience practicums. The SBST program works with local industry 
partners to provide internship placements based on student capabilities and employer needs. The 
program is designed to help students develop technical knowledge (such as building and energy 
science), technological skills (via hands-on experience with building equipment), and 
professional skills (such as networking, resume, or portfolio development, along with using 
Linked In). 
Students are recruited through local partners that work with diverse populations, and the 2020 
cohort is more than 50% nonwhite and 25% female, with strong representation from veterans 
(Abercrombie 2020). The SBST program’s active technical advisory board of buildings industry 
representatives helps guide the program to address industry needs and provides connections for 
internship placements. Typical cohorts consist of 12–20 students, although the program aims to 
expand over the next few years. Resources that would support expansion include access to

hands-on building equipment, virtual or 3D models of buildings to identify equipment 
performance, building data to support curriculum development, and assistance to help instructors 
deepen their expertise. 
Workforce Development Council of Seattle-King County Upskill/Backfill 
Vocational Training 
A 2016 study from the Seattle Jobs Initiative estimated worker shortages in various industries, 
including a shortfall of 676 workers in the electrical, HVAC/refrigeration, and 
plumbing/pipefitting trades (Klaeysen 2016). Based on this projection, the Emerald Cities 
Collaborative (ECC) secured a grant from the Workforce Development Council of Seattle-King 
County, along with leveraged funds to “upskill” workers to operate HVAC and electrical, 
plumbing, and mechanical systems in high-performance buildings and to train entry-level 
employees for newly created positions (Workforce Training and Education Coordinating Board 
2018). ECC worked with industry partners to adapt a one-year HVAC/refrigeration curriculum 
into a five-month evening and weekend training program. The effort also included partnerships 
with local employers and community organizations to provide hands-on learning and recruit and 
refer participants. 
The first cohort aimed to upskill 22 incumbent building operators in tools and techniques to 
improve energy and water efficiency and enroll in the “Building Operation Certification 1” 
issued by the Northwest Energy Efficiency Council. The second cohort provided 32 entry-level 
trainees with HVAC/refrigeration training for building operators and helped participants earn 
certificates of completion from the Construction Industry Training Council of Washington 
(Emerald Cities Collaborative 2019). Across the two cohorts, 52% of the trainees were people of 
color, and all of the trainings in the second cohort were required to meet Workforce Innovation 
and Opportunity Act criteria: underemployed or unemployed, very low-income, formerly 
incarcerated, limited English, or other Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act 
characteristics. ECC partnered with Seattle Jobs Initiative to provide a career navigator to help 
trainees prepare resumes, apply for employment, or secure promotions. By August 2019, 81% of 
the entry-level participants completed the trainings, with 38% hired or promoted between March 
and August 2019.
