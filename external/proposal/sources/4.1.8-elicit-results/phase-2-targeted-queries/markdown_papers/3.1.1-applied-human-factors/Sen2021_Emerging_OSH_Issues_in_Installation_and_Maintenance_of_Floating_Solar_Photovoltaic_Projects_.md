Objective: Emerging issues of occupational safety and health (OSH) in floating solar 
photovoltaic projects (FSPV) have rarely been addressed to achieve the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). The current scoping review has been planned to demonstrate 
OSH issues experienced by the workers engaged in the installation and maintenance of FSPV 
projects and existing ergonomics design interventions in the solar photovoltaic industry with 
a focus on the FSPV sector.
Methods: A literature review was conducted from four major electronic databases (Science 
Direct, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus) using predefined keywords and following 
the PRISMA framework for the period 1965–2020. A total of 49 studies under five headings, 
namely a) overview of key reasons for the emergence of floating solar photovoltaic projects, b) 
occupational risks of workers engaged in the solar PV industry/FSPV sector, c) occupational 
risks in workplaces/occupations similar to floating solar photovoltaics projects, d) availability of 
training modules and occupational standards, and e) design interventions/approaches in the solar 
PV industry/floating photovoltaics sector were analyzed.
Results: It emerged that workers are exposed to multifarious occupational risk factors such 
as heat, solar radiation, ergonomic risks, electrocution, fire, hazardous substances, adverse 
weather conditions, and psychosocial factors. These risks have not been adequately 
addressed with required interventions in the FSPV sector. Intervention opportunities include 
designing innovative tools, lowering of loads, redesigning workplace layouts, introducing job 
aids, automation, task rotation, job enlargement, design of training modules, OSH standards 
and changes in work organization/shift, etc.
Conclusion: This review is a first-of-its-kind effort to highlight the contextual risk factors in 
the emerging FSPV sector and the need for addressing them through ergonomics design 
interventions for successfully achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

Introduction
Increasing the share of renewable energy in the total energy mix is an important global 
priority for a decarbonized world. Among the many clean energy sources, utilizing the 
Sun’s infinite power is a preferred option for countries where solar irradiation is high. 
Recent global growth in solar photovoltaic projects has been prompted due to climate 
change concerns, decreasing project costs, and greater adoption of clean energy by

many countries to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 
An estimate by the International Renewable Energy Agency 
indicates that by 2050, the share of solar photovoltaic gen­
eration would be 25% of the total global generation mix 
amounting to 8519 GW with an anticipated investment of 
$132 billion between the years 2019–50 and job creation for 
almost 18.7 million people.1 The different kinds of solar 
photovoltaic projects include ground-mounted, roof-top, 
canal-top, offshore, and floating.2 In recent years, floating 
solar photovoltaic (FSPV) projects have seen exponential 
growth because of their distinct advantages over other types 
of solar photovoltaic installations. FSPV projects have been 
shown to have a global potential of 400 GWp.3 These 
projects are implemented on lakes, ponds, reservoirs of 
dams and thermal power plants, water basins, mine quarries, 
water treatment plants, and over other water bodies.
OSH Issues in the Installation and 
Maintenance of Floating Solar 
Photovoltaic Projects
A significant portion of the installation and maintenance of 
FSPV projects involves manual work on both land and 
water. The occupational risks on land and water associated 
with a typical floating solar photovoltaic project are depicted 
in Figure 1. The workflow involves the unloading, 
transportation, and fabrication of unwieldy solar photovol­
taic panels, gaskets, frames, bulky floats/pontoons, and elec­
trical components. As a result, the workers are exposed to 
several occupational risk factors such as repetitive work, 
frequent bending, awkward postures, and handling heavy 
loads. These are potential occupational risk factors for devel­
oping Work-related musculoskeletal disorders.4 Such disor­
ders include injuries to the nerves, muscles, joints, 
cartilages, ligaments, tendons, and other body parts. Some 
examples of such disorders include carpal tunnel syndrome, 
epicondylitis, and neck pain.5 Work-related musculoskeletal 
disorders (WMSDs) are linked to lost man-days, low pro­
ductivity, and increased healthcare costs.6 A labor survey in 
the UK has revealed that 6.9 million working days were lost 
due to WMSDs in 2018/19.7
Work on a continually moving floating platform and 
high wind speeds put postural constraints on the workers. 
There are also possibilities of falling into water and expo­
sure to an aquatic environment. Vibration can also be an 
occupational risk when using vibrating tools for assem­
bling panels on frames/floats. The vibrating tools are also 
a source of noise which may lead to noise-induced hearing 
loss.4
During the anchoring and mooring process, divers may 
suffer from hypothermia and run the risk of drowning.

While installing solar panels on the floats, remotely 
located installation points may be unreachable, leading to 
work in confined spaces and chances of cuts and bruises 
from sharp objects/edges. Tools, clamps, and bolts may 
fall into the water, feet can get stuck into crevices between 
walkways and pontoons, and workers may trip due to 
connectors and cables laying around. During the commis­
sioning and charging of the system, workers may be 
exposed to electrocution and fire hazards. Outdoor work 
for long hours in a hot and humid environment can lead to 
heat illnesses, dehydration, and fatigue. The workers can 
also experience glare from the solar panels’ reflective 
surfaces and the surrounding water body. Glare may be 
direct or indirect and can degrade vision.5 Glare can also 
affect productivity by making it difficult for workers to 
install solar panels and associated components (inverters, 
wires, and cables) as visually demanding tasks are often 
involved in fixing bolts/nuts to assemble solar panels on 
the frames and connecting pontoons.
Installation is carried out during the day leading to 
prolonged exposure to solar radiation, which may have 
adverse effects on the skin, eyes, and immune system.8 
The solar radiation is amplified by the reflection from the 
solar panels and the water body around the FSPV project. 
Adverse health effects of solar radiation include cataract, 
melanoma (affecting the eye), pterygium, macular degen­
eration, and skin cancer.8 Workers may be engaged in 
FSPV projects located on lakes/water bodies at high alti­
tudes. Under such atmospheric conditions, there can be 
a reduction in the work capacity, and workers may suffer 
from the effects of cold stress.5
Since FSPV is an emerging sector requiring new skill 
sets, most workers are likely to be inexperienced and 
untrained. These factors can also lead to errors, which 
might result in injuries and even major accidents.
Predictive and preventive maintenance activities also 
carry several types of occupational risks. The presence of 
a water body around an electrical system (water and elec­
tricity do not mix) presents additional risks of falling into 
the water while cleaning or replacing the solar panels and 
other parts. Maintenance during rain, snowfall, during the 
night, or under extreme heat can cause serious illnesses. 
Floating solar photovoltaic projects are also exposed to 
risks from severe weather conditions. On September 9, 
2019, a fire broke out in the 13.7 Megawatt Chiba 
Yamakura Floating Mega Solar Plant in Japan after 
a severe typhoon.9 The fire destroyed several solar panels 
and associated structures. Workers engaged in the repair 
and maintenance post such events are exposed to even 
more diverse and unknown occupational risks while 
removing and replacing damaged panels, floaters, and 
electrical equipment.
OSH Aspects in FSPV Projects and Its 
Relationship with Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs)
For an industry/sector to be sustainable, a safe and healthy 
workforce is an essential pre-requisite. The same is also 
true for the floating solar photovoltaic sector. The United 
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has set seven­
teen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be 
attained by the year 2030.10 An important goal is to ensure 
the availability of affordable and clean energy (Goal 7). 
This objective is closely interlinked with the Paris 
Agreement on Climate Change reached in 2015,1 where 
several countries have committed to a transition towards 
renewable energy. These global initiatives are key drivers 
for the rapid growth of the solar PV industry and the 
emergence of jobs in the solar PV value chain. Many 
SDGs are closely related to the OSH issues in the installa­
tion and maintenance of FSPV projects. They include Goal 
3 (Good Health & Well Being) and Goal 8 (Decent Work 
and Economic Growth). A framework depicting the OSH 
concerns in FSPV projects and their relationship with 
SDGs is shown in Figure 2. Ensuring the safety and health 
of the workers is a pre-requisite in attaining both Goals 3 
and 8.
Compromising with OSH issues will ultimately affect 
the ability to provide clean and affordable energy and 
climate action since negative OSH outcomes have both 
direct and indirect costs. Moreover, components of SDGs 
are closely interlinked with each other.
Several studies have established the nexus between 
safety and sustainability. Gilding et al11 emphasize using 
safety as a primary vehicle to achieve sustainability for 
human benefit and successful business practices. In a study 
among 251 manufacturing plants in Canada, safety culture 
was shown to be associated with indicators of performance 
linked to sustainable development.12 Jilcha and Kitaw13 
mention that safe and healthy workplaces, innovation in 
workplaces, better knowledge of safety, and controlled 
environment are associated with sustainable development. 
Nawaz et al14 state the importance of considering the link 
between safety and sustainability based on several com­
monalities such as social, financial, and environmental

factors. Therefore, addressing the OSH issues through 
appropriate interventions in the FSPV sector at the microlevel and solar PV industry as a whole must be an integral 
part of the efforts towards a sustainable and decarbonized 
world.
Need for the Study
Floating solar photovoltaic sites are new and emerging 
workplaces that are different from other kinds of solar 
photovoltaic installations but vastly different from indus­
trial shop floors involving a combination of ergonomics 
factors. Occupational risks such as possibilities of colli­
sions with objects, electrocution, slips, falls from height, 
strains, sprains, fire, mud, water, inclement weather, 
mechanical injury, and wildlife have been identified in 
solar PV plants.15 A report of the European Agency for 
Safety & Health at Work (EU-OSHA) indicates that skill 
shortages are prevalent in the renewable energy industries 
due to fast-paced innovations. Thus, hazardous work is 
often carried out by less-skilled workers.16 This mismatch 
in skills and constantly changing workplace layouts are 
making the work more challenging, giving rise to several 
OSH issues. In addition, other emerging risks identified 
include non-standard work arrangements, weak OSH cul­
ture, hazards from nanomaterials, and issues related to the 
human-machine interface.16 According to another report 
by EU-OSHA, specific OSH risks related to installation, 
maintenance, and decommissioning of small scale solar 
energy projects include solar radiation, hazardous chemi­
cals, fall from heights, slips and trips, awkward postures, 
new kinds of electrical risks (due to new technologies) and 
adverse weather conditions.17
Moreover, every new worksite may have its unique 
work organization, microclimate, and special skill sets 
requirements. This scenario gives rise to several concerns 
regarding the contextual occupational risks on account of 
Figure 2 Interrelationships between OSH issues in installation and maintenance of FSPV projects and sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP).

the mismatch between man and machine. There is limited 
knowledge about the OSH aspects and existing ergo­
nomics interventions in the fast-growing FSPV sector. 
Therefore, there is an urgent need to map the OSH aspects 
of the solar photovoltaic industry with a particular empha­
sis on the floating solar photovoltaic sector.
Materials and Methods
The review objective was to explore all risk factors influ­
encing the workers engaged in FSPV projects from an 
OSH perspective and understanding existing approaches 
and future scope for addressing the problem areas. The 
review process started with formulating some research 
questions to understand the different aspects, especially 
in line with the present paper’s objective. The research 
questions are as follows:
●Q1: What are the various features of FSPV projects 
and reasons for the growth of the sector in recent 
years?
●Q2: What are the different kinds of physical, chemi­
cal, environmental, psychosocial, and organizationrelated risks and their effect on workers in the float­
ing solar photovoltaic sector and workplaces/occupa­
tions similar to the work environment (aquatic) of an 
FSPV project?
●Q3: 
Are 
training 
programs/modules 
and 
Occupational Safety & Health (OSH) standards 
available for the FSPV sector?
●Q4: What are the existing design approaches in the 
solar PV industry (with emphasis on the FSPV sector) 
as prevention and/ or OSH risk mitigation strategy?
●Q5: What are the future opportunities for ergonomics 
design interventions in the FSPV sector?
In accordance with the review questions, search terms 
were defined, and a literature review was carried out by 
accessing the electronic databases of Science Direct, 
Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus in 
a structured manner. The search period was selected from 
the year 1965 to 2020, and published papers in English 
were considered. The search terms and the various combi­
nations used to identify online records were solar photo­
voltaics, floating solar photovoltaics, psychosocial risks, 
environmental risks, occupational health and safety stan­
dards, training, green jobs, work organization, ergonomics 
design interventions, design, aquaculture, shipyard work­
ers, and occupational health and safety risks.
The current study presents a scoping review that has 
been carried out by referring to the guidelines for conduct­
ing scoping reviews using the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
framework.18 The step-by-step search methodology is 
depicted in the flowchart in Figure 3.
The inclusion criteria for the online search using the 
electronic databases of Science Direct, Google Scholar, 
Web of Science, and Scopus for shortlisting studies for the 
review was the presence of the search terms in the title, 
abstract, or keywords. The reference list of identified papers 
was also searched for additional studies. This resulted in the 
extraction of 193 studies. A total of 22 additional studies/ 
conference proceedings from other sources published by 
stakeholders/researchers in the solar photovoltaic industry 
and related OSH standards were also considered. These 
studies/resources were uploaded into a database manager, 
and duplicates were removed, resulting in 162 papers/ 
resources. These records were further screened, and repeated 
studies were excluded. A total of 54 papers were found 
eligible, and full texts were read. Some papers were further 
excluded as they were not specific to the review objectives. 
The online search resulted in the final shortlisting of 49 
papers. The full papers were analyzed and divided into five 
broad headings, namely a) overview of key reasons for the 
emergence of floating solar photovoltaic projects, b) occu­
pational risks of workers engaged in the solar PV industry/ 
FSPV sector, c) occupational risks in workplaces/occupa­
tions similar to floating solar photovoltaics projects, d) 
availability of training modules and occupational standards, 
and e) design interventions/approaches in the solar PV 
industry/floating photovoltaics sector. The future scope for 
each paper was also studied. Reports, textbooks, documents, 
and online news articles relevant to the present paper were 
also considered for highlighting different aspects. After the 
review of the papers, the outcome was compared to inter­
vention approaches at various hierarchical levels to under­
stand the knowledge gaps and opportunities for ergonomics 
design interventions.5
Results
The review has been arranged under the different broad 
headings, as mentioned in the methodology section. The 
data/information representing the key findings extracted 
from the shortlisted papers are discussed in the following

Key Reasons for the Emergence of FSPV 
Projects
A total of eleven studies concerned with the FSPV sector 
that captured the various aspects of floating solar PV 
projects were considered. The papers were reviewed and 
arranged according to the parameter, author, region of 
study, study type, and key findings. The findings/highlights 
are represented in Table 1.
OSH Risk Factors Associated with Solar/ 
Floating Solar PV System
Ten studies that contained the identification of occupational 
risks in the solar PV industry (emphasizing on floating solar 
photovoltaic projects) were reviewed. The gathered informa­
tion was sorted and presented in terms of the occupational risk 
factors, authors, region, study type, findings, and future scope 
to mitigate the risks from an OSH perspective (Table 2).

Occupational Risk Factors in Workplaces/ 
Occupations Similar to FSPV Sites
As discussed earlier, the presence of water in the FSPV 
work environment presents additional occupational risks. 
Seven studies in workplaces/occupations such as aquacul­
ture, shipping, lobstermen, and port workers were 
reviewed to understand the risks in occupations where 
the interface with water is involved. Aquaculture workers 
face several ergonomic, physical, biological, and other 
work-related risks.39–42 Shipyard workers are at the risk 
of falling from heights, electrocution, fire, explosion, 
object-related injury, and drowning.43 Port workers are 
exposed to occupational risks from toxic substances, 
noise, dust, extreme temperature, vibration, and ultraviolet 
radiation.44 The task of mooring in FSPV projects where 
boats are used is similar to work involved in jobs such as 
lobster hunting. Lobstermen in the northeast of the USA 
were exposed to ergonomic risks such as force, awkward 
postures, and repetition, resulting in low back pain and 
discomfort in the hand and wrists. The researchers suggest 
using ergonomics interventions to help in the handling of 
materials.45 During the installation of FSPV projects; 
divers are engaged in the mooring process, load testing, 
and anchoring. The divers are required to work underwater 
(sometimes at significant depths depending on the water 
body) for prolonged periods which exposes them to sev­
eral OSH risks. A study on South Korean fishery divers 
revealed that 84.7% of them showed symptoms of decom­
pression sickness (DCS).46 FSPV workers are mostly 
engaged in outdoor work, which exposes them to long 
hours of solar radiation. A study on seafarers in 
Germany showed the incidence of actinic keratosis as

programs for installers, training of users and technicians, 
capacity building programs, and technically qualified 
installers are required.49–52 The need for universal train­
ing modules with local improvisations was felt.49 Easy 
availability of skilled technicians (from the vicinity of the 
project) will ensure the successful implementation of the 
solar PV project, especially in rural areas. In addition, 
training needs and content for users/technicians may dif­
fer from project to project in terms of technology, design, 
layout, and other local factors. Hence, training of the 
local technical personnel and users were found to be 
crucial in achieving the success of rural solar PV 
projects.49 Some available training programs include the 
Training of Photovoltaic Installers (PVTRIN), which is 
an accreditation and training scheme for some European 
countries for personnel engaged in small-scale PV 
systems.53 The paucity of education and training has 
also been identified as a barrier in the renewable energy 
industry, resulting in a shortfall of qualified personnel in 
many countries.54
In this review, some OSH standards were found, like 
the National Standards on Health & Safety at solar PV 
power plant, formulated by the Skills Council for Green 
Jobs in India.55 Regulations of the Occupational Safety 
and Health Administration (OSHA) applicable to PV 
installations are covered in a) Occupational Safety and 
Health Standards (Part 1910) and b) Safety and Health 
Regulations 
for 
Construction 
(Part 
1926).56 
The 
Queensland Code of Practice is aimed at the safety and 
health of workers associated with the life cycle of solar 
farms.57 The code emphasizes the need to design safe 
solar farms by removing hazards at the planning and 
design stage. It recommends that design engineers asso­
ciated with solar farms should acquire requisite compe­
tencies (such as health and safety rules, risk management, 
design standards, etc.) to minimize occupational safety 
and health risks. The Newport Beach Fire Department 
has specified standards for designing layouts and instal­
ling roof-top solar PV projects to ensure fire safety.58 The 
Newport Beach Fire Department’s guidelines recommend 
the provision of walkways and marking of PV compo­
nents. The walkways or sufficient clearance space along 
the solar PV installation-frames help the workers in safe 
and comfortable movement under various postures during 
installation and maintenance activities. Besides, these 
walkways also serve as escape routes for the evacuation 
of workers during exigencies.
Design Interventions/Approaches in the 
Solar PV Industry
One of the objectives of this present review is to under­
stand opportunities for ergonomics design interventions in 
the FSPV sector to address the emerging OSH issues. 
Therefore, in order to understand the existing design 
approaches (for identifying research gaps) in the solar 
PV industry, fourteen papers were reviewed. The different 
design approaches in the solar PV industry are depicted in 
Table 3. The studies considered are arranged in terms of 
author, region, type of solar PV project/product, type of 
study, design scope, and design objective.
Research Gap and Opportunities for 
Ergonomics Design Interventions
The scoping review and its subsequent comparison with 
the intervention approach at various hierarchical levels are 
shown in Figure 4. The different types of intervention 
approaches have been taken from Bridger, 2018.5 It was 
revealed that although some studies and interventions have 
addressed the multifarious occupational risks (indicated by 
blue lines) in the solar PV industry in general, most of the 
occupational risks (indicated by broken red lines) remain 
unaddressed. No study was found that addressed or pro­
poses to address the OSH issues in the floating solar PV 
sector from an ergonomics design perspective. This pre­
sents a vast opportunity for adopting design intervention 
strategies at a stage when the FSPV industry is nascent and 
expanding fast. These circumstances are likely to make 
stakeholders more responsive to adapting and implement­
ing these opportunities to ensure the workforce’s OSH.
The research gaps (indicated as broken red lines in 
Figure 4) or the unexplored interventions can be divided 
into bottom-up, top-down, and same-level interventions 
(refer to Figure 5). Bottom-up interventions include a) 
lowering of loads, b) redesigning of layout, c) provision 
of job aids, and d) changing tools. Top-down interven­
tions include a) automation, b) task rotation) job enlar­
gement and d) change in work organization. Same level 
interventions include a) workplace redesign and b) 
improvement in the work environment. The intervention 
strategy/plan will depend on FSPV project design, dura­
tion, location, type of equipment and materials used, 
work organization, funding, the involvement of top 
management, safety policy, statutory and local regula­
tions, and most importantly, commitment to affirmative 
action on Occupational Safety & Health. A majority of

the work associated with FSPV plants involves signifi­
cant Manual Material Handling (MMH), including the 
transportation of solar PV panels, lifting of floaters, 
assembling of pontoons/panels, and construction of scaf­
foldings. These activities involve awkward postures, and 
working on a continually swaying floating platform near 
water. These tasks can be optimized by primarily 
attempting bottom-up design interventions that are rela­
tively easier to implement and require relatively little 
investment. This is especially important when the instal­
lation of FSPV projects is of short duration and involves 
a large workforce. Top-down interventions such as auto­
mation will require huge investments, while task rota­
tion/job enlargement will be difficult to implement in

can resolve the issues. Protecting the workers from the 
effects 
of 
solar 
radiation 
is 
critically 
essential. 
Explorations of designing the head and eye protection 
products, developing protective clothing for covering the 
skin, conducting awareness programs on the adverse 
health effects of solar radiation, and imparting training 
among the workers are required for this purpose. As 
discussed earlier, various aspects of the FSPV system 
can be considered for design and redesign.
The different man-machine interfaces in a typical 
FSPV workplace, occupational risk factors, occupational 
diseases, and proposed future scope from an ergonomics 
design perspective are shown in Table 4. This will allow 
interested stakeholders to understand specific areas of 
intervention better and analyze their relationship with 
safety, productivity, and cost-effectiveness.
Discussion
This scoping review was carried out to understand the 
reasons for the emergence of FSPV projects and OSH 
issues in the emerging FSPV sector. It aimed to find out 
whether those issues have been appropriately addressed 
and the future scope for interventions from an ergonomics 
design perspective to aid in successfully attaining the 
related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We dis­
cuss the findings of this review in the following sections to 
get a holistic picture of existing research and the way 
ahead.
The Emergence of FSPV Projects
A major reason for the emergence of FSPV projects is that 
they do not require land acquisition (land acquisition is 
a sensitive socio-economic issue in many countries).2

There is also an abundance of water reservoirs and other 
water-bodies globally. Moreover, FSPV is more efficient 
than ground-mounted SPV.19 It can be combined with 
hydroelectric plants26 and reduces evaporation while pro­
tecting the aquatic environment apart from other advantages. 
A review study informs that combined use of FSPV and 
aquaculture will help in moving towards a sustainable green 
economy by fulfilling the needs of water, energy, and food 
and preservation of the ecosystem.27
FSPVs can also help in environmental protection by 
reducing coal consumption. A 10 Megawatt FSPV plant 
study revealed that a huge quantity of coal could be saved 
along with the significant reduction of carbon dioxide 
emission during the lifetime of the plant.19 Hence, FSPV 
projects are becoming more and more preferred in many 
countries from a sustainability perspective.
Installation of FSPV projects involves a relatively 
higher cost due to floating platforms’ construction, anchor­
ing, and mooring. These are likely to be offset by better 
efficiency due to innovative designs and improved 
technology.74 In most FSPV projects, the material used 
in the manufacture of floaters/pontoons consists of Highdensity polyethylene. This material has been found to have 
an adequate load-bearing capacity and is resistant to ultra­
violet radiation.21
The environmental impact of FSPV plants, in the long 
run, include deterioration of water quality, loss of aquatic 
species and avian habitat, loss of recreational value, and 
creation of waste (damaged panels, floaters, cables, bat­
teries, etc.).3
OSH Issues in the FSPV Sector
The reviewed studies revealed the existence of various 
occupational risk factors. The problems mainly emanate 
from the mismatches between the capabilities of the work­
ers and the workplace factors. The occupational risks from 
equipment/tools include electrocution, exposure to hazar­
dous substances, fire, and ergonomic risks.31,33,36,37 The 
work environment’s occupational risks include working 
for long hours in extreme temperatures and work require­
ments under strong winds, hail, typhoons, near/with water, 
etc.29,30
Solar PV projects are usually located in areas where 
solar irradiation is high and involves outdoor work. 
Therefore, heat stress is a critical occupational risk factor 
for solar workers. A report by the International Labour 
Organization (ILO) indicates that in 2030 heat stress is 
likely to result in a loss of 2.2% of the total global 
working hours.75 In a study on solar workers in Mexico, 
it was found that the conditions of work (heat-related) 
were beyond the recommended exposure limits. In the 
same study, it was also found that acclimatized workers 
had a higher work capacity than non-acclimatized work­
ers, although all work had to stop during a heatwave. To 
avoid the ill effects of heat, the authors recommend sche­
duling heavy tasks for early morning and before 
evening.30 Kim and Lee76 also inform that there is 
expected to be a loss in working capacity (ultimately 
affecting productivity) in 52 occupations in the Republic 
of Korea due to the rise in Wet-bulb Globe Temperature 
(WBGT) as a result of climate change. They recommend 
providing real-time information to workers to help them 
understand the causes and effects of heat stress. Apart 
from heat stress, the workers are also exposed to solar 
radiation.
The intensity of exposure is further increased by the 
reflection of sunlight from the solar photovoltaic panels 
and the surrounding water body on which the FSPV pro­
ject is installed. This prolonged exposure can severely 
affect the eyes and the skin, thereby limiting working 
ability and years of working life.8
The long-term effects of occupational exposure to solar 
radiation also include different types of skin cancer.77 
FSPV workers can be protected from the health effects 
of solar radiation (a human carcinogen) by providing 
shades, rest areas, breaks through job design, especially 
during the hottest part of the day, adequate sun-safety 
training on the ill effects of solar radiation, use of sun­
glasses, headgear, sunscreens, sun-protective clothing and 
medical check-ups for detecting early signs of cancer.8,78 
With many workers entering the FSPV sector, these early 
interventions can help prevent both short-term and longterm health effects of solar radiation.
Bakhiyi et al33 report several ergonomic risks (eg, 
awkward postures and heavy loads lifting) may severely 
compromise the OSH of the workers. White and Doherty31 
reported the safety issues involved with the installation 
and maintenance of solar PV panels. They mention the 
risk of electrocution from solar modules, inverters, and 
transformers. Other occupational risks to the personnel 
working with such systems include arc flash, wind speeds, 
fire, solar heating, and fall from elevated positions. 
Another potential risk is that the PV system cannot be 
turned off, and the solar panel may generate electricity in 
the presence of any light source.31 This aspect should be 
kept in mind, particularly by maintenance personnel

engaged in cleaning and replacing solar panels. There are 
also increased risks of electrical leakage in FSPV sites due 
to a highly humid environment.3
Kamenopoulos 
and 
Tsoutsos29 
followed 
the 
Operational Risk Management (ORM) methodology to 
identify three risk categories in the operation and main­
tenance of solar PV systems. These are namely natural 
(lighting, winds, dust, etc.), man-made (vandalism/theft), 
and technological (electrocution, fire, etc.). Aman et al 
201537 mention the toxic substances associated with dif­
ferent components of a solar PV installation which can 
cause adverse health effects. Ammonia used in solar PV 
modules can cause irritation to the skin and eyes. Arsenic 
can cause lung infection and can affect several other 
organs. Cadmium used in solar cells and Polybrominated 
biphenyls used in solar panel inverters are carcinogenic. 
Lead used in electrical components can damage the ner­
vous system.37 In addition, other toxic substances men­
tioned in Table 2 also have deleterious health effects which 
need to be neutralized through interventions. Use of safe 
materials during manufacturing, design, and use of appro­
priate PPE during installation and maintenance, and safe 
disposal should be adopted for the workers’ safety and 
health. According to a study, work-life imbalance and 
job insecurity were found as major psychosocial risk fac­
tors in green-collar jobs.38 Age, gender, wages, socioeconomic status, statutory requirements, history of inju­
ries, and physiological capabilities of the workers should 
also be considered while deploying workers since they 
have an association with musculoskeletal diseases.4,79
FSPV workers are also exposed to risks from the 
microclimate, which might present extreme temperatures, 
exposure to toxic chemicals, excessive noise, and vibration 
from the use of tools/equipment. Cleaning of solar panels 
during maintenance and repair/replacement of floaters 
involves prolonged work with water. Prolonged wet-work 
is a potential risk factor for the development of occupa­
tional skin disorders, such as Irritant Contact Dermatitis,80 
and necessary interventions should be adopted to prevent 
such disorders. Divers are exposed to several occupational 
risks of working underwater during installation for anchor­
ing and mooring and also during maintenance. Even with 
self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA), 
divers may suffer from decompression sickness (DCS) and 
face a hypothermic and hyperbaric milieu.81
Adverse weather conditions such as lightning, hail and 
strong winds have been identified as a major risk factor for 
the workers.29 Inclement weather can also affect the FSPV 
installation itself.9 Suitable design interventions such as 
safety harness, storm shelters and PPE for occupational 
safety and health can be adopted to protect the workers. In 
addition, scheduling of installation and maintenance jobs 
should consider the weather forecast data and requisite 
safety training should be provided for emergency evacua­
tion during such events. Also, several companies/manu­
facturers are designing FSPV projects so as to neutralize 
adverse weather events such as storms.82 We are of the 
view that if suitable preventive measures such as design 
interventions are adopted at the project sites, the workers 
can be provided with a safe working environment at dif­
ferent locations in spite of many challenges.
Thus, it can be deciphered that the occupational risks 
are multifarious and may affect the worker singly or in 
combination, creating unsafe conditions. No studies that 
measured or analyzed the occupational risks in the FSPV 
sector were found in this review.
Perspectives from OSH Risks in Similar 
Occupations
It emerges that many occupational risks are common 
between FSPV sites and other occupations/workplaces 
associated with an aquatic work environment (aquaculture, 
fishing, shipyard/port workers, etc.). They include pro­
longed wet-work, ergonomic risks, noise, dust, toxic sub­
stances, 
fall 
from 
heights, 
ultraviolet 
radiation, 
electrocution, vibration, and high temperatures.
FSPV workers are not only exposed to the already 
existing risks of the solar PV industry but run the risks 
from aquatic organisms, adverse water composition, pos­
sibilities of drowning, and possibly greater psychosocial 
risks. This makes risk mitigation in the FSPV sector even 
more critical. Future intervention scope may include con­
tinuous supervision and communication with divers, pro­
vision of rescue divers when diving activities are 
performed, surveillance, occupational risk awareness, risk 
minimization, and understanding occupational disease cau­
sation pathways.
Need for Training and OSH Standards
The review did not reveal the existence of training pro­
grams or universal OSH standards in this sector in parti­
cular. Lack of training modules and OSH standards 
specific to the floating solar sector also means that 
untrained workers are being exposed to complex and 
unknown work protocols. The assumption that prior

work experience in the execution of roof-top and groundmounted solar PV projects would be sufficient may not 
be correct. A study has shown that workers’ training is 
positively 
associated 
with 
occupational 
safety.83 
Therefore, proper training before the deployment of 
workers is critical in avoiding unsafe acts and achieving 
efficient and error-free work. The mandatory inclusion of 
sun-safety training before deployment of FSPV workers 
should be considered both in training programs and OSH 
standards.
The successful adoption of sun-safety programs at the 
workplace depends on several internal, external, and other 
factors. The intervention model adopted for the “Sun 
Safety at Work Canada” program can be referred into 
when implementing such programs in the FSPV sector.84
Future scope includes the development of training pro­
grams with a focus on OSH for different types of solar PV 
projects since the contextual requirements are different. 
The authors also feel that universal OSH standards should 
be developed for the FSPV sector separately.
Existing Design Approaches in the Solar 
PV Industry
The outcomes of the review reveal that the majority of the 
research on floating solar PV projects is focusing on the 
design parameters related to efficiency, performance 
improvement, cost-effectiveness, the durability of the floa­
ters, and other aspects.59,63,65,68,72 Little focus has been 
given to the design interventions in the FSPV sector from 
the dimension of OSH of the workers who are the most 
vulnerable and exposed to a complex combination of risks 
except for one study which focuses on electrical safety.66 
The papers in this review reveal that most of the focus has 
been given to the OSH aspects of the small-scale roof-top 
solar PV projects and not so much to utility-scale land 
mounted or floating solar PV projects. The Oregon Solar 
Industries Association (OSEIA) has developed a detailed 
manual to ensure construction safety.85 The manual consists 
of ways in which occupational risks can be identified and 
removed or controlled if elimination is not possible and 
ways to recover from accidents. Although the manual can 
be beneficial during the construction phase, it does not offer 
any design solutions and is only restricted to roof-top solar 
installations. Similarly, the Nigerian Energy Support 
Programme (NESP) has developed a handbook that details 
the different aspects of workplace safety in small solar 
installations.86 However, design interventions as a strategic 
tool have not been considered. A group of researchers stu­
died the effects of developing design solutions for workers 
engaged in the installation of solar PV for small buildings. 
They collected contextual data from actual projects to iden­
tify safety risks and attributes of Prevention through Design 
(Pt D) of the solar roof-top projects such as roofing material, 
accessories, the slope of the roof, the layout of solar panels, 
the system of fall protection, lifting methods and other safety 
factors. They also interacted with contractors and finally 
developed a solar Pt D protocol aimed at reducing workplace 
risks.60 Hong64 focused on the importance of incorporating 
ergonomic design factors in the design of solar PV panels. 
He proposes the incorporation of functional design, interface 
design, color design, ergonomics factors, surface material, 
and structural elements in the final product design. Electrical 
safety is an important aspect of FSPV installations because 
of the proximity of electrical equipment to water and the 
interface with the workers. Bhang et al66 propose a design 
solution for underwater grounding for FSPV projects based 
on the lowest water temperature. Such design interventions 
are expected to ultimately protect workers against electro­
cution, especially when electrical risks are unseen. Balo and 
Şaǧbanşua69 insist that solar panels’ selection should con­
sider customer satisfaction, electrical, mechanical, financial, 
and environmental parameters. The learnings from these 
design approaches can be applied in the FSPV sector to 
plan appropriate ergonomics design interventions.
Design as a Strategy for Risk Mitigation
An important objective of design is to prevent deleterious 
effects and drudgery in the workplace through appropriate 
interventions. For example, occupational falls can be greatly 
reduced or prevented by aiding balance recovery through the 
design of footwear (to prevent falls on slippery floats), walk­
way handrails (to prevent falls in the water), and other aspects 
of task design.87 The design interventions must be contextual 
and address the risk factors in a manner that ensures 
a comfortable and safe work environment since every injury 
or accident comes at a high price for all stakeholders. Design 
intervention is an effective way of addressing these issues 
before the occupational risk factors become uncontrollable.
This review indicates several ergonomics design inter­
ventions for addressing the occupational risk factors in the 
installation and maintenance of floating solar photovoltaic 
projects. They include innovative tools, lowering of loads, 
redesigning workplace layouts, introducing job aids, auto­
mation, task rotation, training, OSH standards, job enlar­
gement, and changes in work organization/shift.

Jobs in the renewable energy industry fall in the category 
of “green jobs”.88 Schulte et al89 have argued that although 
such jobs are referred to as green jobs, the workers perform­
ing them are not necessarily safe as they are exposed to 
a host of occupational risks, some of which have been 
described earlier. They recommend adopting the strategy 
of “designing out the hazards” to address such issues. 
Hanson90 emphasized the need for workplace design and 
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to protect workers 
engaged in installing solar panels in hot climatic conditions. 
Designing out risks in green jobs is critically important by 
ideally involving the worker in risk assessment and the 
complete design process by considering physical, cognitive, 
and organizational factors. Figure 5 shows a suggested strat­
egy to implement design interventions in the FSPV sector. 
Stakeholders can use the template to plan and execute inter­
ventions using a participative approach. To ensure the sus­
tainability of the job, a tool consisting of 40 occupational 
health indicators for monitoring of green jobs in Portugal 
based on the framework “Health indicators of sustainable 
jobs” of the World Health Organization (WHO) can also be 
used in the FSPV sector.91
The review outcomes support the urgent need for inter­
ventions given the growing size of the FSPV sector and 
context-specific occupational risks associated with instal­
lation and maintenance. This study also highlights several 
research gaps/opportunities for addressing the risk factors 
from an ergonomics design perspective (Figure 4).
It is also proposed that OSH issues are closely linked to 
several SDGs of the UNDP. Therefore, sustainability 
initiatives should also address the safety and health con­
cerns of the workers engaged in the FSPV sector. 
Moreover, if the OSH issues are addressed, FSPV projects 
are expected to be the most preferred and affordable (by 
avoiding OSH costs) source of clean and sustainable 
energy within the solar PV industry.
Limitations of the Study
The online bibliographic databases considered for this 
scoping review were limited to Science Direct, Google 
Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus based on the study 
design. Another limitation is that only published papers in 
the English language were considered.
Conclusion
The present review focussed mainly on the emerging OSH 
issues in the installation and maintenance aspects of the 
floating solar PV projects. Within the solar PV industry, 
FSPV installations are new and evolving workplaces with 
a host of occupational risk factors that have not been 
adequately recognized and addressed. Immediate attention 
should be given to controlling these risk factors by the 
stakeholders before the workers start developing muscu­
loskeletal disorders, suffer from effects of solar radiation 
affecting the skin and eyes, heat illnesses, burn injuries, 
psychosocial problems, and other deleterious health con­
ditions. The current scoping review reveals some impor­
tant themes and future scope that need to be considered to 
achieve SDGs successfully. These include the following 
points:
a) FSPV projects are new workplaces with emerging 
occupational hazards (distinct from occupational risks in 
other solar PV installations). The impacts of these hazards 
are needed to be further investigated and addressed.
b) The prevailing occupational risks are diverse and 
may affect the workers individually or in combination (eg, 
carrying a heavy solar PV panel on an unstable floating 
platform in hot and humid temperatures).
c) This review has identified various research gaps that 
might be addressed by involving all the stakeholders through 
appropriate ergonomics design interventions (Figure 4).
d) There is a need for exploring the efficacy of differ­
ent interventions and their relationships/mediating roles 
with safety, productivity, and cost-effectiveness (Figure 4).
e) Further, there are opportunities for the development 
of universal training and global OSH standards (especially 
for electrical safety) specific to the floating solar PV 
sector.
The current paper is the first of its kind effort to review 
the emerging OSH issues in the FSPV sector where there 
are significant knowledge gaps and proposes future scope 
for ergonomics design solutions. These interventions are 
positively linked to the attainment of several SDGs and 
must be taken up for a sustainable FSPV sector. This 
review is intended to arouse interest among different sta­
keholders such as industrial designers, manufacturers, 
investors, project developers, energy suppliers, health and 
safety professionals, ergonomists, training entities, and 
policymakers to encourage/motivate them to contribute in 
their own ways to ensure sustainable development.
