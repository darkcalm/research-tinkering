ABSTRACT
Background: Servicing and maintaining wind turbines may expose wind turbine technicians
(wind techs) to musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) hazards. We aimed to characterise MSD hazard
exposures and identify work elements that should be prioritised for MSD prevention efforts.
Methods: A cross-sectional online survey methodology gathered data from 144 wind techs
based on a convenience, non-probability sampling approach. The survey was developed using
resources from the Ontario MSD Prevention Guideline, where cognitive interviewing yielded
wind tech specific modifications.
Results: Climbing was the most physically demanding task, followed by torqueing/tensioning
and manual materials handling (MMH). However, working in awkward and constrained postures
emerged as the task most likely to cause or aggravate discomfort.
Conclusions: Injecting ergonomic and human factors principles into wind turbine design should
be a high priority. Re-engineering tools like torque tensioning devices may reduce MSD hazard
exposures associated with tasks including torqueing/tensioning and MMH.
Practitioner Summary: We know little about musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) hazards associated
with green jobs. By surveying wind turbine technicians, we learned that MSD hazards exists,
and can be addressed by better considering human factors/ergonomics principles in the design
of wind turbines and the tools required for service and maintenance operations.

Introduction
Canada’s wind generation capacity has increased by
18 per cent every year for the past five years (Can WEA
n.d.), and new wind farm installations are being constructed at a fast pace. As a result, wind turbine service technicians (wind techs) are in high demand to
maintain a growing fleet of wind turbines (Can WEA
n.d.). Wind techs perform essential job tasks related to
the inspection, repair, replacement, and maintenance
of critical wind turbine elements including the hub,
blades, gearbox, yaw system, etc. (Milligan, O’Halloran,
and Tipton 2019). Wind techs can spend up to
60 hours per year, per turbine, performing annual
maintenance and servicing (Carroll, Mc Donald, and
Mc Millan 2016), and an additional 7.5 hours up to
52 hours or more per turbine when performing minor
repairs up to major replacements, respectively (Carroll,
Mc Donald, and Mc Millan 2016). While wind techs continue to support and maintain a growing fleet of wind
turbines, we know very little about how to protect
and maintain a growing workforce of wind techs.
Specifically, we know little about the musculoskeletal
disorder (MSD) hazards that wind techs face (Jia et al.
2016; Freiberg et al. 2018), nor do we understand the
physical health risks that may be related to those MSD
hazard exposures. Our limited knowledge of MSD hazards and potential health risks hinders our ability to
design
and
implement
proactive
MSD
prevention
efforts within the wind energy sector.
Understanding MSD hazard exposures and associated health risks are foundational requirements to

inform primary MSD prevention efforts. van der Beek
et al. (2017) suggest that interventions aimed at primary prevention have historically had limited success,
in part because of a lack of understanding aetiological
mechanisms. To improve the success of primary prevention interventions, van der Beek et al. (2017) suggest a 6-step framework for MSD prevention research
beginning by understanding the incidence and severity of MSD, followed by understanding the risk factors
for MSD. Consistent with this recommended best practice, the MSD prevention Guideline for Ontario (Centre
of
Research
Expertise
for
the
Prevention
of
Musculoskeletal
Disorders
(CRE-MSD)
n.d.,
Comprehensive Step-by-Step) also prescribes steps,
where hazard identification and risk assessment play
an early and central role in supporting longer-term
MSD prevention efforts. Emergent best practices (van
der Beek et al. 2017; Centre of Research Expertise for
the Prevention of Musculoskeletal Disorders (CRE-MSD)
n.d., Comprehensive Step-by-Step) further reinforce
the need to collect and describe data related to MSD
hazard exposures and health risks to inform efficacious
proactive MSD prevention efforts to protect the sustainability and viability of the wind tech workforce.
Several approaches exist to gather MSD hazard
exposure and physical health risk data within an ergonomics context. Consistent with the MSD Prevention
Guideline for Ontario (Centre of Research Expertise for
the Prevention of Musculoskeletal Disorders (CRE-MSD)
n.d.,
Comprehensive
Step-by-Step)
approach,
selfreport methods including staff feedback surveys and
worker discomfort surveys provide cost-effective and
reliable instruments. Similar to a job exposure matrix
(e.g. Evanoff et al. 2019), staff feedback surveys invite
respondents to indicate the presence of MSD hazards
such as ‘repeat the same movements or actions more
than a few times a minute for more than 30 minutes
at a time?’ or ‘lift, push, pull, or move heavy items?’,
using binary, yes/no responses. When respondents
indicate the presence of an exposure, they may provide additional context about the magnitude of exposure, or specific job tasks where that exposure was
present. The 1-year reproducibility of self-reported
exposure data is established (d’Errico et al. 2007), supporting its utility as a useful tool to gather MSD hazard
exposure
data.
Body
maps,
like
the
Nordic
Questionnaire (Kuorinka et al. 1987), provide methods
to gather respondents self-reported perception of pain
or discomfort in specific body locations and are advocated to support worker-oriented ergonomic intervention (Messing et al. 2008). Body maps and associated
visual analog scales or CR-10 exertion scales (Cameron
1996) can compliment MSD hazard data to begin elucidating sources of pain, discomfort, or high physical
exertion. While physical examination remains as the
gold standard, Nordic style body pain or discomfort
maps provide a valid approach for the surveillance
MSD symptoms (Descatha et al. 2007) pertaining to
physical risks.
Protecting green jobs, like wind turbine service
technician, by proactively addressing MSD hazards
remains as both a challenge and opportunity in green
ergonomics (Hanson 2013). As a first step to developing a comprehensive primary MSD prevention strategy, we need to understand hazard exposures and
risks. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify and describe MSD hazard exposures and physical
discomfort among wind techs using a cross-sectional
survey-based methodology. To support and inform
current ergonomics practice in the wind energy sector,
we aimed to answer the question: what job tasks
should be prioritised for proactive hazard identification and risk assessment? Equipped with a richer
understanding of MSD hazard exposures and symptoms, consistent with best practice guidelines (van der
Beek et al. 2017; Centre of Research Expertise for the
Prevention of Musculoskeletal Disorders (CRE-MSD)
n.d.,
Comprehensive
Step-by-Step),
we
can
delve
deeper into root causes and specific mechanisms to
inform the development of efficacious and effective
interventions
to
support
primary
MSD
prevention
within the wind energy sector.
Methodology
Study design and sample
A cross-sectional online survey methodology was used
to measure wind techs’ self-report task related pain,
discomfort and perceived exertion. The survey also
gathered wind techs’ feedback about potential MSD
hazards associated with specific job tasks and inquired
about
prospective
solutions
that
might
help
to
address those emergent hazards.
In the absence of registry of wind techs, a convenience, non-probability sampling method was used for
recruitment. Our recruitment strategy was informed by
the Tailored Design Method (Dillman, Smyth, and
Christian 2014) to maximise responses. Consistent with
the overarching goals of the Tailored Design Method,
we: developed a survey instrument that could be completed in a time efficient manner (i.e. minimise the
cost of participation); provided adequate incentives for
participation (i.e. offered a chance to win one of five
$100 gift cards); and, established trust with those

working as wind techs by using pre-survey messaging
to reaffirm the value and necessity of participation to
support
MSD
prevention
within
the
wind
energy sector.
To reach potential wind tech respondents, the
Canadian Wind Energy Association (Can WEA) distributed an e-mail with the survey link to its member
organisations (i.e. wind farm operations) on our behalf.
In turn, member organisations were asked to re-circulate the message to their employees. Because of our
recruitment approach, our sample is inclusive of wind
techs working for Canadian wind farm organisations
affiliated with Can WEA. In the future, the establishment of a registry of wind techs would permit the use
of more direct communication methods, enable a
more systematic and probabilistic sampling approach,
and permit the calculation of a true response rate.
Survey instrument design
The survey instrument was developed based on existing resources made available through the Ontario
MSD Prevention Guideline. Resources including the
Worker
Discomfort
Survey
(Centre
of
Research
Expertise
for
the
Prevention
of
Musculoskeletal
Disorders (CRE-MSD) n.d., Worker Discomfort Survey),
Perceived
Exertion
Survey
(Centre
of
Research

the
Prevention
of
Musculoskeletal
Disorders (CRE-MSD) n.d., Perceived Exertion Survey,)
and
Staff
Feedback

(Centre

Research

the
Prevention
of
Musculoskeletal
Disorders (CRE-MSD) n.d., Staff Feedback Survey) were
adapted to the wind energy sector and combined into
a single survey instrument, along with basic workforce
profile
and
demographics
questions
(e.g.
hours
worked/week, height, age, experience). We used a
cognitive
interviewing
approach
(Collins
2003)
to
adapt
the
Ontario
MSD
Prevention
Guideline
resources, as necessary, to ensure that wording and
language
were
consistent
with
the
context
and
expectations of wind techs. To complete the cognitive
interviewing process, a draft survey, inclusive of the
as-is questions and prompts within the resources, was
reviewed by a small group of five wind tech experts.
Where necessary, wording was adapted to include
examples
specific
to
the
wind
energy
sector.
Additionally, in some cases additional follow-up questions were added such as, ‘what is the wind turbine
megawatt class rating where you perform that task’ as
a follow-up to the as-is Staff Feedback Survey question,
‘What
is
the
most
physically
difficult
task
you do?’
The survey instrument was coded into Qualtrics
software (Seattle, Washington) and pilot tested to verify
that
all
questions
were
included,
properly
sequenced and that any skip patterns were correctly coded.
Data analysis and statistics
While many survey questions were posed in an closed
format, some probes invited open-ended responses.
For example, respondents were asked to identify their
top three most physically demanding tasks and also
to identify which tasks likely caused or aggravated
their discomfort. To analyse results from the above
questions, a team of two researchers reviewed the
complete list of open-text responses identifying six
emergent themes (Table 1). Individual responses for
related open-ended questions were then coded into
one of those six themes to support further descriptive analysis.
Descriptive statistics (i.e., means, standard deviations,
frequencies)
were
used
to
characterise
responses.
Additionally,
we
triangulated
responses
related to pain and discomfort, perceived exertion,
Table 1. Respondents listed physically demanding tasks (selected examples included) that were most demanding and also that
likely caused or aggravated their discomfort. We characterised those open-ended response data into six overarching categories
for additional analysis.

for
proactive
hazard
identification
and
risk assessment?’
Results
We received 144 unique responses, an approximate
response rate of 12% based on 1200 wind techs working in Canada at the time of our survey, as estimated
by Can WEA. As a result, we are 95% confident that
mean response data are within a ± 8% margin of error.
The median survey completion time was 22 minutes
(interquartile range of 15 to 33 minutes).
Demographics
The sample of wind techs responding to the survey
included 130 males, 5 females and 9 respondents who
preferred not to disclose their gender. The median age
of respondents was 32 ± 9 years old, (range 20–64 years
of age). Approximately half of the respondents had up
to 5 years of experience (47%), where the remainder
had five or more years of experience as a wind tech.
Self-report discomfort
In our survey of wind techs, 81% of respondents experienced some level of work-related discomfort in the
past year. Of those reporting some level of workrelated discomfort, over half responded ‘yes’ when
asked ‘Do you consider your discomfort to be a problem?’ Respondents indicated their perceived level of
discomfort across different regions of the body using
a 10-point scale (0 is no discomfort, 10 is worst discomfort experienced). Respondents indicated a moderate level of discomfort in nearly all body areas and
reported the greatest discomfort in the knees, shoulders and back (Figure 1).
Respondents were also asked to indicate the tasks
or activities that likely caused or aggravated their discomfort. We classified perceived problematic tasks and
activities, as indicated by wind techs, into the same
categories that were used to classify heavy physically
demanding tasks (Table 1). Task and activities constrained to require awkward postures were most frequently identified as the likely cause or aggravating
factor regarding perceived discomfort (Figure 2).
High physical demand tasks and ergonomic
hazard exposures
Respondents were asked to identify their top three
most physically demanding tasks. For each physically
demanding task, respondents were asked to indicate
how often they perform the task (hours per month), in
what area of the turbine they perform the task, and
the megawatt class rating of the turbine where they
perform that task. Open-ended responses were coded
into one of six themes (refer to Table 1).
Climbing was identified as the most or second
most physically demanding task, more than any other A bar graph plotting the median rating of perceived exertion scores for each body region. Median scores ranged from 5 to 3 on a 10-point scale where median pain scores were highest for the right shoulder and knee.
Figure 1. Median perceived discomfort score (0 low to 10 high) experienced by wind turbine technicians stratified by body
region. Median values were calculated from all responses, inclusive of respondents who may have scored their discomfort as zero
for a given body region. Error bars represent boundaries of lower and upper quartiles. Note that a low back category was unintentionally omitted from the body part regions when coding the body map into the Qualtrics survey software.

demand (Figure 3). On average, respondents reported
spending 14 (range 1-40þ) hours per month climbing.
Additionally, when climbing was identified a most
physically demanding task, 50% of cases referenced
climbing within the inside-up tower and 51% of cases
were related to climbing with a 1-2 MW class turbine.
Torqueing/tensioning and manual materials handling
followed climbing as the most physically demanding
tasks (Figure 3). On average, respondents reported
spending 16 and 17 hours per month torqueing/tensioning and performing manual materials handling,
respectively. When torqueing/tensioning was identified, 62% of cases referred to work in the inside-up
tower of the turbine. When manual material handling
was identified, 52% of cases referred to work in the
nacelle. Respondents spent the most time, on average,
completing
job
tasks
requiring
postural
demands
(average of 23 hours per month).
Respondents
also
identified
their
frequency
of
exposure to ergonomic hazards. Over 50% of respondents reported exposure to each MSD hazard (Figure 4)
on a daily basis. Exposures including working in a A histogram plotting the frequency of responses regarding tasks that caused or aggravated pain and discomfort at work. Task categories included changing components, torque / tensioning, manual materials handling, climbing, postural demands, and an other category. Postural discomfort was most frequently identified as the task that caused discomfort and torque / tensioning and postural demands were most frequently identified as tasks that aggravate pain.

tight or restricted space, bending/twisting at the waist,
bending wrists up/down frequently and working with
arms above the shoulder were experienced daily for
most respondents (Figure 4).
Respondents also indicated their average duration of
exposure to each MSD hazard. When considering exposures including reaching behind the body, bending/
twisting at the waist and lifting while bending or twisting, responses were distributed towards lower durations
(Figure
5).
Conversely,
when
considering
exposures
including bending wrists up/down frequently, working
with arms above the shoulder and working in a tight or

Possible MSD hazards included working in a tight space, bending / twisting at the waist, bending wrists up / down frequently, working with arms above the shoulder, reaching behind the body, and lifting while bending or twisting. While most wind techs reported that reaching behind the body was typically performed for a duration up to 10 minutes, wind techs more frequently responded to indicate that d exposures to working with arms above the shoulder or working in tight or restricted space were performed for durations of 30 minutes to 1 hour, 1-2 hours or 2-3 hours at a time.

Lifting, pushing, pulling, and moving heavy objects
are also known MSD hazards. One in three respondents indicated lifting objects weighing more than
30 kg on their own (Figure 6 – left pane). Lifting in
teams of two, one in three respondents indicated lifting more the 60 kg (Figure 6 – right pane).
Wind techs lift, push, pull, and move many different
objects. When asked to list the heaviest item, respondents included a range of objects that were classified
into five categories: tool bags/service kits, parts/components,
equipment/tools,
motors/fans,
and
other/
undisclosed. Tool bags/service kits, parts/components,
and equipment/tools were most often selected as the
heaviest items (Figure 7).
Respondents were asked to indicate their level of
concern about suffering an injury as a result of their
exposures to MSD hazards. Over 50% of respondents
indicated that they were very concerned, or concerned
about awkward postures, heavy lifting and repetition
(Figure 8).
Opportunities and ideas for improvement
To
identify
what
wind
techs’
believed
could
be
improved we invited them to share their top three
suggested improvements. Over 50% of respondents
changes related to space, clearance or access within
their top three suggested improvements (Figure 9).
This finding corroborates the findings reported in
Figure 8 where respondents indicated the greatest
amount
of
concern
with
awkward
postures
and,
Figure 2, identifying postural demands as the mostly
likely
cause
or
aggravating
factor
influencing
discomfort. A complete list of anonymized survey
responses is provided as an Supplementary Appendix.
Discussion
This study provides novel findings that inform a more
comprehensive description of wind techs MSD hazard
exposures and physical discomforts. In their scoping
review,
Freiberg
et
al.
(2018)
noted
that
health
research in the wind turbine sector has focussed primarily on noise related outcomes, delivering a strong
call-to-action for more MSD related research to better
understand hazards and risks to wind energy sectors
workers. Despite that call-to-action, a knowledge gap
still persists. Our only insights about ergonomic hazard exposures come from a survey of wind techs
focussing specifically on low back pain (Jia et al.
2016). Based on results from the Washington State
Ergonomics Tool, which was embedded in their survey, lifting objects weighing more than 4.5 kg twice
per minute or more, was identified as a workplace factor associated with low back pain prevalence (Jia
et al. 2016). Our results compliment and extend findings by Jia et al. (2016). By broadening the focus to
pain and discomfort at any body region, and by providing wind techs with more freedom to self-identify
tasks that they deem to be problematic we provided
workers with a stronger voice in the identification of
MSD hazards process (Messing 2014). In addition to
reaffirming MSD hazard exposures related to lifting
(Jia et al. 2016), our findings also reinforce the need
to consider workspace layout and design (related to
space restrictions and awkward postures), torqueing/
tensioning tasks, and ladder climbing requirements to This figure has two panes. Each pane displays a histogram plotting the frequency of responses regarding the maximum weight lifted. The left pane displays results for the maximum weight lifted alone, where most wind techs responded by selecting the categories of more than 30 kg, or 20-25 kg. The right pane displays results for the maximum weight lifted as a team, where most wind techs responded by selecting the categories of more than 60 kg, or 40-50 kg.

maximise the benefits of emergent proactive ergonomics programs for wind techs.
Respondents self-reported discomfort scores provide evidence that MSD prevention efforts to support
wind techs should be a high priority. Although not
indicative of specific pathology, self-reported discomfort that is above 2on a 0-10 scale may be a useful
predictor of future musculoskeletal pain (Hamberg-van
Reenen et al. 2008). Hamberg-van Reenen et al. (2008)
demonstrated that individuals reporting body discomfort were more likely to suffer future back, neck and
shoulder
pain
as
measured
using
a
Nordic
Questionnaire, consistent with similar results reported
by Werner et al. (2005). In our survey of wind techs,
81% of respondents experienced work-related discomfort in the past year, where the median values for
respective body regions ranged from 3 to 5, and
where the interquartile range (25th–75th) ranged from
1 to 7 on a 10-point scale. The magnitude of median
responses
is
likely
important,
considering
that
respondents were given the anchors of no discomfort
(‘0’) and worst discomfort ever (‘10’). While difficult to
directly comment on an individual’s perception of discomfort, or whether respondents may have misinterpreted
between
pain
and
discomfort,

(e.g. knees, back, shoulders), using the aforementioned
anchors, raises some cause for concern. Considering
the magnitude of median responses, the results of
Hamberg-van Reenen et al. (2008), and that over 50%
of those reporting discomfort feel that their discomfort is a problem, the high prevalence of discomfort
reporting among wind techs may foreshadow a significant future MSD problem, if left unchecked.
While this study was not designed to specifically
quantify causal factors, results highlight prospective
MSD hazards that should be more fulsomely investigated and controlled where necessary. When asked to
identify their top three physically demanding tasks,
wind techs’ responses were rank-ordered as (1) climbing, (2) torqueing/tensioning, and (3) manual materials
handling. However, when juxtaposed against responses
related to wind techs’ perceived level of concern for
specific MSD hazards and wind techs’ indication of tasks
that have likely caused or aggravated their discomfort,
postural demands/awkward postures stood out more so
than other factors. For this reason, further investigation
and intervention to address workspace layout issues is
warranted as a high priority.
Survey responses triangulate to support that turbine
workspace layout should be a key focal point within a
multi-pronged MSD prevention program for wind techs.
Wind techs noted that they spend considerable time in
tight or restricted spaces, listed awkward postures as
the most ‘very concerning’ ergonomic hazard, most
often identified postural demands as a causal or aggravating factor in their perceived discomfort, and lastly
listed space/clearance/access as their top ‘preferred
change’. However, workspace layout is primarily driven
by wind turbine design. Considering the results of our
survey, it is likely important that human factors/
ergonomics (HFE) principles are more prominently considered within the design of wind turbines. For reference,
the
Canadian
Standards
Association
(CSA)
standard Z1004-12 (Canadian Standards Association
(CSA) 2012) reaffirms the importance of considering
ergonomics in design, drawing attention specifically to
the importance of considering how design will impact
on operation and maintenance. This includes designing
to mitigate MSD hazard exposures to those responsible
for performing operations and maintenance, supporting
previous claims by Hanson and Thatcher (2019) who
also nicely summarise the need for enhanced consideration of HFE principles into design, noting specific
examples related to the greasing points, which can
effect both posture and repetition based physical
demands.
While
American
Society
of
Mechanical
Engineers (ASME) standards including a forthcoming
update to ASME section 17.8 (Donoghue, 2016) regarding elevators and wind turbines are slowly becoming
more inclusive of HFE principles, it is important that
such principles are also considered and applied to the
design of the interior workspace and layout of the wind
turbine, particularly the nacelle. Ensuring the inclusion
of HFE professionals on technical standards committees
may provide a viable means to ensure that HFE considerations are more fulsomely considered.
Novel wind turbine designs that better consider the
workspace layout needs of wind techs who must
maintain the safe operation of those turbines is paramount; however, considering MSD prevention related
to aspects of work including climbing, torqueing/tensioning, and manual materials handling is also important.

based on off-shore wind techs (Milligan, O’Halloran,
and Tipton 2019). The only differences between the
physically demanding tasks identified by on-shore
wind techs in our study and off-shore wind techs, as
reported on by Milligan, O’Halloran, and Tipton (2019)
was the addition of ‘transferring from a vessel to the
turbine’ and ‘hauling a casualty up the turbine’ tasks.
This may not be surprising since those additional tasks
are indeed specific to off-shore wind turbine maintenance. The overlapping findings regarding the physicality of tasks including climbing, torqueing/tensioning,
and manual materials handling reinforce the importance of focussing attention to these activities when
considering MSD prevention programs for wind techs.
Climbing was identified as the most physically
demanding task by wind techs responding to our survey. Where some turbines have elevator systems (typically newer or larger turbines), many older or smaller
turbines (i.e. 1-2 MW class turbines) still require ladder
climbing to navigate within the turbine. With reference to off-shore turbines, wind techs may climb distances ranging from 80 m to 120 m, multiple times per
day (Milligan, O’Halloran, and Tipton 2019), at rates
between
30
and
67
rungs
per
minute
(Milligan,
O’Halloran, and Tipton 2020). As a result, following a
120 m climb, Milligan, O’Halloran, and Tipton (2020)
observed significant decreases in grip strength and
endurance post-climb in addition to altered climbing
movements, when faced with multiple climbs. These
changes
were
attributed
to
fatigue
(Milligan,
O’Halloran, and Tipton 2020). With respect to a potential MSD prevention approach, control via substitution
of ladders with elevators (where feasible) would likely
help mitigate the physical demands of climbing; however, this intervention will likely be most useful in
smaller or older turbines that may not have climb
assist functionality. Additionally, Milligan, O’Halloran,
and Tipton (2020) provide evidence that experienced
wind techs may climb with more energetically optimised strategies, suggesting that early training interventions as an administrative control may also be
efficacious. Emerging evidence also highlights the
potential for ‘climb assist’ technologies to serve as
engineering controls (Barron et al. 2017), to decrease
the physicality associated with climbing.
Wind techs are required to torque and tension
bolts when maintaining or replacing parts within the
turbine. Milligan, O’Halloran, and Tipton (2019) report
that off-shore wind techs spend about 20% of their
work
time
on
torqueing
and
tensioning
which
includes applying torque to (un)secure bolts, often in
awkward postures, and also while handling heavy
equipment including a tension head device that can
weight up to 19 kg. Those results overlap with our survey findings, where more than 50% of our wind tech
respondents spent more than 30 minutes at a time
exposed to awkward posture related MSD hazards
including bending wrists up/down frequently and
working with arms above the shoulder, most likely
while (un)torqueing bolts. As a result, it was not surprising to see many respondents identify tools and
equipment as an opportunity for improvement, where
many specifically identified the need for lighter tensioning tools. These data provide evidence that wind
techs perform torqueing and tensioning tasks that
expose them to MSD hazards. It is important to verify
if and when those exposures exceed relevant threshold values in order to prioritise and maximise MSD
prevention program efforts.
Manual materials handling and specifically lifting
has long been associated with MSD. It was surprising
that nearly 50% of wind tech respondents lifted
objects in excess of 25 kg on their own, although
many wind farms have implemented safe lifting policies that require a team approach for lifts greater than
20 kg.
However,
our
results
were
consistent
with
Milligan, O’Halloran, and Tipton (2019) who reported
that manual handling of loads up to 27 kg in a single
person lift was a common physically demanding task.
When considering two-handed lifting, under ideal conditions (good grip, symmetrical lift, low frequency,
etc.), the National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health (NIOSH) suggests a maximum recommended weight limit of 23 kg (Waters et al. 1993).
Given the workspace layout in the turbine, we speculate that wind techs are exposed to conditions that
are likely far from ideal, such that recommended
weight limits within the turbine would likely be lower.
Intervening on manual materials handling exposures,
including
lifting,
likely
requires
a
multi-faceted
approach
targeting
substitution
and
engineering
related controls, since administrative controls in the
form of lift education have shown limited efficacy in
the prevention of MSD (Denis et al. 2019). Specifically,
tool bags/service kits were most frequently identified
as the ‘heaviest’ object moved. This points to a need
for interventions and advances that can reduce the
weight of tensioning tools. Reducing tool weights
would likely benefit both in terms of reducing torqueing and tensioning demands, and also reducing the
physical demands of manual materials handling.
Our sample only included data from five females,
accounting for less then 5% of our sample, where it is
important to consider sex/gender as it can play a

critical role in the development of MSD (C^ote, 2016).
Few identified female responses could suggest that
our sample is unrepresentative of the female wind
tech
experience;
however,
a
report
prepared
by
Electricity
Human
Resources
Canada
for
Natural
Resources Canada suggests that women only make up
20–25% of the clean energy workforce, and only up to
11% of the occupational group defined as technician/
technologist
(Electricity
Human
Resources
Canada,
2017). Based on the available evidence, our data may
modestly underestimate the female experience, but
perhaps more importantly, our data reinforce the sex/
gender gap within the wind technician workforce.
While future work should explore if and how MSD
exposures and risks may differ as a function of sex/
gender among wind techs, it may also prove useful to
probe possible systemic barriers that may be influencing the inclusion of females as wind techs. Issues like
the perception of a traditional male-dominated industry and workplace culture (perhaps related to the
heavy physical demands) noted by the Electricity
Human Resources Canada report (2017), may serve as
barriers to address when aiming to create a more
inclusive workforce.
These data provide important and necessary evidence about the self-report discomfort and MSD hazard exposures that wind techs face. However, it is
important to highlight a few limitations that should
inform the interpretation of these findings. As noted
above, we were not able to obtain a registry of wind
techs, which limited our ability to apply a more rigorous sampling strategy and to calculate a true response
rate. However, based on an estimate of 1,200 wind
techs in Canada, our response rate was approximately
12%, which is low. We attribute the low response rate,
in part, to our recruitment strategy where messaging
was circulated from Can WEA, to wind farm operations
to be forwarded on to wind techs directly. Despite our
efforts to pre-message the survey, and to provide
transparency about the intentions of the survey, anecdotally, we understand that some wind farms may
have elected not to forward the message on to their
wind tech work force. This would have limited both
our sample size and the likely number of respondents.
Alternatively, it is possible that those without access
to appropriate technology (i.e. a laptop or tablet) or
those who may be less confident writers (as necessary
to
respond
to
open-ended
questions)
may
have
passed on the opportunity to participate, which again
could be a factor that may partially explain our low
sample size. Considering that we did not have a registry, we were unable to identify and follow-up with
non-responders to quantify potential non-response
bias. It is possible that only those with significant concerns responded to our survey, which would inflate
findings related to perceived pain and discomfort.
However, in the absence of insights from non-responders, the potential for non-response bias remains
as a limitation. It is also important to acknowledge
that our results are based on maintenance and operations requirements performed by wind tech in Canada
to support on-shore wind turbine operations. While
physically demanding tasks are similar between onshore (our study) and off-shore (Milligan, O’Halloran,
and Tipton 2019) wind techs, important situational
and environmental factors likely persist that could
influence MSD prevention strategy implementation at
a system level. As a result, these data should not be
used to directly inform MSD prevention strategies for
off-shore wind turbine operations.
Conclusions
These data represent the first comprehensive survey
of perceived discomfort and self-reported MSD hazard
exposures among wind techs working to service and
maintain an ever growing fleet of wind turbines. While
evidence indicates that climbing may be the most
physically demanding task that wind techs face, the
constrained work spaces and layout inside the wind
turbine may be the most problematic from an MSD
hazard exposure perspective. As a result, these data
provide strong evidence that HFE principles should be
more robustly considered within the design of wind
turbines.
Notwithstanding
the
importance
of
proactively addressing wind turbine design, survey results
also indicate opportunities to further investigate and
control MSD hazards associated with climbing, torqueing/tensioning and manual materials handling. Future
endeavours focussing on the re-design and re-engineering of tools including torque tensioning devices
would serve to reduce MSD exposures associated with
both torqueing/tensioning and manual materials handling, and were strongly advocated for by responding
wind techs. The need for a capable workforce of wind
techs continues to grow around the world. It is
imperative that we focus our efforts on monitoring
and preventing MSD hazard exposures to wind techs
to maintain the viability of the workforce over the
long term.
