Abstract The renewable energy industry is seeing exponential growth in India.
Among the many clean energy sources, ﬂoating solar PV (FPV) projects are being
preferred because of its many advantages. The installation and maintenance of FPV
panels are generally been executed by an informal and inexperienced/semi-skilled
workforce who are exposed to the emerging challenges, which may lead to compromising of occupational safety and health (OSH) aspects. To explore the ground
scenario, ﬁeld surveys were carried out to study the OSH scenario which revealed
that the workers are highly exposed to different occupational hazards during installation and maintenance of FPV panels due to heavy load handling, awkward postures,
inappropriate tools, lack of safety measures against the harsh working environment
(hot Sun, electrocution, drowning, etc.), lack of speciﬁc training/skill-development,
etc. Project managers agreed that immediate attention is required for the safety and
better occupational health of the workers and felt the need for protecting the workers
from the hazards especially through design interventions. This study is a maiden
effort in understanding the OSH aspects in the emerging FPV sector in India and
establishes an information gap, which is proposed to be addressed through suitable
ergonomics design solutions.

Introduction
The power of the Sun is virtually inﬁnite. Only 30 min of solar radiation falling on
Earth can meet the annual energy demand of the world [1]. To tap this source of clean
energy, countries across the world are promoting different kinds of solar PV installations.Suchsources of energyarealsodemand-drivenas concerns over climatechange
and sustainability are taking precedent. The growth of renewable energy in India has

resulted from global and national policy developments (Fig. 21.1), decreasing tariffs
of solar PV projects, and the vast availability of solar irradiation and potential in
India most of the year [2]. In the last decade, solar PV installations in India have
registered higher growth than other renewable sources of energy (Fig. 21.2). Utilityscale ground-mounted solar PV projects require large-scale land acquisition, which
is a sensitive socio-economic issue. These circumstances have pushed stakeholders
to explore other types of solar PV projects that are land neutral.
Globally, ﬂoating solar PV (FPV) is fast emerging as a viable option where water
bodies are available. In 2007, the ﬁrst ﬂoating solar project (175 k Wp) in the world
was installed by SPG Solar of Novato, California, and Thompson Technologies
Industries (TTi), at Far Niente Winery in Napa Valley, California [3], and the ﬁrst
FPV project in India was installed in Kolkata, India. A study has estimated that the
quantum of water surface available for FPV installation in India is 18,000 km2, with

a maximum potential of 280 GW [4] with the state of Maharashtra having the largest
number of reservoirs, followed by states of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, indicating
a vast potential. At the beginning of 2019, the global installed capacity of FPV stood
at 1314 MW, and the global potential is estimated at 400 GWp [5].
21.2
Background and Need for the Study
FPV sites are new workplaces. Installation and maintenance involve new technology,
new tools, new hazards, and new environments. These circumstances present new
challenges to the workers engaged in such projects. Any work that is beyond the
capabilities of the worker is likely to lead to serious safety and health hazards. The
hazards primarily arise from the various mismatches in the interface at the workplace.
The workplace transition and emergence of new hazards are represented in Fig. 21.3.
The mismatches may involve physical, cognitive, and organizational factors.
Moreover, if untrained and unprotected workers are exposed to an unknown and
uncertain work role or environment, the occurrence of occupational diseases becomes
high. The solar PV industry in India is growing fast, and this entails that a large
and temporary workforce will be engaged in this sector, exposing a larger worker
population to emerging hazards. An estimate of the International Renewable Energy
Agency (IRENA) says that globally 11.7 million people will be engaged in the solar
PV industry by 2030 with an installed capacity of 2840 GW [6].
As is evident from Fig. 21.3, there are several mismatches between the worker
and different components of a typical renewable energy workplace, which are FPV
projects in this case. The workers are mostly engaged in a non-standard work arrangement and are likely to be exposed to several psychosocial hazards. These mismatches

are potential situations for the causation of several occupational diseases. An important objective of design is to provide a solution to a problem. Therefore, design
solutions can be used to resolve these mismatches by controlling the risk factors and
matching the interfaces with the worker to create a safe and comfortable work environment. FPV projects have a bright future in India. Thus, it is essential to address
these issues through design for safety approach at the nascent stage, so that present
and future workers can be protected.
21.3
Research Questions, Aims, and Objectives
The study began by formulating some research questions. They are (a) what are the
occupational hazards that workers are exposed to during the installation and maintenance of ﬂoating solar PV projects? and (b) what context-speciﬁc tools, equipment,
or other workplace aspects can be designed (or redesigned) to control the hazards
for which solutions do not exist?
The present study investigates the ground scenario of OSH aspects of the FPV
workforce and thereafter checking the possibility of improvement of OSH through
innovative design interventions. The objectives are as follows:
• To identify the sources of hazards (occupational, environmental, psychosocial, skill gaps, etc.) regarding the workers engaged in FPV installation and
maintenance.
• To study the existing occupational safety and health measures for the FPV sector.
• To identify the possibilities of design interventions from the OSH perspective.
21.4
Methodology
A review of the literature was carried out to identify existing research in the solar
PV industry with emphasis on the FPV sector, followed by developing an OSH
questionnaire to carry out the ﬁeld studies.

as chemical (toxic gases), thermal, and physical hazards [7] associated with the manufacturing of photovoltaic energy systems. Studies showed that with large-scale solar
PVincreasinginnumber,thefocusshiftedtostudyingthehazardsrelatedtotheinstallation of PV systems. These include falls, injury from objects, electric shock, trafﬁc
accidents, thermal burns, awkward postures, handling heavy loads, and wounds [8].
Such hazards can lead to work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs), which
can cause permanent damage to the workers’ health. Fire hazards were identiﬁed
in grid-connected PV systems [9]. Sources of health effects on workers/employees
during PV system installation and maintenance includes heat, non-ionizing radiation,
electricity, ﬂora, and hailstorms [10]. The workers are also exposed to hazards from
various components of the PV system such as solar panels, batteries, and inverters
[11].
To understand the existing design interventions for ensuring the OSH of the
workers in the solar PV industry (with emphasis on ﬂoating solar), literature was
reviewed. Most of the papers concentrated on design considerations related to PV
system design in terms of cost and efﬁciency, ecological design of solar PV system,
roof design for PV system efﬁciency, aesthetic impact, and designing for consumer
preference for residential solar panels [10, 12–15]. Only three studies were found
which used a design approach for ensuring the safety and health of the workers.
One study reports on the ﬂoating solar PV system’s grounding design, thus ensuring
electrical safety [16]. Another research suggests the use of multiple inverters (small)
to prevent ﬁre hazard [9]. A comprehensive OSH study on the roof-top solar installations was carried by a group of researchers who have used the prevention through
design (Pt D) approach to ensure workers’ safety by developing a Pt D protocol [17].
No studies on training/skill up-gradation, psychosocial aspects, or design interventions speciﬁc to the ﬂoating solar PV sector were found. This establishes a knowledge
gap that this present paper attempts to explore.
Questionnaire development for the study: A literature survey was carried out
to explore the existence of OSH related questionnaires speciﬁc to the solar PV
industry/FPV sector. Only one OSH checklist on roof-top solar was found [18].
Drawing inferences from the OSH checklist on roof-top solar, views of the project
managers, and observations during the ﬁeld studies, a questionnaire was constructed.
The questionnaire contains eight sections, namely (a) general information about location, type, and size of the project, type and skill level of workers, etc.; (b) training,
safety, and work organization aspects; (c) hazards of working on water, slips, trips,
falls, etc.; (d) use of personal-protective equipment (PPE); (e) electricity-related
hazards; (f) hazards that may lead to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs); (g) speciﬁc
sources of OSH hazards, and (h) suggestions for design/redesign of FPV system
components. Photographs were taken of the installation process to understand the
workﬂow and functioning of a ﬂoating solar PV system and the workers’ interface.
The study included an analysis of the workﬂow; a survey of the tools and techniques used, and identiﬁcation of occupational hazards faced by the workers (n =
22) using observational methods and unstructured questionnaire seeking views of
the project managers (n = 4) engaged in the installation and maintenance of two

Case Studies
To understand the OSH scenario of the FPV projects in India, two sites where the
installation was underway were visited. The ﬁrst site was a 25 k W FPV project at
Mejia Thermal Power Station of Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) in the state of
West Bengal, and the second site was a 1 MW FPV installation at the Kawas Gasbased Power Station of National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) in the state of
Gujarat. An overview of the two locations is given in Table 21.1.
21.6
Results
The project managers completed the questionnaires related to the two sites using
online software during the period September–October 2019. The responses are
summarized in Table 21.2.

Other Inputs from Project Managers and General
Observations
• The hazards of workers engaged in FPV projects are different from those of
other types of solar PV projects. The additional hazards include unstable ﬂoaters
workingon/nearthewater.Theavoidanceofusingslipperyshoeswasemphasized.
• Sometimes workers are casual with the use of PPE, which are monitored and
corrected by supervisors. Standardized equipment and items for ﬂoating solar
projects will help in interchangeability. Need for standards for work procedure,
skill sets, etc.
• Site conditions not conducive to the use of mechanized material handling equipment. Instability of ﬂoating platforms during strong winds. Possibilities of
sunstroke, dehydration, and other heat illnesses.
• A requirement of an OSH checklist and design standards. Training and motivation
of workers for skill development, safety consciousness, and alertness during work.
• Workers are exposed to a work environment where both electricity and water are
present.
The ﬁeld surveys revealed that the workers are highly exposed to different occupational hazards (Fig. 21.4) during installation and maintenance of FPV panels. The
hazards arise due to heavy load handling, awkward posture, inappropriate tools, lack
of safety measures against the harsh working environment (hot Sun, glare, electrocution, drowning, etc.), lack of context-speciﬁc training/skill-development, etc. It

was also noticed that the slippery and unstable working surfaces and unavailability
of appropriate tools presented unique challenges for the workers engaged in FPV
projects, which are different from other traditional workplaces. Project managers
agreed that immediate attention is required for the safety and better occupational
health of the workers. They also suggested the need for design/redesign of several
aspects from the OSH perspective.
21.7
Discussion and Conclusion
This exploratory study revealed that FPV workers face multifarious OSH hazards on
both land and water. The hazards mainly arise due to the mismatches between the
workers and FPV system components. The study was designed in such a way so as
to collect views of project managers on OSH hazards and their views on the need
for addressing them through design interventions in speciﬁc areas. The results of the
case studies were compared to existing literature available wrt design interventions
in the FPV sector (Sect. 21.4.1) from an OSH standpoint, which elicited several
research gaps. The identiﬁed gaps for design/redesign for ensuring OSH include
(a) scaffolds around the walkways: (b) walkway platforms; (c) solar panels; (d)
ﬂoaters/pontoons; (e) PPE; (f) tools; (g) shoes, and (h) work methods. Apart from
this, design interventions toward ensuring training/skilling needs, protecting workers
from psychosocial hazards and environmental factors can also be explored.
The protection of the environment is an important human goal, and tomorrow’s
energy needs are likely to be completely met by clean energy sources. At the same
time, the protection of the workers in the renewable energy industries must also be
an important priority. Design can serve as a powerful tool to attain this objective. The
preliminary ﬁeld surveys were intended for “problem deﬁning” [19] from the OSH
dimension in the FPV sector in the Indian context. The hazards in ﬂoating solar PV
projects are different from other kinds of solar PV installations. One project manager
suggested that “Floating Solar Technology, still in an evolving stage, needs speciﬁc
design of equipment, tools, and accessories suitable for Floating installation.” These
ﬁndings call for a particular focus on designing different workplace aspects, so that
workers have a safe and comfortable work experience. This study has identiﬁed
some possible design interventions in that direction. Future studies include a detailed
analysis of the speciﬁc occupational hazards using ergonomic assessments and the
development of sustainable design solutions from a human-centered design (HCD)
perspective. This paper’s novelty is that this is a maiden study to explore the OSH
scenario of these new workplaces and identify opportunities for design interventions.

Limitations of the Study
The present exploratory study was based on a small sample size of workers (n = 22)
and project managers (n = 4) from only two sites limited to the Indian population.
This is because very few sites are available for investigation in this emerging sector.
