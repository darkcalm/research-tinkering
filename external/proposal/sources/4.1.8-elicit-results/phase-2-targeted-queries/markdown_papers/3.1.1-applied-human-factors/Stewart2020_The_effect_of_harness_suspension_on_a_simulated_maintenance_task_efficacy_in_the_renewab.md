Abstract 
 
Building, bridge or wind turbine maintenance requires manual dexterity tasks by a 
specialist rope-access trained workforce via two principal means: harness suspension 
of individual workers from above, or deployment of a suspended platform or cradle 
from which workers access the structure to be maintained. Currently no published 
research compares accuracy and efficiency of simulated maintenance tasks between 
these modalities. This study investigated manual dexterity task performance of peg 
placement and shape delineation in seated, standing and suspended environments in 
16 healthy controls and 26 professional rope-access trained individuals. Both seated 
and standing assessments were superior to those suspended, and height of 
suspension, total mass and years of experience had no influence on the task outcome. 
These findings suggest that, where feasible, cradle suspension mechanisms which 
permit standing maintenance are favourable in terms of task efficacy and where 
feasible, should be considered for deployment in wind energy and other engineering 
applications.

1. Introduction 
 
Global energy production is increasingly relying on renewable sources, in particular 
onshore and offshore wind technologies. In a burgeoning sector, wind turbines have 
proliferated since their introduction in the early 1990s and typically have a lifespan of 
about 25 years (Kolios & Martínez Luengo, 2016). After their installation, these 
turbines require regular scheduled maintenance in order to maintain efficient power

generation capability. For example, mechanical maintenance may require inspection, 
adjustment and replacement of bearings and gearing mechanism housed in the 
nacelle housing beside the hub. In addition, wind turbines must be maintained to 
protect against environmental degradation. Erosion of the exposed surfaces of the 
structure result from natural processes such as ultraviolet light, ice, lighting strike, 
and especially micro-pitting on surfaces result from water contact (Offshore 
Renewables Energy Catapult, 2018). In particular, this is an issue for the turbine 
blades themselves which experience surface degradation, predominantly in the 
region of tip where the velocity of impact with water droplets is greatest. The 
resulting surface degradation substantially reduces blade efficiency in generating 
power and occasionally results in blade failure and breakage which significantly 
increases operational expenditure. While regular planned maintenance can maximise 
the chances of a turbine fulfilling its life expectancy, there is a buoyant market for 
retro-fitting components have the potential to extend the working life well beyond 
this timespan (Wind Prospect, 2018). 
 
Blade maintenance of offshore wind turbines typifies many harness suspension tasks. 
This involves inspecting the entirety of a wind turbine blade surface in situ. Damaged 
areas (occurring as a result of factors such as water erosion, lightning, ultraviolet 
degradation and algal growth) are delineated and subsequently systematically 
ground, filled and cured to preserve a smooth and efficient shape. This work is 
traditionally carried out by specialist rope-access technicians in a process which 
becomes increasingly necessary as a turbine ages. The Industrial Rope Access Trade 
Association (IRATA) defines ‘rope access’ as “a form of work positioning where the 
person is suspended by means of personal fall Prevention equipment (rope, harness 
etc.) used in tension”. This secure suspension in tension defines what is referred to 
as ‘harness suspension’ in this study which included, like industrial contexts, a 
secondary safety system connected to the individual. 
 
Like similar rope access applications, blade maintenance can be undertaken via two 
principal means – by harness suspension from an anchor point above or via a cradle 
and habitat mechanism on which the engineer stands, which accesses the blade. The 
harness suspension method using individual rope access engineers benefits from 
more rapid deployment and egress in the event of adverse weather conditions. Its 
principal disadvantages centre on the potential threat to circulation, orthostatic 
syncope (Adisesh et al., 2011) and consequent suspension trauma, which is potentially 
fatal (Lee & Porter, 2007). While modern safety harnesses and protocols have 
lowered the risk of these to minimal levels, they may not have been eliminated 
entirely, although the poorer upper extremity musculoskeletal health of the 
maintenance engineers relative to controls may be imposed by work tasks and not 
the access technique involving full body harness suspension (Vikne et al., 2015). 
 
Harness-suspended engineers must also overcome the challenge of generating 
purchase when using tools against a vertical surface. To avoid reactive forces pushing 
them away from the blade surface they require stabilisation via tethering and incur 
additional muscular effort when exerting high forces. By contrast, a cradle and habitat 
approach, is safer for individuals in terms of health, but is considerably more of an

engineering challenge to achieve in practice. Cradle devices large enough to 
encapsulate the blade cross section must be deployed by boat and winched up and 
down from the hub or the turbine tower. Depending on anchoring mechanisms, these 
take considerable time to install, but have the advantage of offering the maintenance 
engineers a walking platform which presents more favourable for body configuration 
than harness suspension, and also a degree of weather protection for conducting the 
work. 
 
Fine motor tasks are undertaken across many industries. Since the pioneering work 
by Fitts (1954) identified a movement can be subdivided into rapid gross and slower 
fine components, a multitude of studies have considered the interplay of posture and 
task accuracy. For example, Berrigan et al. (2006) demonstrated longer movement 
duration in an aiming task with smaller target, and differences between task 
performance and standing and seated for a small target, noting a complex interplay of 
posture, movement, speed, and accuracy. For more gross, heavier object movement, 
the stabilisation of the body and degrees of freedom are perhaps more influential. 
The use of a grinder has been estimated to equate to 60 ± 40 N for up to 3.0 ± 1.5 
hours per day maximum (Lindquist & Skogsberg, 2007). When the operator is 
standing on a cradle system, the force of bodyweight and friction-coupling stabilises 
this horizontal force when working on the blade surface. When suspended, the 
energetic cost of bracing needs to be considered, along with the injury risk of 
continuous work for extended periods. 
 
While both harness-suspension and cradle approaches are in widespread use, across 
various applications, there is currently no research evidence to assess task efficacy 
might be favoured by either approach. As a result, this study sought to determine task 
efficacy and work quality in laboratory and field tests of manual dexterity which 
replicate fine motor tasks routinely undertaken by wind energy technicians, firstly in 
controls to develop the protocols and to estimate effect size and subsequently in 
rope-access professionals. 
 
2. Methods 
 
2.1 Population and sample 
 
The study recruited a total of 42 individuals in two separate samples. Experiment one 
used a convenience sample of 9 male and 7 female adults who were students and 
staff of Robert Gordon University with no previous experience of harness suspension 
and was conducted in the scanning and ergonomics laboratory on campus. 
Experiment two was based in an industrial hangar and recruited 25 male and 1 female 
qualified rope-access technicians with a minimum of one year’s professional 
experience from rope access training providers in Aberdeen and Kinross, UK. All 
provided informed written consent and the study was approved by the school 
research ethics committee (study SHS/18/23). Characteristics of the participants are 
provided in tables 1a and 1b, and manual dexterity scores for controls and ropeaccess technicians appear in tables 2 and 3 respectively.

There was an absence of comparable studies to base a sample size estimation from. 
However, a related study of arm support in seated and standing used 11 participants 
(Odell et al., 2007), while a reaction time study in upright and twisted postures used 
21 participants (Newell & Mansfield, 2008). Both these had the body supported either 
in standing or sitting, straight or twisted postures. Participants of the present study 
were required to be of working age (18-66 y) and provided written consent to take 
part. It was hypothesised that with a control sample, an indication of the effect size of 
tripod suspension might be possible, although with the likelihood that rope access 
engineers would be better than controls at balance and task efficacy, it was 
hypothesised that the effect would be smaller in rope access technicians. Each was 
screened for physical activity readiness using the PAR-Q (2002 version, based on 
original research validation by Thomas et al., 1992) answering all questions in the 
negative, and were required to be free from musculoskeletal injury for 6 months and 
to be apparently healthy at the time of testing. Participants were screened for 
contrast sensitivity using a Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity chart at 100 cm, (Haag – 
Streit, UK) to include only those participants who have adequate visual ability to 
detect a small difference in contrast. 
 
Stature and mass were assessed using a Seca portable stadiometer (model 217) and 
Seca digital scales (model 875; Seca, Frankfurt, Germany) using standard protocols 
(Stewart et al., 2011). Controls were measured wearing indoor clothing and without 
shoes. Rope access technicians (who arrived for the study directly from bridge 
maintenance work nearby) wore personal protective equipment and protective work 
boots, but removed harnesses and helmets for these measures. The additional mass 
of PPE and boots (3.2 kg) and height advantage offered by industry work boots (3.6 
cm) were subtracted accordingly. 
 
Participants underwent familiarisation (equivalent to two testing cycles) prior to the 
testing session, to ensure habituation and learning of the required tests and, 
additionally for controls, familiarisation with the harness suspension system. 
 
2.2 Test Conditions 
 
Experiment one involved healthy adult volunteers with no rope access training or 
experience. Tests were performed both seated at a horizontal bench surface and 
under harness suspension conditions using a portable industrial lifting tripod 
(Didsbury Lightweight tripod, Didsbury, UK). For experiment two, tests were 
performed standing, suspended under the same tripod, and additionally, with a 7.5 m 
suspension from the apex of the testing hangar, at an equivalent height above the 
floor as depicted in figure 1. All participants performed the tests under their 
respective conditions in a randomised order (www.randomize.org) to mitigate any 
residual learning effect of the tests.

and hanging conditions. 

2.3 Dexterity Tests 
 
Selection of suitable tests required them to be standardised and portable for field 
use, and to yielding data relatively quickly. Tests of manual dexterity were conducted 
using the preferred hand only and involved a modified peg placement task and a 
computerised shape delineation task. A modified Purdue pegboard test (Lafayette 
Industries, USA) was conducted involving individually grasping and placing 10 pegs, 
washers and collars in sequence as quickly as possible (depicted in Figure 3 L). 
Participants for both experiments were given two familiarisation trials in a seated 
position. For the test itself, in experiment one the pegboard was oriented horizontally 
on the lab bench, with a 10 cm gap between the seated participant’s torso and the 
edge of the bench. For tripod suspension, delineated with floor markings to locate the 
rolling furniture standardised the same relative position. In experiment two, the 
pegboard was secured in a vertical orientation 35 cm in front of the standing 
participants. Harness suspension for both tripod and 7.5 m hanging was carefully 
controlled to an equivalent horizontal distance within the reach envelope. (depicted

in figure 2). This distance was not adjusted according a person’s anthropometric size, 
therefore it is accepted that taller people had a ‘less stretched’ reach than shorter 
individuals.

A visual inspection test “TIMDEX” was specifically designed to simulate the precise 
identification of micro-pitting on a blade surface (Stewart et al., 2019). This involved a 
selection of low contrast shapes relative to the background being traced on a 
touchscreen laptop using the MS Power Point drawing tool (Figure 3, R). After 
familiarisation with 8 shapes, participants were given test shapes (4 in experiment 
one and 2 in experiment two). According to the speed-accuracy trade off on motor 
performance elucidated by Fitts (1954), it was decided to allow participants up to 15 s 
per shape to delineate them with the index finger of the preferred hand. Completed 
shapes were flood-filled, saved as PNG files and processed using the ‘magnetic lasso’ 
feature of Adobe Photoshop (version CC, 2017) and compared with the original 
template for precise pixel area using Image J 1.51r software (National Institutes of 
Health, USA). The total area of excursions beyond the shape boundary or incursions 
inside the shape boundary were summarised in a global error score calculated as the 
square root of the sums of the squares of the delineated-actual area differences, 
expressed as a percentage. Verbal feedback on shape delineation performance was 
provided to participants after their familiarisation session. Standardised positioning 
was adopted for this test, as for the pegboard test.

2.4 Statistical methods 
 
The condition state of tripod suspension or roof suspension was compared against 
the baseline states of sitting (experiment 1) and standing (experiment 2) with paired 
samples t-tests, and Cohen’s d estimate of effect size. A general linear model with 
repeated measures using body mass and years of experience as covariates was 
constructed for each test of rope access technicians for both tests with Bonferroni’s 
adjustment for multiple comparisons. The level of significance was set at P<0.05. 
Precision of analysis for the TIMDEX test was calculated for intra-tester and intertester technical error of measurement in pixel area in a sample of 8 individuals and 
expressed as a percentage of the mean value.

4.1 Key Findings 
 
Seated or standing is superior to harness suspension in terms of task efficiency based 
on pegboard time, both for untrained and experienced rope access technicians. While 
the shape delineation data are less clear-cut, they also display a similar effect. There 
does not appear to be a difference between long versus short suspension length in 
terms of these findings amongst rope access technicians. Rope-access years of 
experience failed to enhance task performance while suspended, evidenced by no 
interaction with standing – suspended difference for either test. Although this was

surprising and somewhat counter-intuitive, clearly other factors were more 
influential, suggesting that after their training to become qualified rope access 
technicians, years of experience had no additional effect. It is likely that experience 
might result in other benefits such as optimising comfort during the task, or being 
able to continue working for longer without discomfort, neither of which was 
measured in this study. 

The study design precluded direct comparison between controls and technicians. It 
could be hypothesised that experienced rope access technicians’ superior stability 
relative to controls in the tripod suspension would carry over to manual dexterity task 
performance, however the results from the present study do not bear this out. 
 
While the literature has no examples of fine motor skills amongst this occupational 
group, there is mixed evidence among other professions. Experienced podiatrists 
outperformed novices in strength and speed of fine motor tasks, novices were 
superior at coordination and sensory ability (Causby et al., 2018). Musicians 
outperformed non-musicians in timing but not spatial aspects of finger placement 
(Kincaid et al., 2002). As a result, it is not certain whether advantages by professionals 
over controls may be negated by other factors. In the present study, protocol 
differences did not facilitate direct comparison between groups or environments. The 
baseline measurement for controls was seated at the lab bench, while for rope access 
technicians, it was standing. Standing work allows the operator greater mobility and 
facilitates greater force generation (Lindquist & Skogsberg, 2007) while sitting 
constrains extraneous movement and stabilises dexterity movements relative to 
standing, avoiding postural sway and balance issues. Controls performed the 
pegboard tests on a horizontal surface while rope-access technicians performed the 
test when the board was constrained in a vertical position, upon advice from the 
industry to make the test more context-specific. A horizontal pegboard orientation is 
advantageous on two counts: for forearm support during aiming and force generation 
in pressing pegs into the slots, and also by gravity assisting the threading of collars 
and washers on the pegs. In addition, when harness suspended, a vertical pegboard 
orientation generates unwanted as pegs are placed onto it, as a result of equal and 
opposite reactive forces. In addition, controls were measured in a laboratory whose 
temperature remained very close to 18°C throughout the measurement acquisition. 
By contrast, rope access workers were measured when they were available in 
November and December, and not committed to the bridge repair work which 
occupies them throughout the warmer months. It is well-recognised that manual 
dexterity is detrimentally affected by cold temperatures, and despite being 
habituated to site work for 10 months of the year the ambient temperatures in the 
hangar for rope access workers was between 6 and 10°C. Because the test of manual 
dexterity required hands and fingers to manipulate the objects, gloves could not be 
worn. Previous evidence summarised in Heus et al. (1995) illustrated that decrements 
in functional dexterity have been detectable for finger skin temperatures below 20°C 
but important losses in dexterity occur at hand skin temperature of 15°C or below. 
Earlier work on task performance and cooling showed decrements in pegboard 
assessments and knot tying in military personnel (Lockhart et al. 1975). While this

temperature difference limits the comparability between controls and rope access 
technicians, randomisation of the order participants are effectively their own controls 
for assessing the effect of suspension on dexterity. Lastly, it is possible to speculate 
that finger size may have been greater amongst the technicians due to a 
predominance of manual work. Although not measured, if this were the case, it could 
have detrimentally affected both tasks. 
 
Multiple joints (degrees of freedom) are implicated in manual tasks undertaken in 
occupational work, and control of unwanted movement involves stabilisation via 
higher nervous system commands, with the result that controlled and uncontrolled 
degrees of freedom may be described and tested (Scholz & Schöner, 1999). In-built 
redundancy into the human body’s motor control system involve synergistic actions 
of motor effectors (neural organisations and joints) which increase with task 
complexity or uncertainty to facilitate successful task completion (Kim et al., 2012). 
The need for maintaining wind turbine blades is important from several standpoints. 
At a strategic level there is a cost function assigned to blade repair which is directly 
related to the levelised cost of energy (LCo E) due to efficiency gains following repairs 
(Offshore Renewables Energy Catapult, 2018). At a human level this is achieved via 
highly skilled manual work which commands musculoskeletal effort and its associated 
risk on maintenance personnel. Evidence from the present study suggests that work 
of this type is likely to be better accomplished by standing rather than being 
suspended, both in terms of accuracy (from the shape delineation test) and in terms 
of efficiency (from the pegboard test). However, there may be a third aspect to the 
advantage offered by standing on a platform which relates to musculoskeletal risk. 
Because harness suspended workers must tense themselves when exerting a force on 
the blade surface (required for grinding out pitting and other damage) this requires 
an antagonistic force which they must either exert individually or with a partner. 
Such isometric effort also has a cost, and in related work, occupational outcomes such 
as fatigue and pain may result from decreased motor variability of arm movements 
(Srinivasan et al., 2015). Elsewhere, evidence suggests task performance may be 
prioritised over energy expenditure for a contact-based task (Balasubramanian et al., 
2009). 
 
4.2 Implications for Practice and future work 
 
Implications of these findings suggest that standing tasks are likely to produce faster 
and more accurate work than with harness suspension. In practical terms, there are 
many other considerations as to which approach should be deployed, according to 
the precise nature of the task, weather variability and other environmental or 
logistical factors. While typical blade maintenance tasks might involve a 
predominance of work which has a more gross motor function than the finer dexterity 
assessed in the present study, in practice this would have been very difficult to 
measure experimentally without increased cost and risk. Nevertheless, until such 
future work is conducted, it would seem reasonable to assume that the arguments 
favour standing versus suspended work will apply.

These factors and the industry’s regulatory framework will become increasingly 
important within the rapidly developing but relatively young sector. Because 
industrial safety is paramount, it is also necessary to consider the demographics of 
the occupational group and how this may be anticipated to change. It is possible to 
draw parallels with the offshore oil & gas industry which underwent profound 
demographic change over a generation between 1984 and 2014 (Stewart et al., 
2017), with median age of employees increasing by 9 y. It would seem prudent to 
anticipate that the offshore wind energy industry could expect a similar demographic 
trajectory and that an age increase of this magnitude might conceivably affect 
functional performance. While manual dexterity might be affected less than other 
factors such as ladder ascent, peer and self-rescue, and emergency response, further 
research is required to ascertain this. Ultimately, these study data, together with 
supporting evidence elsewhere suggest the favourability of cradle systems in terms of 
work efficacy as well as minimising injury risk, although it is likely that harness 
suspension approaches will still be necessary under some circumstances.
