partners, will influence the next generation of software and
hardware development for optimal management of large
interconnected systems.
The industry-driven case studies of real applications that are
considered in the project include: 
• The balancing and stabilizing of the electricity distribution
grid of the city of Koprivnica that is a highly-automated
complex system involving multiple electricity producers
and consumers (households, charging stations of electrical
vehicles, etc.).
• The dynamic management of charging of electric vehicles
in the city of Malaga that involves the management of the
network of electrical vehicles and power station with vehicle-to-grid charging capabilities.
• The energy management of a large chemical production
site that seeks the right balance for an operation of the
power plant (steam network) to satisfy the demands of the
production subunits and to minimize the amount of
imported energy resources. 
• The cross-plant process management in an integrated
chemical production complex. This case study is concerned with managing a network of parallel reactors that
share a flare system and limited cooling power.
For the usability of the results, it is essential that the engineering, implementation and long-term maintenance of such
advanced solutions are taken into account. The project will
develop prototypical tools that facilitate development,
testing, deployment and maintenance of these solutions. A
key element of these engineering tools is an open simulation
platform that enables dynamic management and control
methods to be tested with accurate models of the overall
system and the connection to external models that are available in the application domains.
The expected technical outcomes of the project are: 
• Innovation in distributed management methods for complex interconnected systems,
• Progress in methods for the rigorous analysis and validation of systems of systems,
• Improvements in the management of electric grids and of
large production complexes,
• Tools for the engineering of management systems for systems of systems,
• Identification of technology gaps in advanced management and coordination methods.
The developed coordination methods will lead to improved
system stability and lower resource consumption in industrial production, and in electric power generation and distribution. This will result in a reduction of the CO2 emissions,
increased competitiveness of European industry and lower
prices for consumers. DYMASOS is thus contributing to the
goal of a greener and more competitive Europe.

3DHOP: A Novel
Technological Solution 
for the Development of
Online virtual Museums
by Marco Potenziani, Marco Callieri and Roberto
Scopigno
The interactive visualization of 3D content on the Web
has gained momentum in recent years, thanks to the
release of ad-hoc technology as part of HTML5.
However, so far, few products fully exploit this
opportunity for the easy and quick embedding of highresolution 3D models in a Web page. 3DHOP (3D
Heritage Online Presenter) is an advanced solution for
easy publishing of 3D content on the Web. 
3DHOP allows anyone with basic webpage-creation skills to
setup an HTML page displaying a scene composed by highresolution 3D models. This free tool is essentially a viewer
that can stream and render effectively 3D data over the net,
letting the user interact with high-resolution 3D content (see
Figure 1). It is oriented towards the Cultural Heritage (CH)
field, where the need to handle highly detailed digital representations of cultural artefacts is often mandatory; however,
it may also be useful in other contexts requiring high performance and interactive visualization of high-resolution 3D
content.
3DHOP has been developed by the Visual Computing Lab,
ISTI-CNR, in the framework of several EU projects
addressing the management of large collections of 3D digital
models: the EC IP project "3DCOFORM”, the EC No E “VMus T” and the EC pilot project “3D-ICONS”. It is the result
of 10 years of R&D focused on the design and implementation of easy-to-use tools that enable CH professionals to
present, visualize and enrich high-quality digital 3D models
(the first important result of which was the Inspector system
[1]).
The rationale underlying 3DHOP was the lack of tools to
manage the interactive visualization on the Web of high-resolution 3D geometries in a simple way. While there are various products (both free and commercial) that can re-create
complex virtual scenes made of simple 3D entities, they are
not suitable for the management of complex 3D geometry,

With 3DHOP, we hope to offer a novel and versatile solution
for publishing 3D content on the Web, facilitating deployment and access to high-resolution 3D resources by nonexperts in 3D programming. This new technology, particularly suitable for Online Virtual Museums, should encourage
the global dissemination and deployment of high-quality 3D
cultural heritage content via the Internet.

and are mainly aimed at expert Computer Graphics (CG)
developers.
3DHOP can be used by anyone with simple webpage-creation skills, without the need for specific CG expertise; the
goal was to be easy-to-use and easy-to-learn. For this reason,
3DHOP uses general web programming mechanisms
(declarative programming). The various components of the
visualization page (the 3D models, the Trackball, the
Canvas, the Scene) are treated like HTML entities in the
same way as the rest of the structural elements of the web
page, and are declared and customized using simple parameters. A developer can just pick a starting example and modify
it by simply changing some parameters of the entities (see
Figure 2).
3DHOP has been created using standard Web technologies
(like Java Script and HTML5), without relying on external
components; it can run on all the most widely used browsers
(Chrome, Firefox, Opera and soon IE) and all the principal
OS (Win, Mac-OS and Linux) without the need for plugins.
It must be stressed that although 3DHOP has been designed
for the Web, it only needs a Web browser to work; this means
that it can also run locally, to implement museum kiosks, for
example. Unlike similar tools, the 3DHOP viewer is totally
client side, and does not require a specialized server.
3DHOP currently supports two types of 3D models: singleresolution (PLY and soon OBJ) and multi-resolution
(NEXUS). In particular, the multiresolution Nexus technology (another achievement of ISTI-CNR), supports the
streaming of high-resolution 3D meshes over the HTTP protocol, enabling the exploration of very large models (millions
of triangles, like in Figure 3) on commodity computers with
standard internet connections. 3DHOP is based on Web GL
(the standard API for the CG on the Web developed as the
Java Script equivalent to Open GL|ES 2.0), and on Spider GL,
a Java Script utility support library for Web GL (again developed by the Visual Computing Lab [2]), which provides an
API with the typical structures and algorithms for real-time
rendering in the development of 3D web applications.
The evolution of 3DHOP will be focused on the integration
of visualization components for other multimedia layers, like
images, audio, video, etc. Work is already underway for the
management of large 3D terrains and RTI (Reflectance
Transformation Imaging) images [3].

defined using different text fields, easily modified by the user with
different values to build a similar small scene (fully textual
approach).
