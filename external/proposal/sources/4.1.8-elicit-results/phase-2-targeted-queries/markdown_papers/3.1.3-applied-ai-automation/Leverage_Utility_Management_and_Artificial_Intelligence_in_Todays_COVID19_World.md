ODAY’S WATER workforce—
operators, engineers, utility 
labor crews, laboratory technicians, and others—all work in 
proximity of contaminating agents every 
day, including Cryptosporidium, E. coli, 
Salmonella, viruses, and more. The recent 
outbreak and spread of the 2019 novel 
coronavirus, which leads to the disease 
COVID-19, has reinforced this realization 
and led to unprecedented effects on civil 
life, including the reorganization of lifehome-work patterns through statewide 
shelter-in-place orders, the restructuring of plant and operational workflows, 
reduced or shuttered commercial and 
industrial operations, and diverse but economically adverse impacts on our cities.
The recent experience of a single midsize water utility in northeast Illinois 
demonstrates how a proactive approach 
to automating water distribution network 
monitoring put it ahead of the sustainability curve, especially given today’s social 
and economic turbulence. Life-changing 
events, such as COVID-19, can affect distribution system behavior by reshaping 
demand patterns that can cause unexpected operational events. Real-time 
intelligence, preparedness, and prevention are priceless in such a context.
EMBRACING CHANGE
The village of Buffalo Grove is a suburban community about 20 miles 
northwest of Chicago, with a population of approximately 42,000 and 
about 12,000 water customers, of which 
90 percent are residential and 10 percent commercial or industrial. Water is 
sourced from Lake Michigan, purchased 
from the Northwest Water Commission, 
and conveyed through four pump 
stations and 183 miles of largely 
cast-iron and ductile-iron pipe ranging in size from 4 inches to 24 inches 
in diameter. The average day demand 
is approximately 3.7 mgd. All water 
distribution system operations are monitored through a centralized 24-7-365 
supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. The village also 
maintains an advanced metering infrastructure network that covers nearly 100 
percent of customer meters.
In recent years, water loss has 
become a top priority for many local 
utilities as state regulatory pressures 
to lower and account for nonrevenue water have increased. To address 
this challenge, the village partnered 
with Aquify, a subsidiary of Exelon, to 
implement a central event management 
system in 2019 that combines 24-7 distribution network monitoring, sensors, 
and machine learning software (through 
a collaboration with Ta Ka Du, a global 
software provider of central event 
management solutions for the water 
industry). Establishing this platform 
entailed installing 10 multiparameter 
electromagnetic insertion probes to 
measure flow, pressure, acoustics, and 
temperature across four defined zones 
or district metered areas (DMAs).
This approach allows the village to 
measure inflows and outflows in a DMA 
as well as monitor minimum nightlines 
for nonrevenue water and leakage analytics. It’s a long-term water loss control 
strategy that prioritizes leak detection 
dispatch and aligns decision making 
with budget allocation and pipe rehabilitation and repair.
In Buffalo Grove, the analytics 
software receives continuous data transmitted from the 10 insertion probes 
every six hours and one-minute reading 
outputs from the SCADA system installed 
at the utility’s four pump stations and 
reservoirs. The data are then integrated 
into an artificial intelligence platform for 
analysis, monitoring, and event management. The figure on page 24 illustrates

the location of all 10 independent sensor 
locations and four SCADA points across 
all the zones or DMAs.
Like many municipal public works 
departments, Buffalo Grove had minimal staff and too much data. 
“We operate with a lean staffing 
model and in recent years have been 
gathering more digital data from multiple sources,” explains Mike Skibbe, 
Buffalo Grove’s deputy director of 
public works. “But we don’t have the 
staff to watch screens all day or analyze 
data in real time. With an opportunity to 
form a public–private partnership, use 
our partner’s ability to monitor 24-7, 
and provide data analytics services, 
we’re finally able to leverage the many 
systems and data streams we’ve invested 
in over the years.” 
LIFE IN A PANDEMIC
In March 2020, the ripple effects of 
COVID-19 were felt nationwide when 
US shelter-in-place advisories were 
imposed to curb the spread of the 
virus. Like many public works departments, Buffalo Grove complied and 
reorganized priorities, adjusted work 
routines, and revised operational protocols to protect the community and 
safeguard employees. Administrative 
employees were required to work from 
home and minimize customer interaction through remote troubleshooting 
and service delivery. Critical operational field staff traveled independently 
instead of in groups to jobsites, complied with social distancing, and worked 
from assigned public works vehicles 
instead of going into the office.
The village’s demand patterns and 
water consumption behaviors changed 
considerably as businesses closed their 
doors and residents hunkered down in 
their homes. The village was able to leverage its new machine learning software 
and analytics platform to compare system 
performance pre-COVID-19 and during 
the shelter-in-place order. Notable trends 
were observed in daily demand patterns 
and nighttime averages in residential 
and nonresidential zones. The figure 
above illustrates how the typical weekday consumption profile flattened during 
the COVID-19 response to resemble a

characteristic weekend curve. The blue 
line represents actual or current zonal 
flow, and the green line is the historically 
based pattern, based on system learning.
When the shelter-in-place advisory 
was implemented, the previously distinct 
early morning “rush hour” corresponding to preparation for commutes to work 
and school was less recognizable, and 
the new peak demand shifted spatially 
to reflect a decreased sense of urgency 
in meeting early morning commitments. 
Residents used water later in the morning, 
and consumption continued consistently 
throughout the day as laundry and dishwashers kept up with families living 
in quarantine. On the opposite end of 
the spectrum, nonresidential demand 
plummeted as nonessential businesses, 
factories, and warehouses dramatically 
reduced production or closed completely. 
The data also provided visibility into 
other unexpected scenarios. For example, 
when the utility had no scheduled operations (and law enforcement routes may 
have been altered because of pandemic 
response), anomalies were detected that 
suggested unauthorized usage. 
Life-changing events, such as COVID-19, can affect distribution system behavior by 
reshaping demand patterns. Water professionals in the village of Buffalo Grove, Ill., have 
found real-time intelligence, preparedness, and prevention are priceless in such a context.

In addition to monitoring consumption patterns, the village was able to 
use the data analytics platform to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on billing 
revenues. The analysis determined 
that increased residential consumption 
and associated revenues would almost 
offset reductions in commercial consumption. Fortunately, Buffalo Grove 
relies predominantly on residential 
income because of its small percentage 
of commercial and industrial customers. Without continuous and intelligent 
data, the village would need to rely on 
its next billing cycle to run revenue 
comparisons in residential and nonresidential water demands, delaying weeks 
of critical administration planning and 
capital improvement work.
LESSONS LEARNED FROM COVID-19 
Skibbe and Buffalo Grove administrators have been leading an effort to shift 
to data-driven decision making and data 
management best practices for many 
years. But he predicts COVID-19 will be 
a turning point for how utilities will be 
managed in the future.
“This is the time that local government 
will reinvent itself,” he says. “There will 
be two types of communities: those that 
realize we need to adjust our service and 
staffing models and those that will try 
to continue operating in the same way 
we did yesterday. We still need to deliver 
clean and safe drinking water and reliable 
wastewater services, but we’ll need to do 
these things without the same level of 
certainty regarding revenue, with potentially fewer staff, and with employees 
located in remote locations.” 
Remote monitoring is one area that 
has generated increased curiosity as 
social distancing rules have been implemented. Now, Buffalo Grove operators 
have fewer opportunities to work from 
control rooms, teams often split up, and 
some staff members spend extended 
multiday or weeklong (or longer) shifts 
working and sleeping in control rooms. 
The ability to monitor and ultimately 
manage critical resources from decentralized locations is a key component to any 
resilience plan. Buffalo Grove is addressing this need by using cloud-based 
software that displays continuous flow 
and pressure data and 24-7 remote monitoring support. 
Limited resources are a major roadblock to implementing any of these 
new technologies. Although many of 
them have been on the market for years 
and are successfully deployed in other 
countries around the world, many US 
utilities simply don’t have the resources 
to source, procure, integrate, manage, 
and monitor these systems. This is where 
Skibbe sees an opportunity.
“Using new public-private models 
can help utilities implement solutions 
at lower costs and with less risk while 
leveraging third parties to do the work 
they may not have staff to do,” he says. 
Adopting automated technologies for 
field and reporting processes will also escalate as a result of COVID-19 as utilities learn 
how to handle a combination of retiring 
operators; pressure to “do more with less” 
from administrations, governing boards, 
and councils; and new technologies that 
help utilities become more efficient. From 
leak detection, pressure monitoring, and 
valve exercising to field sampling and filling 
out regulatory compliance forms, there are 
many opportunities for utilities to improve 
workforce and process efficiency.
