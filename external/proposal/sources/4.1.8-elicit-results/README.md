- Industry mapping documents

## Usage Instructions

### For Task 4.1.8.4 (Export relevant papers information):

1. **Start with Phase 1** - Use the broad discovery queries from the strategy document
2. **Organize by Research Area** - Save results in the appropriate 3.1.x subdirectories
3. **Export Formats** - Save papers as:
   - CSV exports from Elicit
   - Individual paper PDFs (if available)
   - Elicit paper summaries/extracts
   - Notebook exports

### For Task 4.1.8.5 (Convert Elicit.com papers to markdown):

1. **Process exports** from 4.1.8.4 into markdown format
2. **Maintain folder structure** - Keep markdown files in same directories as exports
3. **Include metadata** - Preserve Elicit extraction data, relevance scores, etc.

## File Naming Conventions

- **Query Results:** `query-[brief-description]-[date].csv`
- **Paper PDFs:** `[first-author-year]-[short-title].pdf`  
- **Markdown Conversions:** `[first-author-year]-[short-title].md`
- **Notebooks:** `notebook-[topic]-[date].json`
- **Summaries:** `summary-[topic/phase]-[date].md`

## Expected Search Queries (Reference)

Based on the strategy document, key queries to execute include:

**Phase 1 Broad Queries:**
- "Industry case studies of human factors challenges in distributed energy resource operations"
- "Commercial implementations of AI assistance for utility workers managing renewable energy systems"
- "Field research on communication problems between DER operators and automated systems"

**Research Area Specific Queries:** (See strategy document section 3.1 for complete list)

## Quality Criteria

Focus on papers with:
- **High Relevance:** Industry partnerships, real-world settings, commercial technology
- **Medium Relevance:** Applied research, industry funding, technology transfer
- **Industry Connection:** Clear links to energy companies, utilities, vendors

This structure supports the manual export process while maintaining organization that aligns with the systematic search strategy.
