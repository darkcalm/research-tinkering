**FA2:** Assessing Agent Interoperability Protocols to Bridge the Gap Between Device Heterogeneity and Best Practices in Distributed Energy Resource (DER) Management

**1\. Background**

In 2024, the average solar asset experienced a potential revenue loss of 214% over the past 5 years from equipment-driven underperformance; for sites under 5 MW, the gap of revenue between top and bottom performing 15% was $12,901 per MW [\[1\]](https://19545844.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/19545844/White%20papers/2025%20Raptor%20Maps%20Global%20Solar%20Report.pdf). PV O\&M management stresses predictive maintenance, AI, IoT, and digital twins over various scales and processes [\[2\]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2024.114342%20), and examples [\[3\]](https://www.ablesci.com/scholar/paper?id=r2WJaNJP3) [\[4\]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10799418) for improvement efforts over cost reductions of deploying technologically-intensive O\&M strategies are numerous.

However, as large generators that previously provided stability are being replaced with large volumes of small hierarchical systems, smaller units are designed with limited communication capabilities, often relying on proprietary protocols or basic, cost-optimized interfaces focused on local operational functions [\[5\]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9533179). Manufacturers prioritize ease of basic installation and low cost, which can restrict the embedded processing power and adherence to comprehensive communication standards [\[6\]](%20https://doi.org/10.3390/s23125694). Existing standards like IEC 61850, IEEE 2030.5, and data models from organizations like SunSpec Alliance aim to improve interoperability, but challenges remain in their universal adoption by simpler devices and their ability to support coordination.

This state results in a gap over the heterogeneous landscape where information of system-level best practices cannot spread beyond large operators towards individual DERs, and device-level best practices offer minimal interoperability beyond their own ecosystems. Further, this gap is amplified by evolving needs for security and adherence to grid codes and data privacy regulations [\[7\]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adapen.2024.100205). Without bridging this gap, DERs are underutilized, integrations complex and costly, security vulnerabilities persist, and growth is stunted.

New agent interoperability protocols such as Model Context Protocol (MCP from Anthropic), Agent Communication Protocol (ACP from IBM Research), and Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A from Google) offer potential to address these challenges [\[8\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.). These protocols aim to standardize how autonomous agents (which can represent or manage DERs) discover capabilities, exchange context, and coordinate actions; MCP, for instance, standardizes context delivery to AI models, while ACP and A2A target broader inter-agent communication, task orchestration, and decentralized discovery in various contexts [\[8\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.). Starke et al.  [\[5\]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9533179) demonstrated agent-based integration frameworks using simpler protocols like MQTT; newer AI-aligned protocols promise more advanced, standardized, and scalable solutions.

To date, no systematic assessment exists to evaluate whether these new agent interoperability protocols can effectively address the unique device heterogeneity and system coordination needs of DER management.

**2\. Objective:** To assess the potential of emerging agent interoperability protocols (MCP, ACP, A2A) to bridge device-level heterogeneity and system-level best practices in Distributed Energy Resources (DERs).

**3\. Specific Research Questions (SRQs):**

* **SRQ1:** Identify the key features of how device heterogeneity challenges the operationalization of DER management best-practices.  
* **SRQ2:** Analyze the addressability of agent interoperability protocols (MCP, ACP, A2A) on these challenges.

**4\. Scope and Limitations**

* **Protocols:** Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), and Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A) will be assessed, without the inclusion of new protocols or extensions to maintain focus and comparability.  
* **DER Context:** The assessment will be contextualized for common DER types (e.g., residential/small commercial solar PV, battery energy storage, EV charging infrastructure) and representative DER management use cases (e.g., data aggregation for monitoring, demand response, VPP participation), with limited or no field deployment on actual DER hardware.  
* **"Device heterogeneity"** will be defined in terms of typical communication interfaces (Modbus, UDP, MQTT, proprietary), processing resources (low-memory microcontrollers to industrial-grade controllers), and built-in security features.   
* **"System-Level Best Practices"** can describe (not limited to) interoperability, scalability, privacy, ease of integration, coordinated control and cybersecurity.   
* **"Bridging the Gap"** will be from the perspective of entities needing to integrate and manage diverse DERs, rather than from the device manufacturers, although implications for them can be considered.  
* **Analysis:** Simulations will be conceptual or small-scale, aimed at illustrating qualitative protocol behaviors rather than comprehensive performance benchmarking.  
* **Protocol Immaturity:** New protocols (emerging in 2024-2025) limits the availability of empirical data.  
* **Cybersecurity Assessment:** not involving audits or penetration testing of the protocols ​​and instead focus on protocol features relevant to data confidentiality, authentication, and authorization.

**5\. Methodology:** An explorative research methodology is proposed due to agent interoperability protocols being still nascent technologies with limited implementations, particularly in energy domains. This approach allows for the flexibility in inductive research while establishing a foundation for future empirical work.

**6\. Method:**

1. **Literature Review**: Review existing literature on DER management challenges, specifications of protocols, and identify integration gaps that emerging protocols might address.  
2. **Feature Identification**: Extract key protocol features relevant to DER management, identify technical characteristics of device heterogeneity, and map protocol capabilities to management requirements. Where field data is limited, complementary sources such as expert interviews can be incorporated.  
3. **Assessment Framework Development**: Formulate an evaluation framework with criteria derived from literature and DER requirements, defining metrics for protocol assessment. For example the metrics could include: latency, scalability, ease of deployment, security, support for low-resource devices.  
4. **Qualitative Comparative Analysis with Simple Case Simulation**: Apply the assessment framework to protocols using a representative DER use case, creating conceptual mappings to identify strengths, weaknesses, and needed adaptations. the simple use case will be 

**7\. Uncertainties and Risks Management**

**DER-Specific Protocol Implementation Challenges:** The application  of general-purpose agent protocols to DER systems faces unique challenges including resource constraints (limited processing power, memory, and bandwidth in edge devices), stringent reliability requirements, and real-time operation needs.

Management: The research may evaluate protocol adaptability for resource-constrained environments, reliability mechanisms, and real-time operation capabilities. Protocol adaptation recommendations will be developed specifically for DER contexts.

**Evolving DER Technology Landscape:** The rapid advancement of DER technologies (e.g., new inverter capabilities, vehicle-to-grid integration) creates moving targets for protocol implementations. Current protocol designs may not anticipate future DER capabilities or integration needs.

Management: The assessment may include forward-compatibility analysis, examining protocol extensibility mechanisms specifically in relation to emerging DER technologies. The framework will evaluate how protocols accommodate schema evolution, versioning, and backward compatibility.

**Data Volume and Privacy in Distributed Energy Systems:** DER systems generate volumes of high-frequency data, with energy consumption patterns revealing potentially sensitive information about user behavior. Agent protocols must handle these specific data characteristics while maintaining privacy.

Management: The research may evaluate protocols' suitability for high-volume data handling specific to energy systems, including that which is written in the scope under high-volume data contexts.
