      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a coherent framework for multi-machine analysis, using a group clustering model, which can be utilized for predictive maintenance (PdM). The framework benefits from the repetitive structure posed by multiple machines and enables for assessment of health condition, degradation modeling and comparison of machines. It is based on a hierarchical probabilistic model, denoted Gaussian topic model (GTM), where cluster patterns are shared over machines and therefore it allows one to directly obtain proportions of patterns over the machines. This is then used as a basis for cross comparison between machines where identified similarities and differences can lead to important insights about their degradation behaviors. The framework is based on aggregation of data over multiple streams by a predefined set of features extracted over a time window. Moreover, the framework contains a clustering schema which takes uncertainty of cluster assignments into account and where one can specify a desirable degree of reliability of the assignments. By using a multi-machine simulation example, we highlight how the framework can be utilized in order to obtain cluster patterns and inherent variations of such patterns over machines. Furthermore, a comparative study with the commonly used Gaussian mixture model (GMM) demonstrates that GTM is able to identify inherent patterns in the data while the GMM fails. Such result is a consequence of the group level being modeled by the GTM while being absent in the GMM. Hence, the GTM are trained with a view on the data that is not available to the GMM with the consequence that the GMM can miss important, possibly even key cluster patterns. Therefore, we argue that more advanced cluster models, like the GTM, can be key for interpreting and understanding degradation behavior across machines and ultimately for obtaining more efficient and reliable PdM systems."

The HOVON-87/NMSG18 study was a randomized, phase 3 study in newly diagnosed transplant ineligible patients with multiple myeloma, comparing melphalan-prednisolone in combination with thalidomide or lenalidomide, followed by maintenance therapy until progression (MPT-T or MPR-R). The EORTC QLQ-C30 and MY20 questionnaires were completed at baseline, after three and nine induction cycles and six and 12 months of maintenance therapy. Linear mixed models and minimal important differences were used for evaluation. 596 patients participated in HRQoL reporting. Patients reported clinically relevant improvement in global quality of life (QoL), future perspective and role and emotional functioning, and less fatigue and pain in both arms. The latter being of large effect size. In general, improvement occurred after 6–12 months of maintenance only and was independent of the World Health Organisation performance at baseline. Patients treated with MPR-R reported clinically relevant worsening of diarrhea, and patients treated with MPT-T reported a higher incidence of neuropathy. Patients who remained on lenalidomide maintenance therapy for at least three months reported clinically meaningful improvement in global QoL and role functioning at six months, remaining stable thereafter. There were no clinically meaningful deteriorations, but patients on thalidomide reported clinically relevant worsening in neuropathy. In general, HRQoL improves both during induction and maintenance therapy with immunomodulatory drugs. The side effect profile of treatment did not negatively affect global QoL, but it was, however, clinically relevant for the patients. (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NTR1630)."

      "abstract": "General cognitive function is a prominent and relatively stable human trait that is associated with many important life outcomes. We combine cognitive and genetic data from the CHARGE and COGENT consortia, and UK Biobank (total N = 300,486; age 16–102) and find 148 genome-wide significant independent loci (P < 5 × 10−8) associated with general cognitive function. Within the novel genetic loci are variants associated with neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, physical and psychiatric illnesses, and brain structure. Gene-based analyses find 709 genes associated with general cognitive function. Expression levels across the cortex are associated with general cognitive function. Using polygenic scores, up to 4.3% of variance in general cognitive function is predicted in independent samples. We detect significant genetic overlap between general cognitive function, reaction time, and many health variables including eyesight, hypertension, and longevity. In conclusion we identify novel genetic loci and pathways contributing to the heritability of general cognitive function. Cognitive function is associated with health and important life outcomes. Here, the authors perform a genome-wide association study for general cognitive function in 300,486 individuals and identify genetic loci that implicate neural and cell developmental pathways in this trait."

      "abstract": "Background: Novel agents have recently questioned the role of both autotransplantation and consolidation therapy after intensification in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. We prospectively compared intensification with transplantation versus bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone (VMP), and bortezomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (VRD) consolidation versus no consolidation. \n \nMethods: In this randomized, open-label, phase 3 study we recruited previously untreated myeloma patients aged up to 65 years at 172 sites of the European Myeloma Network. Patients were first randomized (1:1) to VMP (4 cycles) or transplantation, and afterwards to VRD consolidation (2 cycles) or no consolidation, followed by lenalidomide-maintenance. Progression-free survival from first and second randomization were primary endpoints. Comparison of single versus double transplantation was a secondary endpoint. \n \nFindings: Between February, 2011 and April, 2014, 1503 patients were enrolled. Overall, 1197 patients were eligible for the first randomization: 702 received transplantation and 495 VMP; 877 patients underwent the second randomization: 449 received VRD consolidation and 428 no consolidation. Progression-free survival from first randomization was significantly better with transplantation than with VMP (median, 56·7 versus 41·9 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0·73, 95% CI 0·62-0·85, p=0·0001). VRD consolidation prolonged median progression-free survival from second randomization compared with no consolidation (58·9 versus 45.5 months; HR 0·77, 95% CI 0·63-0·95, p=0·014). Overall survival estimates at 5 years were 75% with transplantation and 71·6% with VMP (HR 0·90, 95% CI 0·71-1.13, p=0·35). Double transplantation significantly prolonged progression-free survival (HR 0·74, 95% CI 0·56-0·98, p=0·036) and overall survival (HR 0·62, 95% CI 0·41-0·93, p=0·022) compared to a single transplantation. The rate of at least one grade ≥3 adverse event was 88% with transplantation versus 52% with VMP. Transplant-related mortality was 1%. \n \nInterpretation: In newly diagnosed myeloma patients, intensification therapy with transplantation significantly prolonged progression-free survival compared with VMP, although overall survival was similar. After intensification, VRD consolidation significantly improved progression-free survival compared with no consolidation. \n \nTrial Registration: This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01208766. \n \nFunding Statement: The Dutch-Belgian Cooperative Trial Group for Hematology Oncology (HOVON) sponsored and designed this study. Janssen and Celgene provided bortezomib and lenalidomide free of charge, respectively, and provided funding, but had no role in the analysis or interpretation of the data. \n \nDeclaration of Interests: Michele Cavo: receives honoraria from Janssen, Celgene, Amgen, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Takeda, AbbVie, Sanofi, Adaptive Biotechnologies, and is a member of Janssen’s and Celgene’s Speaker’s Bureau.

      "abstract": "We assessed the predictive capacity of the HCV-MOSAIC risk score, originally developed for primary early HCV infection, as a screening tool for HCV reinfection in 103 men who have sex with men (MSM) with HIV using data from the MOSAIC cohort, including MSM with HIV/HCV-coinfection who became reinfected (cases, n = 27) or not (controls, n = 76) during follow-up. The overall predictive capacity of the score was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. The effects of covariates on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were assessed using parametric ROC regression. The score cut-off validated for primary early infection (≥2.0) was used, from which the sensitivity and specificity were calculated. The AUROC was 0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.63–0.84). Group sex significantly increased the predictive capacity. Using the validated cut-off, sensitivity was 70.4% (95%CI = 49.8–86.2%) and specificity was 59.2% (95%CI: 47.3–70.4%). External validation from a cohort of 25 cases and 111 controls, all MSM with HIV, resulted in a sensitivity of 44.0% (95%CI = 24.4–65.1) and specificity of 71.2% (95%CI = 61.8–79.4). The HCV-MOSAIC risk score may be useful for identifying individuals at risk of HCV reinfection. In sexual health or HIV-care settings, this score could help guide HCV-RNA testing in MSM with a prior HCV infection."

      "abstract": "Many railway assets suffer increasing wear and tear during operation. Prognostics can assist diagnosis by assessing the current health of a system and predicting its remaining life based on features that capture the gradual degradation in a system’s operational capabilities. Prognostics are critical to improve safety, plan successful work, schedule maintenance, and reduce maintenance costs and down time. Unlike fault diagnosis, prognosis is a relatively new area, but it has become an important part of Condition-based Maintenance (CBM) of systems. As there are many prognostic techniques, usage must be attuned to particular applications. Broadly stated, prognostic methods are either data-driven or model-based. Each has advantages and disadvantages; consequently, they are often combined in hybrid applications. A approach hybrid model can combine some or all model types (data-driven, and phenomenological); thus, more complete information can be gathered, leading to more accurate recognition of the fault state. This approach is especially relevant in railway systems where the maintainer and operator know some of the failure mechanisms, but the complexity of the infrastructure and rolling stock is huge that there is no way to develop a complete model-based approach. Therefore, hybrid models are extremely useful for accurately estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of railway systems. The paper addresses the process of data aggregation into a hybrid model to get RUL values within logical confidence intervals so that the life cycle of railway assets can be managed and optimised."

      "abstract": "The Hamburg City Health Study (HCHS) is a large, prospective, long-term, population-based cohort study and a unique research platform and network to obtain substantial knowledge about several important risk and prognostic factors in major chronic diseases. A random sample of 45,000 participants between 45 and 74 years of age from the general population of Hamburg, Germany, are taking part in an extensive baseline assessment at one dedicated study center. Participants undergo 13 validated and 5 novel examinations primarily targeting major organ system function and structures including extensive imaging examinations. The protocol includes validate self-reports via questionnaires regarding lifestyle and environmental conditions, dietary habits, physical condition and activity, sexual dysfunction, professional life, psychosocial context and burden, quality of life, digital media use, occupational, medical and family history as well as healthcare utilization. The assessment is completed by genomic and proteomic characterization. Beyond the identification of classical risk factors for major chronic diseases and survivorship, the core intention is to gather valid prevalence and incidence, and to develop complex models predicting health outcomes based on a multitude of examination data, imaging, biomarker, psychosocial and behavioral assessments. Participants at risk for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, stroke and dementia are invited for a visit to conduct an additional MRI examination of either heart or brain. Endpoint assessment of the overall sample will be completed through repeated follow-up examinations and surveys as well as related individual routine data from involved health and pension insurances. The study is targeting the complex relationship between biologic and psychosocial risk and resilience factors, chronic disease, health care use, survivorship and health as well as favorable and bad prognosis within a unique, large-scale long-term assessment with the perspective of further examinations after 6 years in a representative European metropolitan population."

      "abstract": "General cognitive function is a prominent human trait associated with many important life outcomes1,2, including longevity3. The substantial heritability of general cognitive function is known to be polygenic, but it has had little explication in terms of the contributing genetic variants4,5,6. Here, we combined cognitive and genetic data from the CHARGE and COGENT consortia, and UK Biobank (total N=280,360). We found 9,714 genome-wide significant SNPs (P<5 × 10−8) in 99 independent loci. Most showed clear evidence of functional importance. Among many novel genes associated with general cognitive function were SGCZ, ATXN1, MAPT, AUTS2, and P2RY6. Within the novel genetic loci were variants associated with neurodegenerative disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, physical and psychiatric illnesses, brain structure, and BMI. Gene-based analyses found 536 genes significantly associated with general cognitive function; many were highly expressed in the brain, and associated with neurogenesis and dendrite gene sets. Genetic association results predicted up to 4% of general cognitive function variance in independent samples. There was significant genetic overlap between general cognitive function and information processing speed, as well as many health variables including longevity."

      "abstract": "\n \n EKM, AM and MD contributed equally to this work.\n BACKGROUND. Despite major advances in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) in the past two decades, outcomes remain heterogenous, with some patients being primary refractory and others being long-term non-progressors. There is still an unmet need to identify patients at risk for early relapse/progression (ER) upfront to tailor new treatment strategies and improve outcomes in this population.\n METHODS. This analysis included data from 10843 patients with newly diagnosed (ND)MM treated in 16 international, multicenter clinical trials from 2005 to 2016. Data were collected by the European Myeloma Network (EMN) within the HARMONY Platform (www.harmony-alliance.eu) supported by the European Hematology Association (EHA).\n The primary endpoint was a landmark analysis of overall survival (OS) starting from 18 months after randomization in patients with and without ER within 18 months from MM diagnosis (ER<18). ER<18 as an independent factor and baseline factors associated with ER<18 were analyzed in multivariable models. An additive scoring system to predict ER<18 was developed based on a clinical and statistical selection of MM disease parameters. High-risk cytogenetic abnormalities (HRCA) were defined as either del(17p), t(4;14), t(14;16) or +1q21. Patients who were censored (n=442) or died without progressive disease within the first 18 months (n=661) were excluded from the analyses.\n RESULTS. A total of 9740 patients were available for the landmark analyses at 18 months from MM diagnosis (median follow-up: 72 months, IQR 58-87), 1970 of whom had an ER<18 (1254 deaths), 7051 had no ER<18 (2392 deaths) and 719 had died with progressive disease within the first 18 months. OS at 18 months from MM diagnosis was significantly shorter in patients with ER<18 vs those without ER<18 (median OS: 48 [95% CI 46-51] vs 115 months [95% CI 109-122], HR 3.32, 95% CI 3.10-3.56, p<0.0001). In a multivariable model including 2768 complete patient cases, ER<18 was an independent prognostic factor (HR 2.79, 95% CI 2.60-3.00, p<0.0001), along with established prognostic factors such as International Staging System (ISS) stage III (vs I: HR 1.83, 95% CI 1.65-2.02, p<0.0001), HRCA (vs standard risk: HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.58-1.99, p<0.0001) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; yes vs no: HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.20-1.43, p<0.0001).\n ER<18 was significantly associated with single-hit HRCA (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.27-1.83, p<0.0001) and double-hit HRCA (OR 2.87, 95% CI 2.24-3.68, p<0.0001). Other factors associated with ER<18 were ISS stages II and III (II: OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.35-1.72, p<0.0001; III: OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.79-2.37, p<0.0001) and elevated LDH (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.21-1.56, p<0.0001). Treatment with a proteasome inhibitor plus an immunomodulatory agent vs only one of the two drug classes significantly reduced the risk of ER<18 (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.42-0.53, p<0.0001). The dissection of HRCA in a similar multivariable model revealed that double-hit HRCA involving del(17p) had the overall strongest association with ER<18 (OR 3.32, 95% CI 2.29-4.81, p<0.0001), followed by single-hit del(17p) (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.59-3.17, p<0.0001).\n An additive scoring system for ER<18 identified single-hit HRCA (1 point), double-hit HRCA (2), ISS II (1), ISS III (2) and elevated LDH (1) as significant MM disease-specific parameters. Patients with low (0-1 points, 47% of patients), intermediate (2-3, 44%) and high (4-5, 9%) counts had gradually increasing and statistically significant different risks for ER<18 of respectively 18% (reference), 33% (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.92-2.78, p<0.0001) and 49% (OR 4.51, 95% CI 3.37-6.04, p<0.0001). Among patients with ER<18, the three risk categories retained their prognostic impact, with a median OS at 18 months from MM diagnosis of 68 (95% CI 56-89), 41 (95% CI 37-46) and 29 months (95% CI 25-34) in the low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups, suggesting OS heterogeneity even among functional high-risk MM patients.\n CONCLUSIONS. Our unique, large dataset of NDMM patients confirmed the unmet need for patients with ER<18 and brought to light the adverse prognostic impact of del(17p) as single- or double-hit HRCA. Although it did not account for all patients with ER<18, the accumulation of established MM-specific risk factors was associated with an increasing risk for ER<18, and MM-specific risk factors retained their prognostic significance among functional high-risk patients.\n"

      "abstract": "Background: Several population-based studies on multiple myeloma (MM) have shown an improvement in relative survival (RS) for patients aged 65 years or younger at the time of diagnosis. In patients aged 75 years or older, the improvement in long-term RS is absent in most reports or much less pronounced. To our knowledge, only 2 studies based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database have demonstrated a significant increase in RS for this age-group. (Pulte et al. 2011, Costa et al. 2017) We performed a population-based study on Norwegian MM-patients to provide up-to-date estimates on changes in relative survival during the past 3 decades.\n Methods: The Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN) was established in 1951 and provides high-quality nationwide cancer statistics. For MM, the reported completeness of case-ascertainment is above 95%. Incidence data and all reported cases of MM diagnosed between January 1, 1982 and December 31, 2017 were retrieved from the CRN (n=10 961). Nationwide drug consumption statistics for drugs used in myeloma treatment were retrieved from the Norwegian Drug Wholesales Statistics and the Norwegian Prescriptions Database, Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Follow-up ended December 31, 2017. The time of MM-diagnosis was divided into 7 categories: 1982-1987, 1988-1992 (melphalan-prednisone), 1993-1997(early high-dose melphalan with autologous stem-cell transplant (HDM-ASCT)), 1998-2002 (introduction of thalidomide), 2003-2007 (early thalidomide upfront, introduction of bortezomib), 2008-2012 (thalidomide and bortezomib upfront, introduction of lenalidomide), 2013-2017 (lenalidomide upfront, early pomalidomide, daratumumab, panobinostat and carfilzomib). Age at diagnosis was divided into 3 categories; <65 years, 65-79 years and 80 years or older. We estimated relative survival ratios (RSR) with 95% confidence intervals 5 and 10 years after the time of diagnosis by the Ederer-II method. The analysis was stratified by age-group and calendar period of diagnosis. Cohort analysis was applied to calendar periods with complete follow-up, and period analysis was applied where complete-follow up was not available (2013-2017 and 10-year estimates for 2008-2012). Non-overlapping confidence intervals were considered statistically significant.\n Results: The age-standardized incidence rate was stable until approximately year 2000, followed by an increasing tendency reaching 8.4 cases per 100 000 persons in 2017. Figure 1. Patients diagnosed before the age of 65 had a steady increase in both 5 and 10-year RSR across all calendar periods. For patients aged 65-79 years, the 5- and 10-year RSR's were stable at approximately 0.3 and 0.1, respectively, until the calendar period 1998-2002. In the following years, an improvement in both 5- and 10-year RSR was observed. The 5-year RSR improved significantly from 0.31 (95% CI; 0.27-0.35) in the first calendar period to 0.43 (95% CI;0.39- 0.47) during 2008-2012. The predicted 5-year RSR for 2013-2017 was 0.48 (95% CI; 0.44-0.52). There were also signs of improved 10-year RSR, predicted to 0.23 (95% CI; 0.18-0.27) during 2013-2017 compared to 0.11 (95% CI; 0.08-0.14) during 1982-1987. The 5-year RSR for patients aged 80+ years was 0.11 (95% CI; 0.01-0.17) during 1982-1987 and the 10-year RSR was 0.03 (95% CI; 0.01-0.11). In the following 4 calendar periods the RSR-estimates fluctuated before a rising tendency during the last 2 periods. The 5-year RSR improved significantly to 0.26 (95% CI; 0.20-0.32) during 2008-2012 and further rising to a predicted value of 0.32 (95% CI; 0.25-0.38) during 2013-2017. Figure 2. Additionally, complete annual prescription statistics for the oral agents thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide were obtained.\n Conclusions: We provide real-world observations on changes in RS in a population-based cohort of 10 961 MM-patients. We demonstrate an improvement in 5-year relative survival across all age-groups, including patients aged 80 years or older. For patients <65 years, there was a steady increase in RS since 1982 and we see no obvious impact of the implementation of HDM-ASCT. For the other age-groups, the improvement in RS coincides with the introduction of new drugs. The increase in incidence since 2000 may be due to increased testing for M-protein. We can point to the introduction of new drugs and increased incidence of indolent cases as possible reasons for increasing RS.\n \n \n \n No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.\n"

      "abstract": "Background: Healthcare-associated infection (HAI) surveillance is essential for most infection prevention programs and continuous epidemiological data can be used to inform healthcare personal, allocate resources, and evaluate interventions to prevent HAIs. Many HAI surveillance systems today are based on time-consuming and resource-intensive manual reviews of patient records. The objective of HAI-proactive, a Swedish triple-helix innovation project, is to develop and implement a fully automated HAI surveillance system based on electronic health record data. Furthermore, the project aims to develop machine-learning–based screening algorithms for early prediction of HAI at the individual patient level. Methods: The project is performed with support from Sweden’s Innovation Agency in collaboration among academic, health, and industry partners. Development of rule-based and machine-learning algorithms is performed within a research database, which consists of all electronic health record data from patients admitted to the Karolinska University Hospital. Natural language processing is used for processing free-text medical notes. To validate algorithm performance, manual annotation was performed based on international HAI definitions from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Sepsis-3 criteria. Currently, the project is building a platform for real-time data access to implement the algorithms within Region Stockholm. Results: The project has developed a rule-based surveillance algorithm for sepsis that continuously monitors patients admitted to the hospital, with a sensitivity of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85–0.93), a specificity of 0.99 (0.98–0.99), a positive predictive value of 0.88 (0.83–0.93), and a negative predictive value of 0.99 (0.98–0.99). The healthcare-associated urinary tract infection surveillance algorithm, which is based on free-text analysis and negations to define symptoms, had a sensitivity of 0.73 (0.66–0.80) and a positive predictive value of 0.68 (0.61–0.75). The sensitivity and positive predictive value of an algorithm based on significant bacterial growth in urine culture only was 0.99 (0.97–1.00) and 0.39 (0.34–0.44), respectively. The surveillance system detected differences in incidences between hospital wards and over time. Development of surveillance algorithms for pneumonia, catheter-related infections and Clostridioides difficile infections, as well as machine-learning–based models for early prediction, is ongoing. We intend to present results from all algorithms. Conclusions: With access to electronic health record data, we have shown that it is feasible to develop a fully automated HAI surveillance system based on algorithms using both structured data and free text for the main healthcare-associated infections.

      "abstract": "The pharmaceutical industry is an important contributor to the health of the UK economy, with 65 000 people directly employed and many more in support industries [1]. It delivered a net trade surplus of £2.6 billion to the UK economy in 2002 and was rated as the highest value-adding industry, with £78 000 of value added to the economy per industry employee in the same period. It is a highly competitive global industry with significant high-risk, long-term investment in increasingly costly drug discovery and development activity. It takes ~10–12 years to bring a new medicine to market and the average development cost is £350 million, with high attrition rates. The rewards are high for successful transnational players, with pre-tax profits of 30% on sales [2]. The industry presents particular challenges to occupational health practitioners engaged in the delivery of effective occupational health services. The demands of a highly technical work environment must be blended with the need to maintain effective health management in a fast-paced, changing and pressured global business climate. This, combined with a high level of focus on innovation and productivity through human capital development strategies, provides a rich mix of factors to take into account when selecting and implementing health interventions that are appropriate, risk-targeted, cost-effective and acceptable to employees and management. An overview of health hazards in the industry published in 1947 provides a familiar list of headings and exposure issues to today’s pharmaceutical occupational health practitioner. The contemporary collection of reviews in this issue of Occupational Medicine provides an update: so, has anything changed beyond the product names that populate the lists of recognized causes of exposure-related health effects? [3] Providing rational, risk-based advice on the prediction, prevention and management of exposure-related health effects from a diverse and novel range of workplace health hazards requires increasingly specialized technical competences and industry knowledge. Binks reviews occupational toxicology and the control of exposure to pharmaceutical agents at work [4]. He provides insight into the high level of resource investment and multidisciplinary expertise applied to predicting the potential adverse effects of occupational exposure. The industry has pioneered occupational hazard categorization systems and led the way in developing novel approaches to the containment of highly potent biologically active substances. Heron and Pickering review the published evidence for health effects related to exposure to active pharmaceutical ingredients [5]. The literature continues to be dominated by well-known historical clusters of occupational illness burden associated with particular classes of drug compounds and there is a paucity of recently published data. Is this a cause for optimism that the battle has been won? Laboratory animal allergy (LAA) remains an important and potentially life-threatening cause of occupational sensitization, often with significant career implications for those affected. Gordon and Preece [6] present a summary of the state of the art in preventing this condition. They offer encouragement that investment in a policy-driven integrated approach to allergen exposure control can result in a reduction in incidence. The lower level of importance of occupational health interventions, such as health surveillance, compared to other components of LAA risk management systems is noted. However, occupational health practitioners remain well placed to play a key role in facilitating and co-ordinating the Director, Southern Client Services, Aon Health Solutions, 2 Circus Place, London EC2M 5RS, UK.

      "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is often over expressed in ovarian cancer (OVCA), promoting ascites and effusions. Preclinical studies of inhibition of VEGF and its receptors (VEGFR) show activity in OVCA xenografts. Clinical interest in evaluating VEGF (R) inhibition was triggered when the Gynecologic Oncology Group demonstrated single agent activity of the VEGF targeted antibody, bevacizumab (BEV) in recurrent OVCA. Since that time, BEV and small molecular VEGFR inhibitors have been studied in numerous phase II and III trials in OVCA. Randomized BEV trials are the most mature with results reported in first line (GOG218, ICON7), platinum sensitive recurrent disease (OCEANS trial) and platinum resistant recurrent disease (AURELIA trial) settings. All trials gave concurrent chemotherapy + BEV with some providing maintenance BEV after chemotherapy. All have shown a biological effect of the addition of BEV with higher response rates and longer progression free survival (PFS) in BEV arms. To date, no trial has shown overall survival (OS) improvement, although mature analyses for OS are awaited. Quality of life data have not suggested a benefit with BEV and toxicity is greater. Results of phase III trials of VEGFR inhibitors cedarinib, pazopanib and nintedanib are awaited. The BEV results lead to several important questions: 1) in the absence of significant OS improvement to date, is there sufficient patient benefit from PFS increases to warrant incorporation of BEV into ovarian cancer treatment? And when over the course of the disease should the agent be given? 2) Is the use of BEV cost effective and affordable? 3) Which patient subset is benefiting most? Subgroup analysis of the ICON7 study, suggests that patients with greater bulk disease (Stage III> 1 cm residual and Stage IV) seem to derive more PFS benefit. Indeed in this subgroup, overall survival also was improved. However, in the GOG0218 trial, the hazard ratio for PFS was observed to be better in patients with < 1 cm residual. Some have suggested VEGF A plasma levels may be predictive of BEV benefit, but no results from the BEV OVCA trials are yet published. In summary, clinical results to date show significant PFS improvements from BEV in 4 trials, but it is unclear if this will translate into improved OS and how best and in whom BEV should be used in OVCA management.

Purpose Haptoglobin (Hp) is an innate antioxidant and scavenges haemoglobin. In humans, Hp is present in three major genotypes: Hp 1-1, 2-1, and 2-2. The antioxidant ability of Hp is genotype-dependent. Hp 2-2 has previously been associated with a progressive decline in renal function and enhanced risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. In renal transplant recipients no previous data exist regarding the infl uence of Hp genotype. The aim of this study was to examine the relation between Hp genotype, graft loss, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in renal transplant recipients. Methods In a cohort of 1989 Norwegian renal transplant recipients Hp genotype was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. Follow-up data on graft loss, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality were registered in a validated database (Norwegian renal registry). Data were analyzed using a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. Results Median follow-up was 5.1 years with 432 (21.7%) events. When divided in three groups according to Hp genotype no difference was seen between groups regarding graft-loss, cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. In a multivariate analysis, adjustment for the following variables: age, gender, estimated glomerular fi ltration rate, body mass index, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, time on dialysis, transplant number, donor age, living donor, HLA-DR mismatches, cholesterol and number of anti-hypertensives, did not alter the results. Multivariate analysis for graft loss or death: Hp 2-2 (ref), Hp 2-1 (HR 1.13 (0.92-1.39), p 0.25) and Hp1-1 (HR 0.97 (0.71-1.3), p 0.82). Conclusion In a large cohort of renal transplant recipients with long-term follow-up, Hp genotype did not infl uence graft loss, cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. Abstract# C1775 Endothelial Progenitor Cells in Kidney Transplant Patients. F. Damiano,1 G. Ligabue,1 S. De Biasi,2 M. Granito,1 A. Cossarizza,2 G. Cappelli.1 1Dept of Surgery, Medicine, Dentistry and Morphological Scienses, University Hospital of Modena, Nephrology Unit, Modena, Italy; 2Dept of Surgery, Medicine, Dentistry and Morphological Scienses, University of Modena & Reggio Emilia,, Modena, Italy. Background: Circulating bone-marrow derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) promote vascular repair. Lower concentrations of EPCs correlate with cardiovascular risk. In uremic patients, the number of functionally active EPCs is reduced. Kidney transplantation (KTx) improves both survival and endothelial function in patients with advanced renal failure. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of KTx and immunosuppressive therapy on the number of EPCs. Methods: EPCs were measured by fl ow cytometry analysis in 51 renal transplant patients (52±13,92 years; mean eGFR 52,61±19,90 ml/min) and 25 healthy subjects (49±15 years; mean eGFR 94±23 ml/min). We examined the associations between counts of EPCs and traditional cardiovascular risk factors, uremia related risk factors, kidney function and immunosuppressive agents. Results: EPCs numbers were similar in Kidney transplant recipients and controls. We found signifi cant (p<0.05) independent inverse associations between counts of EPCs and age, sistolic and diastolic blood pressure and C-Reactive Protein (CRP). Renal transplant recipients with reduced graft function (mean eGFR <30 ml/min) had lower EPCs counts compared with healthy volunteers(1,05-05 ± 1,17-05 vs.3,9504 ± 8,35-04 as % on 5x106 PBMc; p=0,0105). Patients receiving regimen therapy including corticosteroids showed signifi cantly lower EPCs number (1,77-02± 1,24-02 vs.6,74-04 ± 9,77-04 as % on 5x106 PBMc; p<0,0001). The use of Cyclosporine and Everolimus induced a further decrease in EPCs number compared to Cyclosporine and Mycophenolate (7,70-05 ± 1,65-04 vs.6,74-04 ± 9,77-04 as % on 5x106 PBMc; p=0,0044). Conclusions: EPCs numbers in KTx are comparable to those found in healthy subjects. In addition, this study suggests negative associations in KTx between EPC counts and age, blood pressure, CRP, graft function and use of some immunosuppressive drugs combination. These fi ndings indicate an improved potential for endothelial repair after KTx, suggest a different effect from different anti-rejection drugs and emphasize the role of EPCs as marker of endothelial health and predictors of cardiovascular outcomes. C1775 Endothelial Progenitor Cells in Kidney Transplant Patients. F. Damiano,1 G. Ligabue,1 S. De Biasi,2 M. Granito,1 A. Cossarizza,2 G. Cappelli.1 1Dept of Surgery, Medicine, Dentistry and Morphological Scienses, University Hospital of Modena, Nephrology Unit, Modena, Italy; 2Dept of Surgery, Medicine, Dentistry and Morphological Scienses, University of Modena & Reggio Emilia,, Modena, Italy. Background: Circulating bone-marrow derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) promote vascular repair. Lower concentrations of EPCs correlate with cardiovascular risk. In uremic patients, the number of functionally active EPCs is reduced. Kidney transplantation (KTx) improves both survival and endothelial function in patients with advanced renal failure. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of KTx and immunosuppressive therapy on the number of EPCs. Methods: EPCs were measured by fl ow cytometry analysis in 51 renal transplant patients (52±13,92 years; mean eGFR 52,61±19,90 ml/min) and 25 healthy subjects (49±15 years; mean eGFR 94±23 ml/min). We examined the associations between counts of EPCs and traditional cardiovascular risk factors, uremia related risk factors, kidney function and immunosuppressive agents. Results: EPCs numbers were similar in Kidney transplant recipients and controls. We found signifi cant (p<0.05) independent inverse associations between counts of EPCs and age, sistolic and diastolic blood pressure and C-Reactive Protein (CRP). Renal transplant recipients with reduced graft function (mean eGFR <30 ml/min) had lower EPCs counts compared with healthy volunteers(1,05-05 ± 1,17-05 vs.3,9504 ± 8,35-04 as % on 5x106 PBMc; p=0,0105). Patients receiving regimen therapy including corticosteroids showed signifi cantly lower EPCs number (1,77-02± 1,24-02 vs.6,74-04 ± 9,77-04 as % on 5x106 PBMc; p<0,0001). The use of Cyclosporine and Everolimus induced a further decrease in EPCs number compared to Cyclosporine and Mycophenolate (7,70-05 ± 1,65-04 vs.6,74-04 ± 9,77-04 as % on 5x106 PBMc; p=0,0044).

Abstract# C1776 Osteoporosis and Fractures After Solid Organ Transplantation: A Nationwide Population-Based Case-Control Study. T. Yu,1,2 C. Kao.2 1Internal Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan; 2Clinical Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan. Objectives: Metabolic bone disease after solid organ transplantation (SOT) is becoming an important complication to consider in chronic transplant patients. However, few population studies have described long-term outcomes of osteoporosis and related fractures after SOT. Therefore, we devoted to investigate the prevalence of bone disorders after SOT and to compare the risk of different SOT in a nationwide population-based study. Methods: We used Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database to identify 9,535 solid organ transplant recipients and 38,140 gender and age matched-control subjects to compare the incidence and risk of bone disorders in both groups. Results: Patients with SOT had a signifi cantly higher incidence rate of osteoporosis and related fractures as compared to the non-SOT group. The overall hazard ratio of osteoporosis after transplantation for SOT patients was 5.36 (95% CI= 3.298.72) as well as HR of related fractures was 6.07(95% CI =4.039.16) after adjustment. The highest sexand age-specifi c HR were observed in the male patients (HR=7.79, 95% CI=3.46-17.5) and those with an age ≤50 years (HR=7.46, 95% CI=2.50-22.3). In addition, SOT patients without any comorbidity had an 8.96-fold higher risk of developing osteoporosis than non-SOT subjects (HR=8.96, 95% CI=5.25-15.3). To compare the risk of osteoporosis and related fractures among different SOT patients, the highest risk of osteoporosis as well as fractures was noted among patients receiving lung transplantation followed by other types of SOT. Conclusion: In the study, we report unacceptably high rates of metabolic bone disorders after SOT in chronic transplant patients over a long follow-up period. Pre-transplant bone disorders and immunosuppressant agents are supposed to be involved with metabolic disorders after transplantation.

Utilizing a sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) layer, this framework integrates real-time and historical production data from a physical manufacturing system to a digital twin, enabling dynamic simulation and analysis. Maintenance decisions are informed by DRL algorithms that analyze this data, facilitating smart maintenance strategies that adaptively prioritize tasks based on predictive analytics. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through a case study in a lab-scale drone factory, where maintenance tasks are prioritized using a proximal policy optimization. This integration not only refines maintenance decisions but also aligns with the broader goals of operational efficiency and sustainability in Industry 4.0. Our results highlight the potential of combining DRL with digital twins to significantly enhance decision-making in industrial maintenance, offering a novel approach to predictive and prescriptive maintenance practices."

      "abstract": "Because of the global need to increase power production from renewable energy resources, developments in the online monitoring of the associated infrastructure is of interest to reduce operation and maintenance costs. However, challenges exist for data-driven approaches to this problem, such as incomplete or limited histories of labelled damage-state data, operational and environmental variability, or the desire for the quantification of uncertainty to support risk management. This work first introduces a probabilistic regression model for predicting wind-turbine power, which adjusts for wake effects learnt from data. Spatial correlations in the learned model parameters for different tasks (turbines) are then leveraged in a hierarchical Bayesian model (an approach to multi-task learning) to develop a\"metamodel\", which can be used to make power-predictions which adjust for turbine location - including on previously unobserved turbines not included in the training data. The results show that the metamodel is able to outperform a series of benchmark models, and demonstrates a novel strategy for making efficient use of data for inference in populations of structures, in particular where correlations exist in the variable(s) of interest (such as those from wind-turbine wake-effects)."

      "abstract": "Abstract : One data collection system the US Air Force uses to capture all aircraft maintenance actions is the Core Automated Maintenance System (CAMS). Infrastructure and hardware are in place at Nellis AFB for CAMS to be used via a mobile device on the flightline. The mobile system at Nellis AFE is referred to as the Nellis AFE CAMS at the Flightline system. This document describes a usability test conducted by the Air Force Research Laboratory and the University of Dayton Research Institute at Nellis AFB: The test assessed the Nellis AFB CAMS at the Flightline system accessing CAMS via two different modes. These modes of maintenance documentation were: 1) a portable laptop accessing CAMS via wireless frequency and 2) the desktop device accessing CAMS via wired network. The conditions tested included: 1) opening work orders, 2) listing open work orders, and 3) closing work orders in both the stationary CAMS condition and in the mobile CAMS condition. This study focused on the differences and similarities between the stationary CAMS and mobile CAMS access methods, as well as the usability of each. Significant time savings are realized by use of the mobile system when required travel time is included as part of the overall task; however, when time required for the additional logon required in the mobile condition is included in the analysis, no significant time savings are observed for the mobile system as compared to the stationary method. The additional sign-on time is identified as the key factor precluding significant time savings when using the mobile system."

Here, we review the role of computational modeling in helping to unlock this complexity, allowing the dissection of intricate feedback dynamics. We focus on three forms of epigenetic memory encoded in gene regulatory networks, DNA methylation, and histone modifications and discuss the important advantages offered by plant systems in their dissection. We summarize the main modeling approaches involved and highlight the principal conceptual advances that the modeling has enabled through iterative cycles of predictive modeling and experiments. Lastly, we discuss remaining gaps in our understanding and how intertwined theory and experimental approaches might help in their resolution.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES\nCarbamylation describes a post-translational protein modification associated with adverse outcomes in ESRD, but the risk implications of changes in carbamylation over time are not well understood.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS\nWe investigated the 1-year natural history of protein carbamylation in patients initiating maintenance hemodialysis and determined the prognostic value of longitudinal carbamylation changes in relation to mortality. In a nested patient-control study, we measured serial carbamylated albumin concentrations in select participants from a large incident dialysis cohort followed from 2004 to 2005 (n=10,044); 122 individuals who survived at least 90 days but died within 1 year of initiating hemodialysis (patients) were randomly selected along with 244 individuals who survived for at least 1 year (controls; matched for demographics). Carbamylated albumin concentration was measured using plasma collected at dialysis initiation and every subsequent 90-day period until 1 year or death.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBaseline carbamylated albumin concentration was similar between controls and patients (mean±SD; 18.9±0.7 and 19.8±1.1 mmol/mol, respectively; P=0.94). From dialysis initiation to day 90, carbamylated albumin concentration markedly fell in all patients, with controls -9.9±0.8 mmol/mol (P<0.001) and patients -10.0±1.2 mmol/mol (P<0.001). Adjusted repeated measures analysis of carbamylated albumin concentration from dialysis initiation to 1 year or death showed that the mean change (95% confidence interval) in carbamylated albumin concentration from baseline to final measure differed significantly between groups (-9.3; 95% confidence interval, -10.8 to -7.7 for controls and -6.3; 95% confidence interval, -7.7 to -2.8 for patients; P<0.01). There were no such between-group differences in blood urea levels, Kt/V, or normalized protein catabolic rate. Mortality prediction assessed using c statistics showed that carbamylated albumin concentration, when modeled continuously as the difference from baseline to final, improved a fully adjusted model from 0.76 to 0.87 (P=0.03).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nProtein carbamylation decreased with dialysis initiation, and a greater reduction over time was associated with a lower risk for mortality. Carbamylation changes were able to predict individuals' mortality risk beyond traditional variables, including markers of dialysis adequacy and nutrition."

      "abstract": "PurposeConfigurators support product and service specification processes by automating tasks, such as producing quotes, operation plans and bills of materials. However, misalignment between configurator objectives and development processes poses threats to the success of configurator projects. To address such problems, this research presents a coordinated approach to improve configurator development and reduce the likelihood of project failure, through the use of coordinated performance assessment.Design/methodology/approachThe suggested approach was developed by organizing existing configurator performance measurement methods, which were identified through a literature review. A longitudinal, action research–based case study was conducted on a large energy company that operates offshore oil and gas platforms in Denmark. The case study evaluates the usefulness of the proposed approach through a maintenance work configurator developed in the case company.FindingsThe case shows that early-stage co-scoping of a configurator and its performance metrics can ensure the alignment of configurator objectives and performance measures and can secure the data required to achieve comprehensive performance measurements. These measures, in turn, support the continuous improvement of the configurator in its subsequent development cycles. The results of the empirical case study suggest that the approach produces considerable benefits in cost reduction and improved efficiency in configurator development.Originality/valueExisting approaches to configurator development and implementation place little emphasis on the derivation and decision-support capability of performance measures. To address this, the proposed approach provides a structured, integrated method to continuously guide the development and implementation of configurator projects through performance assessment."

      "abstract": "\n BACKGROUND\n Unfractionated heparin (UFH), is an anticoagulant drug considered a high-risk medication in that an excessive dose can cause bleeding, while an insufficient dose can lead to a recurrent embolic event. Following initiation of intravenous (IV) UFH, the therapeutic response is monitored using a measure of blood clotting time known as the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Clinicians iteratively adjust the dose of UFH to a target aPTT range, with the usual therapeutic target range between 60 to 100 seconds.\n \n \n OBJECTIVE\n The aim of this study was to develop and validate a ML algorithm to predict, aPTT within 12 hours after a specified bolus and maintenance dose of UFH.\n \n \n METHODS\n This was a retrospective cohort study of 3273 episodes of care from January 2017 to August 2020 using data collected from electronic health records (EHR) of five hospitals in Queensland, Australia. Data from four hospitals were used to build and test ensemble models using cross validation, while the data from the fifth hospital was used for external validation. Modelling was performed using H2O Driverless AI® an automated ML tool, and 17 different experiments were conducted in an iterative process to optimise model accuracy.\n \n \n RESULTS\n In predicting aPTT, the best performing experiment produced an ensemble with 4x LightGBM models with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 31.35. This dataset was re-purposed as a multi-classification task (sub-therapeutic, therapeutic, and supra-therapeutic aPTT result) and achieved a 59.9% accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.735. External validation yielded similar results: RMSE of 30.52 +/- 1.29 for the prediction model, and accuracy of 56.8% +/- 3.15 and AUC of 0.724 for the multi-classification model.\n \n \n CONCLUSIONS\n According to our knowledge, this is the first study of ML applied to IV UFH dosing that has been developed and externally validated in a multisite adult general medical inpatient setting. We present the processes of data collection, preparation, and feature engineering for purposes of replication.\n"

Older expert and amateur pianists showed the normal pattern of large age-related reductions in standard measures of general processing speed. Performance on music-related tasks showed similar age-graded decline for amateur pianists but not for expert pianists, whose average performance level was only slightly below that of young expert pianists. The degree of maintenance of relevant pianistic skills for older expert pianists was predicted by the amount of deliberate practice during later adulthood. The role of deliberate practice in the active maintenance of superior domain-specific performance in spite of general age-related decline is discussed."

      "abstract": "Traditionally, working memory is conceptualized as a system involved in the maintenance and manipulation of information in the absence of external stimulation. Intuitively, working memory might be considered a formalized system for describing thought (Jonides, 1995). When you consider what is “on your mind”—from mental images to inner speech—you are considering your working memory. In this conceptualization, working memory is transient—lasting for however long the thought remains useful, typically on the order of seconds. Functionally, working memory is a mental work space that is critical for higher-level cognitive abilities. Several tasks have been devised to measure the capacity of working memory or the amount of information one can hold in mind (Luck & Vogel, 1997; Turner & Engle, 1989). Individual differences in performance on these tasks predict reasoning, planning, problem-solving, and a variety of other cognitive abilities (Carpenter, Just, & Shell, 1990; Daneman & Carpenter, 1980; Daneman & Merikle, 1996; Fukuda, Vogel, Mayr, & Awh, 2010; Just & Carpenter, 1992), demonstrating the importance of having a large mental work space. As a result of its broad impact, a clear understanding of working memory is essential for understanding cognition. Because of its central importance, working memory has been a topic of intense interest in psychology and neuroscience. Foundational research in working memory was performed by Baddeley and colleagues, and to this day Baddeley’s multicomponent model remains one of the most influential models of working memory (Baddeley, 1986, 2012; Baddeley & Hitch, 1974). Although a full treatment of the model and the data that support it is outside the scope of this chapter, certain key assumptions of the model lay the groundwork for the issues to come. First, the model assumes that working memory is distinct from long-term memory. That is, the processes that underlie the temporary maintenance of information for working memory can be distinguished from the processes that underlie the more permanent retention of information associated with long-term memory. Second, the model assumes distinct representational bases for different kinds of information. For example, materials that can be verbalized (e.g., words, letters) are represented in a qualitatively distinct way from materials that can be visualized (e.g., faces, scenes). Finally, the model assumes that processes that select, modulate, and manipulate retained information are"

The term Edge Computing refers to this new paradigm where computation is performed away from the traditional cloud, in a more distributed manner and physically closer to the actual gathering of data. However, in large scale applications like an energy smart grid system spanning entire cities, there are many challenges that need to be faced for such a system to perform effectively, namely the continuous communication and exchange of information between heterogeneous edge devices, sensors and actuators, and the division of devices in spatial clusters that need to perform special operations depending on the characteristics of the area. The aim of this paper is to provide a small-scale conceptual architecture for the communication of clusters of edge devices in a smart grid system, using the actor model and the AKKA framework as a communication backbone."

      "abstract": "The rapid digitalization of healthcare systems has led to an unprecedented accumulation of sensitive patient data across various platforms, exposing the industry to growing risks of data breaches, unauthorized access, and integrity compromise. Ensuring the security, privacy, and trustworthiness of healthcare data is paramount to maintaining patient confidentiality and enhancing clinical decision-making. This study proposes a conceptual framework that synergistically integrates Blockchain technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance healthcare data security. The framework is designed to address key challenges such as data integrity, access control, real-time threat detection, and secure interoperability across healthcare stakeholders. Blockchain, with its decentralized and immutable ledger capabilities, provides a robust foundation for tamper-proof data storage and transparent audit trails. Smart contracts are employed to automate access controls and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. AI, on the other hand, plays a critical role in intelligent threat detection and anomaly monitoring. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the framework can identify suspicious patterns, detect insider threats, and predict potential breaches in real time. The proposed architecture comprises four core components: Secure data ingestion, blockchain-based data storage, AI-powered analytics, and a privacy-preserving access management layer. The framework also incorporates role-based authentication and homomorphic encryption techniques to enhance data privacy while supporting authorized data sharing. Case scenarios such as electronic health record (EHR) exchange and remote patient monitoring are used to demonstrate the practicality and scalability of the model. This integrated approach not only ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of healthcare data but also fosters trust among patients, providers, and regulatory bodies. The framework aligns with global healthcare data standards and complies with regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR. Future directions include the deployment of federated learning models to further decentralize AI training while maintaining data privacy across institutions."

Researchers target is to find the reasons, layers, and resolving techniques of employees’ frustration in the SMEs of Bangladesh. \nMethods/analysis: Qualitative content analysis with multiple case studies and focused group studies has been applied in this study following Yin and Andalib to collect and analyze data. NVIVO tool and soft systems technique has been applied to analyze collected data. \n Findings: The study mainly observes and analyzes employees’ mental state of five SMEs of Bangladesh to understand and find out the reasons’ and layers of employees’ frustration. Researchers have also found the resolving techniques by detailed analysis and designed a conceptual model by introducing employees’ rights in the model. From previous scholars’ works employees’ frustration reasons, its categories, behavioral pattern of the employees’ when frustrated, differences between threat and conflict have been found and discussed. From qualitative multiple case studies of five SMEs and focused group discussion among twenty employees, three major themes are identified, which are employees’ need, barriers creating frustration, and layers of employees’ frustration. Later, while developing the conceptual model employee rights’ got introduced and resolving techniques have been added as per employees’ suggestions from the focused group discussion. \nNovelty/improvement: The novelty and originality of this research lies in its methods of analyzing especially in the qualitative method, where both multiple case studies and focused group discussion have been parts since that SMEs should be brought under qualitative research more to gain more deeper understanding and insight. Moreover, Andalib mentioned in 2018 that the inclusion of component ‘employees’ rights’ in the conceptual model to resolve frustration has been an importantly novel addition. \nKeywords: Conceptual Model, SME Cases, Focused Group Discussion, Layers of Frustration, Resolving Techniques."

      "abstract": "Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLT) are emerging decentralized infrastructures touted by researchers to improve existing systems that have been limited by centralized governance and proprietary control. These technologies have shown continued success in sustaining the operational models of modern cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance applications (DeFi). These applications has incentivized growing discussions in their potential applications and adoption in other sectors such as healthcare, which has a high demand for data liquidity and interoperability. Despite the increasing research efforts in adopting blockchain and DLT in healthcare with conceptual designs and prototypes, a major research gap exists in literature: there is a lack of design recommendations that discuss concrete architectural styles and domain-specific considerations that are necessary for implementing health data exchange systems based on these technologies. This paper aims to address this gap in research by introducing a collection of design patterns for constructing blockchain and DLT-based healthcare systems that support secure and scalable data sharing. Our approach adapts traditional software patterns and proposes novel patterns that take into account both the technical requirements specific to healthcare systems and the implications of these requirements on naive blockchain-based solutions."

On one hand, they offer unmatched performance advantages compared to relational database systems. On the other hand, NoSQL database management systems evolve at a very fast pace and are more challenging to understand and master, compared to relational database management systems. The fact that each NoSQL database management system has its own query language raises additional challenges for users (both experts and non-experts in computer science) in working or starting to work with them. Visual Query Systems can help in addressing this challenge by offering a more intuitive way of interacting with the database server. Based on a conceptual model which uses conceptual graphs to represent database structure and queries, we propose a Visual Query System for Apache Cassandra, the leading NoSQL database management system of the wide column stores DB-Engines ranking."

      "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has made significant development in recent years, and it is currently applied not only in simulators and games but also in embedded systems. However, when implemented in a real-world context, reinforcement learning is frequently shown to be unstable and incapable of adapting to realistic situations, particularly when directing a large number of agents. In this paper, we develop a decentralized architecture for reinforcement learning to allow multiple agents to learn optimal control policies on their own devices of the same kind but in varied environments. For such multiple agents, the traditional centralized learning algorithm usually requires a costly or time-consuming effort to develop the best-regulating policy and is incapable of scaling to a large-scale system. To address this issue, we propose a decentralized reinforcement learning algorithm (DecRL) and information exchange scheme for each individual device, in which each agent shares the individual learning experience and information with other agents based on local model training. We incorporate the algorithm into each agent in the proposed collaborative architecture and validate it in the telecommunication domain under emergency conditions, in which a macro base station (BS) is broken due to a natural disaster, and three unmanned aerial vehicles carrying BSs (UAV-BSs) are deployed to provide temporary coverage for mission-critical (MC) users in the disaster area. Based on the findings, we show that the proposed decentralized reinforcement learning algorithm can successfully support multi-agent learning, while the learning speed and service quality can be further enhanced."

      "abstract": "PurposeStudies show that data quality (DQ) issues are extremely costly for companies. To address such issues, as a starting point, there is a need to understand what DQ is. In his context, the 1996 paper “Anchoring data quality dimensions ontological foundations” by Wand and Wang has been highly influential on the understanding of DQ. However, the present study demonstrates that some of the assumptions made in their paper can be challenged. On this basis, this study seeks to develop clearer definitions.Design/methodology/approachThe assumptions behind Wand and Wang’s DQ classification are discussed, on which basis three counter-propositions are formulated. These are investigated through a representation theoretical approach involving analyses of deficient mappings between real-world and information system states. On this basis, an intrinsic DQ classification is derived. A case study is conducted to investigate the value of the developed DQ classification.FindingsThe representation theoretical analysis and the case study support the three propositions. These give rise to the development of a DQ classification that includes three primary intrinsic DQ dimensions (accuracy, completeness and conciseness), which are associated with six primary value-level DQ deficiencies (inaccuracy, incorrectness, meaninglessness, incompleteness, absence and redundancy). The case study supports the value of extending Wand and Wang’s DQ classification with the three additional data deficiencies.Research limitations/implicationsBy improving the conceptual clarity of DQ, this study provides future research with an improved basis for studies and discussions of DQ.Originality/valueThe study advances the understanding of DQ by providing additional clarity."

      "abstract": "Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are a significant breakthrough in intelligent transportation systems which allow vehicles to exchange information and with other vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure in realtime. But the utilization of vehicular data collection and aggregation poses problem areas in the issues of privacy, security and performance. This research presents a new conceptual model to employ deep learning algorithms for privacy preservation of data aggregated in V ANETs. We adopt differential privacy for providing privacy-preserving capabilities, federated learning and the usage of the blockchain make it more scalable and secure and edge computing to retain efficiency for solving these challenges. It's about adding controlled noise in order to prevent data points from being reverse engineered, differential privacy is used. Federated learning is used to decentralize the data processing, where participation of the central location is opted out and raw data transmission is kept to the barest minimum as a means of ensuring data privacy. Blockchain technology adds another layer of more secure and reliable aggregation of data improving the overall security of transactions and the prevention of alteration or sabotage. Edge computing is incorporated to ensure the real-time response of the system hence minimizing the latency of the system besides enhancing the performance of the system. In this regard, the study demonstrates that the proposed system ideally implements all the three objectives concerning privacy, data usefulness and real-time capability. Although using differential privacy slightly affects the accuracy of a model it greatly enhances the privacy of data. Together with edge computing, federated learning avoids performance degradation in privacy-preserving computations by decentralizing computations and minimizing transmission costs. The combination of block-chains with the existing networks helps to eliminate cases of data manipulation while the minor adverse impacts towards the systems” network latency are packet."

      "abstract": "Abstract. Metrology has been a slowly digitalizing field in which a significant part of the handling of data has been dependent on paper-based processes. Due to the need for the improved efficiency and reliability of these processes, digitalization has become a major topic of interest in the metrology community. Data formats such as the digital calibration certificate (DCC) have an essential role as an enabler of further digitalization, acting as the harmonized data format for calibration data. Naturally, introducing these data formats into industrial usage sets new requirements with respect to the calibration management and associated systems. Diversity of metrology also means that the systems need to be flexible and scalable to fulfill the needs of actors in the global calibration infrastructure with very different requirements. This paper presents a conceptual approach for enhancing the communications between the existing systems in a calibration ecosystem and enabling DCC-based data exchange with third-party systems using the Beamex calibration ecosystem as an example. Thus, the presented system architecture concept that introduces data and DCC exchange services would provide a solution to enable the use of DCCs on Beamex systems.\n"

Its major challenges are reliability,\nand security related issues during data delivery. To mitigate these, the development of secure\nrouting protocols, which are capable of optimum utilization of WSNs’ nodes resources for\neffective data delivery, has been one of the major research interests. However, most of the existing\nsingle path routing protocols for WSNs are not able to meet with up with the performance requirements\nof the mission and safety-critical systems. Meanwhile, a few that are multipath require\nhigh computational power, energy and their multiple paths are not ranked, this makes them unsuitable\nas routing protocol for WSNs in mission and safety-critical systems.\n\n\n\nIn this work, we propose a secure multipath routing protocol based on sectorisation and\nbest neighbouring nodes selection models to meet up with the performance requirements of WSNs\nin the mission and safety-critical systems. The protocol is capable of providing optimal multiple\nranked route paths for reliable data delivery.\n\n\n\nA route management technique, using direct approach, is developed for selecting different\noptimal data paths for reliable data routing. Also, simple but efficient lightweight privacy preserving\nauthentication scheme is proposed for the protocol to ensure security and privacy during\ndata routing. Computational and security analysis were performed to ascertain its efficiency in\nterms of computational cost, energy consumption and security.\n\n\n\nThe results showed that SMRP achieved better performance compared to the two stateof-\nthe-art solutions in terms of end-to-end delay, energy consumption and data routing reliability.\n\n\n\nThe proposed protocol is suitable for wireless sensor network due to its low delay,\nlow energy consumption and routing reliability metrics.\n"

However, current ICT-based agriculture systems are centralized and fail to address problems such as information asymmetry and reliability. Besides, consumers are keen to know the origin of food (traceability), intermediaries focus on transparency of shareable data and tracking of transactions are the areas to be studied in depth for smart and sustainable farming. Disruptive technology like blockchain is suitable to effectively manage smart farming. Blockchain promises reliability and authenticity of source of information as it can track the origin of a transaction. Several researchers have proposed conceptual frameworks and models. However, there is a limited study on real-time architecture that uses blockchain and decentralized applications to address the issues for smart farming. This research in progress paper presents the current gaps and focuses on incorporating blockchain to a smart and sustainable farming by developing an effective architecture. The research outcomes of the proposed study will benefit the agriculture value chains, intermediaries, farmers, and food suppliers in Australia."

      "abstract": "This paper presents a blockchain-based architecture for facilitating clinical communications within the historically underfunded rare disease community. Due to the complex nature of diagnosing and treating these conditions, patients with rare diseases are often referred to multiple care providers and specialists. Each care provider instructs patients to provide identification information to onboard them to their in-house medical record system. An effective identity management service or platform is needed to avoid repetitive steps and to identify patients in a scalable, collaborative, and sustainable way. This work proposes a decentralized, blockchain-based identity management infrastructure driven by interoperability across data management systems to accurately identify unique patients within rare disease communities and provide a supporting platform that facilitates the management and exchanges of information about identities. The proposed system identifies and represents participants with specific roles using a domain-specific digital identifier model. Once a patient's information is certified by a verifier, a Unique Digital Identifier is created for them that is linked to a persistent document holding their “cyber” identity. This allows the patient to identify themselves by presenting only the digital proof of their Unique Digital Identifier ownership during the subsequent medical encounters. Overall, we present a conceptual framework that allows for the fast identification of patients in the rare disease community that minimizes duplication of entries. It also enables providers and researchers to receive updates and exchange knowledge about rare diseases in an unambiguous way."

      "abstract": "Multi-UAV systems typically require complex in-frastructure to deploy in real-world scenarios, limiting their accessibility and scalability. In addition, current research often relies on custom solutions or proprietary hardware to facilitate inter-UAV communication. In this paper, we propose an open-source, low-cost, plug-and-play solution to enable decentralized UAV-to-UAV communication over 2.4GHz Wi-Fi using a con-nectionless protocol. Our approach simplifies the deployment of decentralized systems by allowing UAVs to easily exchange any type of binary data, seamlessly interfacing with ROS2. The solution uses an ad-hoc style network that allows UAVs to join or leave dynamically without requiring centralized governance or a priori configuration. We describe the architecture of the system, assess the network performance in an outdoor environment using UAVs, and evaluate the system's ability to share information as a swarm through hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) and experiments using UAVs. Our results show that the proposed system facilitates connectivity and is able to transmit mission-critical data for real-world UAV operations. HITL experiments show that a decentralized planning algorithm running on three simulated UAVs can effectively reach consensus on decentralized task allocation. We have made the code public and thus provide a viable solution for researchers seeking to implement decentralized UAV swarms using cost-effective commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and minimal infrastructure."

      "abstract": "In recent years, Blockchain arose as a key technology in building autonomous decentralised financial systems. Its ability to digitize trust enables building trustless systems such as cryptocurrencies where users do not need to rely on any third party to exchange value. The success of cryptocurrencies to operate without any intermediaries draw the interest of business operators who seek to bypass intermediation and thus to reduce cost and gain competitive advantages. As a result, Blockchain was used outside the crypto-sphere to build decentralized systems. However, this portage led to the inception of new types of Blockchains adapted to different specifications and with different designs. Consequently, the technology has diverged from its baseline (Bitcoin) to the point where some systems marketed as “blockchain” share only a few design concepts with the original Blockchain design proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto. This conceptual divergence alongside the lack of comprehensive models and standards made it difficult for both system designers and decision-makers to clearly understand what is a blockchain or to choose a suitable solution.This survey has a double goal; on the one hand, it attempts to contribute to the discussion on the ontological status of DLTs by providing a taxonomy oriented-framework (DCEA) for conceptualizing and examining DLT. On the other hand, it also attempts to present an up-to-date review and evaluation of current blockchains and their variants as constructed of four layers: the data, consensus, execution and application layers."

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a multi-agent message transport architecture to support application areas which need fast message communications for close collaboration among agents. In the FIPA(Foundation of Intelligent Physical Agents) agent platform, all message transfer services among agents are in charge of a conceptual entity named ACC(Agent Communication Channel). In our multi-agent message transport architecture, the ACC is represented as a set of system agents named MTSA(Message Transfer Service Agent). The MTSA enables close collaboration among agents by supporting asynchronous communication, by using Reactor pattern to handle agent input messages efficiently, and by selecting optimal message transfer protocols according to the relative positional relationships of sender agents and receiver agents. The multi-agent framework SMAF(Small Multi-Agent Framework), which is implemented on the proposed multi-agent message transport architecture, shows better performance on message transfer among agents than JADE(Java Agent Development Environment) which is a well-known FIPA-compliant multi-agent framework. The faster the speed of message transfer of a multi-agent architecture becomes, the wider application areas the architecture can support."

      "abstract": "The diverse applications of Machine-Type Communication (MTC) lead to exponential growth in Machine to Machine traffic. In connection with MTC deployment, a large number of devices are expected to access the wireless network simultaneously, resulting in network congestion. The conventional Random Access mechanism lacks the capability to handle the large number of access attempts expected from massive MTC (mMTC). Additionally, mMTC transceivers often operate by generating short data packets in a sporadic and sometimes unpredictable manner. To address the growing need for efficient communication in massive machine-type communication scenarios we propose an innovative solution, called Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Multi-Access (DRLMA). Our model considers the Base Station (BS) as an agent navigating the landscape of machine-type communication devices. This agent dynamically switches between grant-based and grant-free access to leverage their strengths. We address the multi-access problem, formulating it as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), to better understand and tackle challenges associated with dynamic access policies. Leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques, our approach optimizes sporadic traffic patterns, crafting an adaptable access policy to maximize both network throughput and energy efficiency under the battery constraint. Simulation results show that proposed DRLMA scheme outperforms traditional access schemes and existing access protocols in sporadic traffic in terms of the energy efficiency, throughput and network life time."

The social ability of an agent is exercised in a multi-agent system (MAS), which constitutes a collection of such agents. Current multi-agent systems mostly work in complex, open, and dynamic environments. In an open environment, many facts, such as domain constraints, agent number, and agent relationships, are not fixed. That brings a lot of difficulties to coordinate agents’ interactions and cooperation. One major problem that impedes agent interaction is that most current agent interaction protocols are not very suitable for open environments. In this chapter, we introduce an approach to ameliorate agent interactions from two perspectives. First, the approach can enable agents to form knowledge “rich” interaction protocols by using ontologies. Second, we use coloured Petri net (CPN) based methods to enable agents to form interaction protocols dynamically, which are more suitable for agent interaction under open environments.

INTRODUCTION It is beyond dispute that multi-agent systems are one of the most important design concepts for today’s software. A multi-agent system (MAS) is a computational system that constitutes a collection of intelligent agents. An intelligent agent is a reactive, proactive, autonomous, and social entity, which performs a given task using information gleaned from its environment. In general, intelligent agents possess four major properties (Rao & Georgeff, 1992): • Reactivity — agents can perceive their environment and respond in a timely fashion to changes that occur in it; • Pro-activity — agents not only can simply act in response to their environments, but also are able to exhibit goal-directed behaviours by taking the initiative; • Autonomy — agents have some level of self-control ability, and they can operate without the direct intervention of humans; and • Social ability — agents interact with other agents. The social ability of an agent is exercised in an MAS. An MAS can be considered as a society of agents that live and work together. In such a multi-agent society, interactions between agents are unavoidable (Lesser, 1999). The interaction between agents occurs when an agent has some intentions and has decided to satisfy these through influencing other agents. Agent interactions are established through exchanging messages that specify the desired performatives of other agents and declarative representations of the contents of messages. The messages exchanged among agents are composed in agent communication languages (ACLs), such as Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML) (Finin, Labrou, & Mayfield, 1997) and the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA) ACL (FIPA, 2004). In addition, messages exchanged between agents need to follow some standard patterns, which are described in agent interaction protocols (Cranefield, Purvis, Nowostawski, & Hwang, 2002). As the application domains of MASs are getting more and more complex, many current agent interaction protocols exhibit some limitations that impede MAS implementations. Firstly, many current application domains of MASs require agents to work in changing and uncertain (open) environments. In such environments, interactions between agents may be influenced by some unexpected factors, such as unexpected messages, loss of messages, or deviation in the message order. Most current agent interaction protocols lack mechanisms to handle these unexpected factors. Secondly, agent architectures in some MASs are heterogeneous, and different agents may possess different interaction protocols. Therefore, due to the heterogeneity, when an agent initialises an interaction with others, it cannot guarantee that its interaction protocol can be understood and accepted by other agents. Thirdly, most agents are hard-coded using interaction protocols, which leads to problems. More specifically, issues such as when to use a particular protocol, what information to transmit, what order to execute tasks, and so on, are left to agent designers. This feature reduces the flexibility of the agent interactions because protocols are hard to modify at runtime once they are pre-coded into the agents. Finally, many current interaction protocols, such as KQML, are not specifically designed to carry knowledge. This kind of knowledge “poor” (Lesser, 1998) protocol is not suitable for applications that need 14 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the \"Add to Cart\" button on the publisher's webpage: www.igi-global.com/chapter/coordinating-agent-interactionsunder-open/4673"

      "abstract": "By combining distributed generation, battery storage, and smart meters, microgrid performance can be enhanced. As a result, distributed energy resources (DER) can be intelligently controlled via online platforms. Through integration, prosumers that use decentralized resources like wind power have replaced conventional power customers. Due to the growth and digitalization of the power distribution infrastructure, a new method of exchanging electricity in community microgrids called peer-to-peer (P2P) intratrading has emerged. Blockchain technology is used because it is transparent, secure, and completes transactions quickly. Prosumers, consumers, and owners of renewable energy sources may now trade energy more easily amongst one another. This study develops the P2P paradigm to create a self-sufficient community microgrid system for trading energy. Incorporating peer-to-peer energy trades and a battery backup system, the suggested technique uses blockchain to simulate a decentralized microgrid energy market. The microgrid P2P market's clearing price is established by taking into account customers' expected reactions to price changes, incentivizing consumers and prosumers to alter their patterns of energy usage. A cryptocurrency called Cosmos that is mined and distributed using blockchain technology is also included in the P2P market idea. The results show how automated P2P commerce and adjustable energy storage enable end users to save energy and become more independent. This paper provides a sustainable microgrid energy market model and suggests an approach to improve security by incorporating blockchain technology into current energy management systems. In summary, the paper offers a design paradigm for an independent microgrid system that makes use of distributed energy sources. It demonstrates how end users may gain from energy efficiency and independence while highlighting the possibilities of P2P energy trade and storage variety offered by blockchain. This thorough method provides information on creating a sustainable microgrid energy market and illustrates how blockchain technology can be used to increase the safety of energy management systems."

      "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) is regarded as a next-generation wave of Information Technology (IT) after the widespread emergence of the Internet and mobile communication technologies. IoT supports information exchange and networked interaction of appliances, vehicles and other objects, making sensing and actuation possible in a low-cost and smart manner. \n  \nOn the other hand, cyber-physical systems (CPS) are described as the engineered systems which are built upon the tight integration of the cyber entities (e.g., computation, communication, and control) and the physical things (natural and man-made systems governed by the laws of physics). \n  \nThe IoT and CPS are not isolated technologies. Rather it can be said that IoT is the base or enabling technology for CPS and CPS is considered as the grownup development of IoT, completing the IoT notion and vision. Both are merged into closed-loop, providing mechanisms for conceptualizing, and realizing all aspects of the networked composed systems that are monitored and controlled by computing algorithms and are tightly coupled among users and the Internet. That is, the hardware and the software entities are intertwined, and they typically function on different time and location-based scales. In fact, the linking between the cyber and the physical world is enabled by IoT (through sensors and actuators). CPS that includes traditional embedded and control systems are supposed to be transformed by the evolving and innovative methodologies and engineering of IoT. \n  \nSeveral applications areas of IoT and CPS are smart building, smart transport, automated vehicles, smart cities, smart grid, smart manufacturing, smart agriculture, smart healthcare, smart supply chain and logistics, etc. \nThough CPS and IoT have significant overlaps, they differ in terms of engineering aspects. Engineering IoT systems revolves around the uniquely identifiable and internet-connected devices and embedded systems; whereas engineering CPS requires a strong emphasis on the relationship between computation aspects (complex software) and the physical entities (hardware). \n  \nEngineering CPS is challenging because there is no defined and fixed boundary and relationship between the cyber and physical worlds. In CPS, diverse constituent parts are composed and collaborated together to create unified systems with global behaviour. These systems need to be ensured in terms of dependability, safety, security, efficiency, and adherence to real‐time constraints. Hence, designing CPS requires knowledge of multidisciplinary areas such as sensing technologies, distributed systems, pervasive and ubiquitous computing, real-time computing, computer networking, control theory, signal processing, embedded systems, etc. \n  \nCPS, along with the continuous evolving IoT, has posed several challenges. For example, the enormous amount of data collected from the physical things makes it difficult for Big Data management and analytics that includes data normalization, data aggregation, data mining, pattern extraction and information visualization. Similarly, the future IoT and CPS need standardized abstraction and architecture that will allow modular designing and engineering of IoT and CPS in global and synergetic applications. Another challenging concern of IoT and CPS is the security and reliability of the components and systems. \n  \nAlthough IoT and CPS have attracted the attention of the research communities and several ideas and solutions are proposed, there are still huge possibilities for innovative propositions to make IoT and CPS vision successful. The major challenges and research scopes include system design and implementation, computing and communication, system architecture and integration, application-based implementations, fault tolerance, designing efficient algorithms and protocols, availability and reliability, security and privacy, energy-efficiency and sustainability, etc. \n  \nIt is our great privilege to present Volume 21, Issue 3 of Scalable Computing: Practice and Experience. We had received 30 research papers and out of which 14 papers are selected for publication. The objective of this special issue is to explore and report recent advances and disseminate state-of-the-art research related to IoT, CPS and the enabling and associated technologies. The special issue will present new dimensions of research to researchers and industry professionals with regard to IoT and CPS. \n  \nVivek Kumar Prasad and Madhuri D Bhavsar in the paper titled \"Monitoring and Prediction of SLA for IoT based Cloud described the mechanisms for monitoring by using the concept of reinforcement learning and prediction of the cloud resources, which forms the critical parts of cloud expertise in support of controlling and evolution of the IT resources and has been implemented using LSTM. The proper utilization of the resources will generate revenues to the provider and also increases the trust factor of the provider of cloud services. For experimental analysis, four parameters have been used i.e. CPU utilization, disk read/write throughput and memory utilization. \n  \nKasture et al. in the paper titled \"Comparative Study of Speaker Recognition Techniques in IoT Devices for Text Independent Negative Recognition\" compared the performance of features which are used in state of art speaker recognition models and analyse variants of Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC) predominantly used in feature extraction which can be further incorporated and used in various smart devices. \n  \nMahesh Kumar Singh and Om Prakash Rishi in the paper titled \"Event Driven Recommendation System for E-Commerce using Knowledge based Collaborative Filtering Technique\" proposed a novel system that uses a knowledge base generated from knowledge graph to identify the domain knowledge of users, items, and relationships among these, knowledge graph is a labelled multidimensional directed graph that represents the relationship among the users and the items. The proposed approach uses about 100 percent of users' participation in the form of activities during navigation of the web site. Thus, the system expects under the users' interest that is beneficial for both seller and buyer. The proposed system is compared with baseline methods in area of recommendation system using three parameters: precision, recall and NDGA through online and offline evaluation studies with user data and it is observed that proposed system is better as compared to other baseline systems. \n  \nBenbrahim et al. in the paper titled \"Deep Convolutional Neural Network with TensorFlow and Keras to Classify Skin Cancer\" proposed a novel classification model to classify skin tumours in images using Deep Learning methodology and the proposed system was tested on HAM10000 dataset comprising of 10,015 dermatoscopic images and the results observed that the proposed system is accurate in order of 94.06\\% in validation set and 93.93\\% in the test set. \n  \nDevi B et al. in the paper titled \"Deadlock Free Resource Management Technique for IoT-Based Post Disaster Recovery Systems\" proposed a new class of techniques that do not perform stringent testing before allocating the resources but still ensure that the system is deadlock-free and the overhead is also minimal. The proposed technique suggests reserving a portion of the resources to ensure no deadlock would occur. The correctness of the technique is proved in the form of theorems. The average turnaround time is approximately 18\\% lower for the proposed technique over Banker's algorithm and also an optimal overhead of O(m). \n  \nDeep et al. in the paper titled \"Access Management of User and Cyber-Physical Device in DBAAS According to Indian IT Laws Using Blockchain\" proposed a novel blockchain solution to track the activities of employees managing cloud. Employee authentication and authorization are managed through the blockchain server. User authentication related data is stored in blockchain. The proposed work assists cloud companies to have better control over their employee's activities, thus help in preventing insider attack on User and Cyber-Physical Devices. \n  \nSumit Kumar and Jaspreet Singh in paper titled \"Internet of Vehicles (IoV) over VANETS: Smart and Secure Communication using IoT\" highlighted a detailed description of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) with current applications, architectures, communication technologies, routing protocols and different issues. The researchers also elaborated research challenges and trade-off between security and privacy in area of IoV. \n  \nDeore et al. in the paper titled \"A New Approach for Navigation and Traffic Signs Indication Using Map Integrated Augmented Reality for Self-Driving Cars\" proposed a new approach to supplement the technology used in self-driving cards for perception. The proposed approach uses Augmented Reality to create and augment artificial objects of navigational signs and traffic signals based on vehicles location to reality. This approach help navigate the vehicle even if the road infrastructure does not have very good sign indications and marking. The approach was tested locally by creating a local navigational system and a smartphone based augmented reality app. The approach performed better than the conventional method as the objects were clearer in the frame which made it each for the object detection to detect them. \n  \nBhardwaj et al. in the paper titled \"A Framework to Systematically Analyse the Trustworthiness of Nodes for Securing IoV Interactions\" performed literature on IoV and Trust and proposed a Hybrid Trust model that seperates the malicious and trusted nodes to secure the interaction of vehicle in IoV. To test the model, simulation was conducted on varied threshold values. And results observed that PDR of trusted node is 0.63 which is higher as compared to PDR of malicious node which is 0.15. And on the basis of PDR, number of available hops and Trust Dynamics the malic"

      "abstract": "It is our great pleasure to welcome you to BADS 2009, the Workshop on Bio-Inspired Algorithms for Distributed Systems. The aim of the workshop is to provide a forum to explore the applications of bio-inspired algorithms and protocols in different kinds of distributed computing systems, and discuss the main trends and challenges for the next few years. \n \nComputer systems are characterized by an ever growing complexity and a pronounced distributed nature. While the use of centralized or hierarchical architectures and algorithms has been dominant so far, they are now becoming impractical because they have poor scalability and fault-tolerance characteristics. Decentralized architectures and algorithms, for example P2P and Grid systems, are increasingly popular, but to be efficiently managed they need new types of algorithms. \n \nBio-inspired algorithms are proving effective in this context, as they can be used to solve hard parallel and distributed computational problems by imitating the autonomic nature of distributed systems, in this way achieving fault-tolerant and self-adaptive behavior. These algorithms can be inspired by a number of biological systems, including ant colonies, bird flocking, honey bees, bacteria, and many more. In other cases the adopted techniques are \"evolutionary\", as they exploit genetic rules for the selection and the recombination of candidate solutions. \n \nThe success of this workshop confirms that distributed computing systems are a very natural application field for bio-inspired algorithms and protocols. The BADS workshop includes one invited paper and 11 research papers selected through an accurate review process, which allowed us to select among 20 manuscripts submitted from Africa, Asia, Brazil, United States and many European Countries. \n \nThe workshop is organized in four sessions, with the papers grouped according to the application area on which the bio-inspired algorithms are exploited. The four sessions are dedicated, respectively, to Grid computing, distributed systems and P2P, sensor and wireless environments, and parallel architectures. \n \nGrid Computing. Four papers are specifically dedicated to Grid computing. The paper by Gonzalez et al. analyzes the behavior of Parallel Genetic Programming (PGP) applications executing in distributed platforms with high failure rates, with the goal of characterizing the inherent fault tolerance capabilities of the PGP paradigm. Two well-known GP problems, \"even parity 5\" and \"11-multiplexer\", are examined via simulation by using trace data collected from real-world Desktop Grid platforms. Experiments show that the PGP paradigm exhibits satisfying fault tolerance properties even in very dynamic environments. \n \nThe paper by Brocco et al. presents and evaluates an ant-inspired algorithm that aims to reduce the overall network traffic in a Grid. Mobile agents move across the Grid and add or remove logical links exploiting local information, in order to optimize the network topology. The paper also introduces an effective resource discovery algorithm that executes over the obtained topology and uses cache information exchanged among the nodes via a gossiping mechanism. \n \nThe paper by Brun and Medvidovic shows how the natural process of crystal growth can inspire computational mechanisms that are easily susceptible to large-scale parallelization, fault tolerance, and uniform representation of data and computation, which favors data management and mobility. After summarizing the crystal-inspired solutions to some complex problems, for example the SubsetSum NP-complete problem, the authors describe how these techniques can also be devised for distributed systems and specifically computational Grids. The proposed approach ensures scalability, privacy of data, and tolerance of a wide range of faults and malicious attacks. \n \nDe Falco et al. propose the use of a multi-objective Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm that finds near-optimal solutions to map the communicating tasks of a computational intensive application on multisite Grid nodes. The authors extend the classical DE paradigm to cope with this problem, also by introducing a novel operator that allows a subset of similar tasks to be allocated on the nodes of a cluster. The algorithm is defined, implemented and evaluated in many simulated scenarios by varying the load and reliability of the nodes, so reproducing a real world environment. \n \nDistributed Systems and P2P. Three papers focus on general purpose distributed systems and P2P networks. The paper by Korosec and Silic proposes a distributed ant-colony optimization technique to solve black-box global optimization problems. Prior to the application of the distributed ant algorithm, the problem space is discretized and a search graph of the problem is built. The algorithm exhibits good scalability properties in the scenarios where the black-box execution time dominates the time taken by the ants to search the global optimum. Scalability can be further improved by using a larger number of ants. \n \nOhnishi et al. use an evolutionary-based approach to adaptively change the topology of a dynamic P2P network and improve the reliability of search procedures. The topology of the network is conveniently represented as an individual of the evolutionary algorithm, and crossover and mutation operator are used to change the network topology. The algorithm is evaluated on two different scenarios, with and without replicating the resources: the evolutionary approach proves to be particularly effective without replication. \n \nThe paper by Bicocchi et al. aims to handle dynamics in diffusive aggregation schemas using a technique based on a classical gossiping technique and on a novel method named \"evaporation\". The latter is based on the search behavior of ants following pheromone trails, and tends to promote up-to-date values while making old values evaporate. The method avoids the need for periodic restarts present in standard gossiping techniques. Experimental results assess the efficiency of the method especially for large-scale networks. \n \nSensor and Wireless Networks. This session collects three papers that focus on sensor and wireless networks and, more specifically, deal with the important issue of energy saving. The invited paper by Hernandez and Blum discusses and analyzes a self-organizing mechanism that exploits the energy harvesting capabilities of a network of mobile sensors. The mechanism is inspired by the self-synchronized sleeping patterns observed in ant colonies. Correspondingly, each sensor switches between the active and the inactive state on the basis of its state parameters, the amount of energy harvested with its solar cells, and the information received by neighbor sensors. The approach is evaluated in conditions that are easily encountered in real world applications, such as de-synchronized sensor clocks, random direction mobility of sensors, and varying weather conditions influencing the amount of solar energy collected by the sensors. \n \nGarbinato et al. present a novel approach to disseminating information in a sensor network. This approach combines the decentralized and stateless properties of gossiping protocols, which assure low resource consumption, with the high reliability that is typical of structured protocols. Reliability is obtained by modulating the transmission range of sensors in accordance with a power law statistical distribution. If compared with classical gossiping protocols, the small-world and scale-free nature of the presented approach allows sensors to obtain equivalent delivery ratios with lower energy consumption. \n \nDe Rango and Tropea present a routing algorithm for mobile ad hoc networks. This algorithm utilizes swarm intelligence techniques, in particular an ant colony optimization algorithm, to discover minimum drain rate paths, so combining traffic load balancing and energy saving. The main novelty of the approach consists in using quantitative metrics for energy saving and traffic load distribution in the pheromone update phase. The algorithm efficiency is proved through comparison, via NS2 simulation, with two currently adopted routing algorithms. \n \nParallel Architectures. The session on algorithms for parallel architectures comprises two papers that exploit innovative techniques: algorithms for GPU-based architectures and DNA computing algorithms. Robilliard et al. analyze the possibilities offered by modern Graphics Processing Units (GPU) for implementing genetic programming. They evaluate and compare the performance of GP obtained by using two parallelization schemas, namely BlockGP and ThreadGP. The paper draws some important lessons for optimizing evolutionary algorithms on GPU-based architectures. \n \nIn their paper, Iaccarino and Mazza propose a performance improvement of a recent DNA computing algorithm. This method is applied to an intractable problem in the field of cryptography, the \"elliptic curve discrete logarithm\" problem. In particular, the authors build the model of a parallel multiplier and adder, which outperforms the existing methods in terms of the worst case time complexity. \n \nThe categorization of the workshop papers in accordance with the corresponding application domains clearly confirms the wide range of practical applications that may benefit from the adoption of bio-inspired algorithms, and the inherent capacity of these algorithms to be exploited in emerging domains such as sensor networks, Grids, P2P networks, and multi-core processors."

These systems demonstrate exceptional capabilities in coordinating autonomous agents for sophisticated problem-solving across various domains. From enterprise operations to smart infrastructure management, MAS implementations have revolutionized traditional approaches through enhanced coordination mechanisms and adaptive learning capabilities. The integration of machine learning and advanced communication protocols has enabled unprecedented levels of system flexibility and resilience. In industrial applications, these systems have transformed manufacturing processes, supply chain operations, and resource management through intelligent automation and real-time optimization. Looking forward, emerging trends in self-organizing systems, ethical decision frameworks, and collective learning mechanisms suggest even greater potential for advancement. The continuous evolution of MAS technology promises to further enhance distributed intelligence capabilities while addressing critical challenges in security, scalability, and system adaptation."

      "abstract": "Multi-agent systems represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, enabling complex problem-solving through coordinated specialized agents. However, these systems face fundamental challenges in context management, coordination efficiency, and scalable operation. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for advancing multi-agent systems through Model Context Protocol (MCP), addressing these challenges through standardized context sharing and coordination mechanisms. We extend previous work on AI agent architectures by developing a unified theoretical foundation, advanced context management techniques, and scalable coordination patterns. Through detailed implementation case studies across enterprise knowledge management, collaborative research, and distributed problem-solving domains, we demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to traditional approaches. Our evaluation methodology provides a systematic assessment framework with benchmark tasks and datasets specifically designed for multi-agent systems. We identify current limitations, emerging research opportunities, and potential transformative applications across industries. This work contributes to the evolution of more capable, collaborative, and context-aware artificial intelligence systems that can effectively address complex real-world challenges."

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of secure consensus tracking control for nonlinear leader-follower multi-agent systems, with a specific focus on safeguarding followers’ private information from external network eavesdroppers or internal untrusted neighbors. To tackle this problem, we first employ the dynamic linearization approximation technique to transform the nonlinear system models into equivalent linear forms that involve unknown time-varying pseudopartial derivatives. Then, a novel model-free secure distributed adaptive control (MFSDAC) framework is proposed using an encoding-decoding mechanism and Paillier encryption. Within this framework, we develop a secure distributed control scheme using a recursive form and design an adaptive updating law with a modified projection to estimate the time-varying pseudoparial derivatives. To enhance security, we introduce an adjustable parameter and a random integer into the distributed communication protocol, effectively preventing the disclosure of followers’ data during both network transmissions and controller evaluations. Additionally, parameter selection rules for the controller, quantizer, and adaptive updating law are provided, along with convergence analysis and guarantees against quantizer saturation. Finally, numerical simulations confirm that the proposed MFSDAC framework successfully achieves leader-following tracking and secure data transmission, even in the presence of external network eavesdroppers or internal untrusted neighbors. Note to Practitioners—Multi-agent systems (MASs) provide a versatile framework for modeling and understanding various real-world applications, including autonomous systems, traffic management, and distributed sensor networks. Designing effective control strategies for MASs is essential to enhance cooperation and coordination among agents, strengthen system-level resilience and adaptability, and tackle complex tasks that surpass the capabilities of individual agents. A key challenge in this area is ensuring network security and protecting individual privacy, especially in the presence of external eavesdroppers and untrusted internal neighbors. To tackle this challenge, we propose a model-free secure distributed adaptive control framework for nonlinear leader-follower MASs. This framework incorporates a confidential communication protocol that leverages homomorphic encryption to protect sensitive information. The proposed framework has undergone rigorous stability analysis and been validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness in achieving secure consensus control of nonlinear MASs."

Agent-based modeling (ABM) as a bottom-up modeling approach considers a network of autonomous agents interacting with each other, and therefore represents an ideal framework to comprehend the interactions of heterogeneous nodes in a complex environment. Here, we investigate the suitability of ABM to model the communication aspects of a road traffic management system as an example of an IoT network. We model, analyze, and compare various medium access control (MAC) layer protocols for two different scenarios, namely uncoordinated and coordinated. Besides, we model the scheduling mechanisms for the coordinated scenario as a high-level MAC protocol by using three different approaches: 1) centralized decision maker (DM); 2) DESYNC; and 3) decentralized learning MAC (L-MAC). The results clearly show the importance of coordination between multiple DMs in order to improve the information reporting error and spectrum utilization of the system."

      "abstract": "In this study, we address the challenge of time-varying formation control in multi-agent systems (MASs) in the presence of time-varying intra- and inter-agent communication delays. To tackle time-varying delays, we equip each agent with a bank of distributed observers to estimate its own and its neighbors’ states. We apply dynamic periodic event-triggered mechanisms to both sensor-to-observer (S-O) and controller-to-actuator (C-A) channels, aiming to reduce unnecessary data transmissions in the network by relying on locally triggered sampled data in a distributed fashion to enhance resource efficiency. In the design stage, we transform the state formation control problem into an asymptotic stability problem. Using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) approach, we design the event-triggering parameters such that the closed-loop system of all agents is stable and agents reach the desired formation. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our approach achieves a balance by reducing inter-agent communication frequency while maintaining the desired formation. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of this approach through experiments on a real-world robotic system. Note to Practitioners—In practical applications of multi-agent systems, the use of a communication network introduces some challenging issues. To name a few, periodic sampling with a high frequency relies on heavy transmission of information between components, which may result in network congestion. Factors such as limited bandwidth, signal attenuation, and packet losses contribute to delays in networked MAS. Additionally, network security, protocols, buffering, processing, and transmission times play significant roles. Since network-induced delays depend heavily on variable network conditions, they are generally non-uniform and time-varying. This paper proposes a solution for formation control in MASs, considering communication delays, and holds practical implications across various industries. It can enhance coordination for tasks such as warehouse logistics and collaborative manufacturing in autonomous robotics. Drone swarms can benefit from more efficient and reliable movement coordination, impacting surveillance and precision agriculture. In industrial automation, synchronization among machines or robotic arms can be improved for increased efficiency. A noteworthy aspect of this paper is the validation of our results through experiments on a real-world multi-robot system, demonstrating broad applicability."

      "abstract": "An increasing number of emerging applications, e.g., internet of things, vehicular communications, augmented reality, and the growing complexity due to the interoperability requirements of these systems, lead to the need to change the tools used for the modeling and analysis of those networks. Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) as a bottom-up modeling approach considers a network of autonomous agents interacting with each other, and therefore represents an ideal framework to comprehend the interactions of heterogeneous nodes in a complex environment. Here, we investigate the suitability of ABM to model the communication aspects of a road traffic management system, as an example of an Internet of Things (IoT) network. We model, analyze and compare various Medium Access Control (MAC) layer protocols for two different scenarios, namely uncoordinated and coordinated. Besides, we model the scheduling mechanisms for the coordinated scenario as a high level MAC protocol by using three different approaches: Centralized Decision Maker, DESYNC and decentralized learning MAC (L-MAC). The results clearly show the importance of coordination between multiple decision makers in order to improve the accuracy of information and spectrum utilization of the system."

      "abstract": "This paper studies the generic architecture and coordination mechanism of an FIPA (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents) compliant heterogeneous multi-agent system (MAS) in a distributed control scenario. Proposed generic MAS framework has been applied to a real-time traffic detection and management system. The agent-based real-time traffic detection and management system (ABRTTDMS) is designed for the information fusion of different traffic detection systems on highways to optimize real-time traffic detection and management. ABRTTDMS is a multi-level agent system. The lowest level agents are responsible for processing the real-time traffic data and monitoring traffic conditions. The middle level agents coordinate all of the lowest level agents in a subnetwork. The highest-level agent is located in the transportation management center (TMC) to accept human commands and delegate tasks to lower level agents. The re-configurable hybrid control architecture of the system provides the capability of dynamically grouping distributed heterogeneous agents (intelligent control systems) into virtual clusters to accomplish tasks related to different geographical areas and different purposes. A platform independent agent execution engine has been implemented using an embeddable C/C++ interpreter called Ch. The communication between agents that reside on different hosts has been simulated in the Integration Engineering Laboratory at the University of California, Davis. The use of agent technology greatly enhances the distributed computing and cooperation capabilities of traffic detection and management systems.Copyright © 2004 by ASME"

      "abstract": "The rise of large model-based AI agents has spurred interest in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for their capabilities in decision-making, collaboration, and adaptability. While the Model Context Protocol (MCP) addresses tool invocation and data exchange challenges via a unified protocol, it lacks support for organizing agent-level collaboration. To bridge this gap, we propose Agent-as-a-Service based on Agent Network (AaaS-AN), a service-oriented paradigm grounded in the Role-Goal-Process-Service (RGPS) standard. AaaS-AN unifies the entire agent lifecycle, including construction, integration, interoperability, and networked collaboration, through two core components: (1) a dynamic Agent Network, which models agents and agent groups as vertexes that self-organize within the network based on task and role dependencies; (2) service-oriented agents, incorporating service discovery, registration, and interoperability protocols. These are orchestrated by a Service Scheduler, which leverages an Execution Graph to enable distributed coordination, context tracking, and runtime task management. We validate AaaS-AN on mathematical reasoning and application-level code generation tasks, which outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, we constructed a MAS based on AaaS-AN containing agent groups, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) workflows, and MCP servers over 100 agent services. We also release a dataset containing 10,000 long-horizon multi-agent workflows to facilitate future research on long-chain collaboration in MAS."

      "abstract": "In the realm of Natural Disaster Management (NDM), timely communication with local authorities is paramount for an effective response. To achieve this, multi-agent systems play a pivotal role by proficiently identifying and categorizing various disasters. In the field of Distributed Deep Neural Network (D-DNN) inference, such approaches often require DNN nodes to transmit their results to the cloud for inference, or they necessitate the establishment of a fixed topology network to enable inference directly on the edge, a practice prone to security risks. In this work, we propose a decentralized inference strategy tailored for fire classification tasks. In this approach, individual DNN nodes communicate within a network and enhance their predictions by considering other DNN node inference outputs that contribute to improving their individual performance. The overall coordination of the system on a specific decision is achieved through a consensus protocol, which acts as a universally accepted inference rule adopted by all DNN nodes operating within the system. We present a comprehensive experimental analysis, of the forest-fire classification task, focusing on enhancing both individual DNN node performance and the stability of the consensus protocol."

Consequently, the legacy energy distribution system faces many challenges in supporting grid stability, reliability, efficiency, and security under this transition setting. Herein, we adopt a quantitative text analysis of 310 articles complemented by a qualitative review to identify how and to what extent the fourth industrial revolution reflects in the energy distribution system. To this end, we map the literature for the technological innovations that support condition-based maintenance of electricity distribution grid under the Industry 4.0 principles. We emphasize how physical asset management enabled by the Industry 4.0 principles, i.e., interconnection, information transparency, automation, decentralized decisions and sustainability, can become a source of competitive advantage for utilities. This study helps place the physical assets portfolio at the core of strategic decisions aimed at attaining a more sustainable state, operational excellence, and economic prosperity."

      "abstract": "With the unexpectedly fluctuating price of oil and the increasing threat of global climate change, Electric Vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy, particularly photovoltaic (PV) generation are becoming a viable option since they are not directly affected by the unstable oil price and yet are environmentally friendly. The PV generation has attracted attention in the “Solar Belt” countries, especially in Qatar where annual mean of global solar radiation (around 2000 kWh/m2/year) is large. The ample roof space on large residential and commercial buildings in Qatar and ability of the PV panel covers to protect vehicles from the exposure to sunshine makes the use of PV generation a natural choice. When connected to the grid, EV battery can behave as mobile energy storage making EV capable of either charging via grid-to-vehicle (G2V) as a “load” or discharging via vehicle-to-grid (V2G) or vehicle-to-building (V2B) as a “generator” or a dispatchable “back-up storage”. This bi-directional power flow feature provides flexibility needed to match variability of the renewable sources. The integration of electric vehicles and PV generation achieves two goals: a) it displaces the urban tailpipe pollution to the location where the power plants are, which typically in rural areas, and b) it allows energy storage when solar generation is active, which is mostly during the day, and discharging during the night, which allows better control of the generation variability. The objective of this paper is to discuss the methodology and technology needed to coordinate EVs' charging and PV-based generation in order to improve the performance of electric grid and at the same time reduce the environmental pollution. The paper focuses on three issues: a) integration of photovoltaic (PV) generation and EV charging stations through DC or AC bus, b) interfacing the DC or AC bus to the power system using advanced power electronics, and c) analysis of the impacts of the PVs and EVs on the power grid operation. The integration and interfacing will be optimized to support several utility applications: demand side management, outage management and asset management. The different modes of interfacing and integrating EVs and PVs into the grid are defined under different scenarios. As an example, the demand side management analysis scenarios under different power grid conditions are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. When power grid demand is low, and the valley filling is needed, EVs can be put into charging via G2V mode and combined with PV generation to keep the power balance between supply and demand, as shown in Fig. 1. When power grid suffers from the peak load and load shaving is needed, EVs can be turned to V2G mode, and combined with PV generation can be utilized to help relieve the demand burden, as shown in Fig. 2. A local battery storage may be used to store the extra power generated from PV or abundant energy from the EV battery to act as the grid interface. The potential impact of EV charging/discharging on the power grid demand profile is simulated. How the grid performance will be improved when PV generation is taken into consideration is investigated. With the interfacing of EV energy storage and PV generation, more energy will be available for flexible control to help grid flatten the demand curve and reduce the peak load. Based on the comparison and analysis, the integration and interfacing of EVs and PVs are coordinated to support the demand side management application. Proper power electronic solutions allowing bidirectional power flow with fast charging/discharging is also presented. The approach is toward finding optimal solutions in terms of decreasing the time of charging/discharging and adhering to the international standards related to grid side power quality issues. Many high-frequency AC link inverters have been proposed to realize such interface system in the past. One topology is considered promising. It has a bi-directional power flow feature. The inverter operates by first charging the link from the input and then discharging the stored energy to the output. The link inductor (L) stores the energy and the small capacitor (C) placed in parallel with (L) provides the soft switching. Between each power transfer mode there is a resonant mode at which the link inductor and capacitor resonate and no power is transferred. Despite its merits of having a small inductance size, and flexible multiport feature, this converter has two main drawbacks: a) High filtering needs especially at the input terminals, and b) Poor voltage boosting capabilities. These drawbacks are overcome in our proposed novel configuration shown in Fig. 3. Quasi-Z-Source Inverters (qZSIs) have many attractive advantages that are suitable for applying in PV systems and batteries. The use of qZSIs for this configuration has the following good features: Higher boosting capabilities. Lower harmonic content in input current. No filtering requirements at the input terminals. Features lower component (capacitor) rating. On the other hand, a one more power switch (S0) is added to allow bidirectional flow-in case of battery discharging. According to the battery state of charge, the PV available output power, and the grid availability, the following power flow schemes are possible: I. When PV is online: 1. From PV to Grid, while Battery is offline. 2. From PV to (Grid + Battery). 3. From (PV + Grid) to Battery. 4. From (PV + Battery) to Grid. II. When PV is offline: 5. From Grid to Battery. 6. From Battery to Grid. In case of outage of the power grid, the schemes will be directed to be as follows: I. When PV is online: 7. From PV to local loads, while Battery is offline. 8. From PV to (local loads+ Battery). 9. From (PV + Battery) to local loads. II. When PV is offline: 10. From Battery to local loads. The analysis of the impact of EVs and PVs on outage management includes establishing the simulation model of the typical outage condition profile, simulating the performance of PV generation to cover the interrupted load and establishing coordination methodology to make the best use of the energy from PVs and EVs. The analysis of the impact on asset management includes establishing the simulation model of the typical asset management process for existing utility assets, simulating the impact of bidirectional flow due to PV generation, and mitigation of negative asset effects such as overloading due to EV charging and establishing coordination algorithm for minimizing the overall impact of the integration of PV and EV. Evaluation of how transformer maintenance can be optimized under the new operating modes will be discussed. The results of the study will not only benefit the placement planning for EV charging stations and roof top PV installations to better utilize the electric grid resources, but will also benefit the power grid operation especially the distribution system creating positive environmental impacts paving the road for future large-scale integration of the smart grid flexible load technology in Qatar."

Loose coupling between services, asynchronous communication, and regional event propagation strategies contribute to systems capable of handling continuous streams of ride requests, driver location updates, and payment transactions. The proposed classification system for events by criticality and regional affinity enables intelligent routing and processing decisions. Properly implemented event-driven architectures significantly enhance system scalability during demand surges while maintaining operational resilience through service isolation and regional redundancy. A detailed case study of a production ride-sharing platform identifies key implementation challenges including eventual consistency management, regional data sovereignty, and observability in distributed environments. The work provides both theoretical foundations and practical guidance for engineers designing next-generation transportation systems and other high-volume, geographically distributed applications requiring real-time event coordination."

      "abstract": "The core technology of Vehicle Infrastructure Cooperative System (VICS) has progressed to a “cooperative perception” phase, which necessitates an efficient, reliable and cost-effective information sharing mechanism. However, existing approaches are insufficient to meet the requirements due to a number of critical issues. Firstly, data structures specified according to applications are unable to accommodate system dynamics. Secondly, the lack of open and common protocols and interfaces across heterogenous and distributed systems may lead to severe problems related to data integrity and redundancy. Thirdly, centralized data aggregation not only confronts with limited storage and network congestion, but is also a single point of failure. To address these issues, we propose a novel semantically enhanced architectural layer, Global Wagon Web (GWW), which is a service-oriented and fully decentralized infrastructure to enable live data integration, service reuse and composition, and semantic interoperation within the context of VICS. To illustrate its natures, relevant concepts and forms of structural and behavioral algebraic descriptions are presented with the help of Petri net. Additionally, its key supporting technologies and potential applications are outlined."

While open-source benchmarks exist, they do not capture the full complexity of cloud services. Application cloning is a promising way to address this, however, prior work is limited to CPU-/cache-centric, single-node services, operating at user level. We present Ditto, an automated framework for cloning end-to-end cloud applications, both monolithic and microservices, which captures I/O and network activity, as well as kernel operations, in addition to application logic. Ditto takes a hierarchical approach to application cloning, starting with capturing the dependency graph across distributed services, to recreating each tier's control/data flow, and finally generating system calls and assembly that mimics the individual applications. Ditto does not reveal the logic of the original application, facilitating publicly sharing clones of production services with hardware vendors, cloud providers, and the research community. We show that across a diverse set of single- and multi-tier applications, Ditto accurately captures their CPU and memory characteristics as well as their high-level performance metrics, is portable across platforms, and facilitates a wide range of system studies."

      "abstract": "Massive garbage patches within all oceanic gyres have garnered global attention, underscoring microplastic pollution as an emerging concern. Various isolated approaches have been proposed for real-time monitoring of microplastics in environmental and industrial settings. However, these fragmented solutions may hinder distributed data and knowledge sharing across applications, limiting the potential for leveraging AI development to enhance early warning systems and decision-making in large-scale industrial operations. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a framework that utilizes Planetary Digital Twins (PDTs) and affordable modular flow cytometry tools. These innovations enable the real-time tracking and sharing of data on microplastic pollution, tracing their origins from polymer-based industrial processes to their presence in the environment. The proposed framework includes a distributed system architecture based on publisher/subscriber for robust and scalable data sharing. By integrating Industry 5.0 principles, which prioritize sustainability and resilient production processes, the digital twin technology enables a dynamic and interconnected monitoring network. The validation results suggest that the proposed system has the potential to expand and enhance environmental risk assessments on a global scale and support the development of mitigation strategies through improved data integration and sharing capabilities for microplastic monitoring."

However, existing centralized solutions face limitations in scalability, latency, and data privacy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a blockchain-based distributed data-sharing and access control system tailored for resource-constrained industrial edge networks. The system adopts a three-layer architecture that integrates edge computing and blockchain technology to provide decentralized, low-latency data management. A novel smart contract framework is introduced to enforce multi-level access control and support fine-grained permissions for intra-domain and cross-domain data sharing. Experimental results show the system's improved performance in data access efficiency and throughput, offering a robust solution for real-time, secure IIoT applications."

The basic approach to the proposed system is to create a trustworthy and secure platform that enables doctors to safely store, access, and manage patients' private medical information while abiding by stringent privacy laws to protect patient confidentiality. Data that has been separated into blocks can be distributed because of to the decentralized system. Then, every block is shielded against hackers trying to change the data. All of the network's peers, or miners, or users, must validate each modification to the data using modern cryptography techniques. The SECURE - MEDSHARE system uses blockchain technology to store patient data from different hospitals in a decentralized and secure way, overcoming the limitations of local servers. In an era where data privacy and security are paramount, this Proposed System presents a pioneering solution leveraging blockchain technology for secure medical data sharing. The system's foundation relies on the decentralized nature of blockchain, implemented through Ethereum and Hardhat for robust smart contract deployment and management. Interactions occur via a user-friendly React frontend, integrating seamlessly with MetaMask for secure blockchain transactions. The Proposed System utilizes IPFS for decentralized file storage, ensuring data integrity and accessibility. Smart contracts play a pivotal role, orchestrating access controls and establishing a transparent framework for healthcare data sharing. This innovative approach promises heightened security, privacy, and efficiency in managing sensitive medical information, catering to the evolving needs of modern health care systems. The system's architecture and functionality align with the growing demand for reliable, decentralized solutions in data-sensitive domains, positioning it as a potential cornerstone in revolutionizing healthcare data management"

      "abstract": "Blockchain technology is transforming the safe sharing and patient data management in a healthcare setting becoming more and more digital. Blockchain's distributed ledger design is challenging conventional centralised systems, often typified by data silos and vulnerability to cyber-attacks. This study offers a complete architecture for blockchain-based health informatics systems guaranteeing data integrity, privacy, and interoperability across many healthcare systems. The suggested system provides a strong solution for automated permission management and safe data exchange by using smart contracts, consensus mechanisms, and cryptographic approaches as well as To effectively manage vast amounts of data while preserving strict security criteria, the architecture combines off-chain storage with on-chain transaction recording. By means of transparent, unchangeable records, and thus build confidence among healthcare professionals, insurance companies, and research organisations, extensive academic analysis and empirical assessments emphasise the potential of blockchain to empower patients. All important for real-time clinical applications, performance benchmarks from pilot tests show gains in transaction throughput, reduced data retrieval latency, and excellent network uptime. Furthermore, the threat modelling and regulatory compliance studies solve important issues around data protection and scalability thus making sure the system fits strict legal frameworks like HIPAA and GDPR. Although perfect integration with legacy systems still presents difficulties, this study highlights the transforming power of blockchain technology in building an interoperable, patient-centric, safe healthcare environment. Future research will concentrate on maximising scalability and improving the regulatory environment to fully exploit blockchain possibilities in health informatics."

      "abstract": "Distributed Ledger technology (DLT) has recently emerged as a disruptive system with a wide range of applicability, with prospect to improve societal interactions at large. In virtual enterprise (VE) context researchers and practitioners have started to investigate the deployment of DLT to automate the processing of data and implementation of decisions to support the provision of digital services. Although academic interest in this domain is growing, a practical analysis of DLT from a governance perspective is still lacking to date. Accordingly, this study aims to fill this gap and provide implications related to decentralized governance of DLT. This article develops an architectural governance-by-design framework that defines the governance of DLT as a combination of architectural layers and governance of DLT dimensions. Design science is employed, and IOTA tangle an open-source DLT which employs a decentralized asynchronous network is deployed to evaluate the applicability of the developed architectural governance-by-design framework through qualitative interviews and literature inquiry. The findings confirm the developed architectural governance-by-design framework and offer a shared discussion and insight surrounding the topic of governance of DLT. The findings also identify limitations associated with governance of DLT solutions and proposes policy recommendations to be used as guidelines for practitioners to improve the adoption of DLT to accelerate VE digitalization."

      "abstract": "Electronic health records (EHRs) play an important role in our life. However, most of the time, they are scattered and saved on different databases belonging to distinct institutions (hospitals, laboratories, clinics, etc.) geographically distributed across one or many countries. Due to this decentralization and the heterogeneity of the different involved systems, medical staff are facing difficulties in correctly collaborating by sharing, protecting, and tracking their patient’s electronic health-record history to provide them with the best care. Additionally, patients have no control over their private EHRs. Blockchain has many promising future uses for the healthcare domain because it provides a better solution for sharing data while preserving the integrity, the interoperability, the availability of the classical client–server architectures used to manage EHRS. This paper proposes a framework called HealthBlock for collaboratively sharing EHRs and their privacy preservation. Different technologies have been combined to achieve this goal. The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) technology stores and shares patients’ EHRs in distributed off-chain storage and ensures the record’s immutability; Hyperledger Indy gives patients full control over their EHRs, and Hyperledger Fabric stores the patient-access control policy and delegations."

      "abstract": "Multi-access edge computing (MEC) enhances service quality for users and reduces computational overhead by migrating workloads and application data to the network edge. However, current solutions for task offloading and cache replacement in edge scenarios are constrained by factors such as communication bandwidth, wireless network coverage, and limited storage capacity of edge devices, making it challenging to achieve high cache reuse and lower system energy consumption. To address these issues, a framework leveraging cooperative edge servers deployed in wireless access networks across different geographical regions is designed. Specifically, we propose the Distributed Edge Service Caching and Offloading (DESCO) network architecture and design a decentralized resource-sharing algorithm based on consistent hashing, named Cache Chord. Subsequently, based on DESCO and aiming to minimize overall user energy consumption while maintaining user latency constraints, we introduce the real-time computation offloading (RCO) problem and transform RCO into a multi-player static game, prove the existence of Nash equilibrium solutions, and solve it using a multi-dimensional particle swarm optimization algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution reduces the average energy consumption by over 27% in the DESCO network compared to existing algorithms."

      "abstract": "Scaling models to large sizes to improve performance has led a trend in deep learning, and sparsely activated Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) is a promising architecture to scale models. However, training MoE models in existing systems is expensive, mainly due to the All-to-All communication between layers. All-to-All communication originates from expert-centric paradigm: keeping experts in-place and exchanging intermediate data to feed experts. We propose the novel data-centric paradigm: keeping data in-place and moving experts between GPUs. Since experts' size can be smaller than the size of data, data-centric paradigm can reduce communication workload. Based on this insight, we develop Janus. First, Janus supports fine-grained asynchronous communication, which can overlap computation and communication. Janus implements a hierarchical communication to further reduce cross-node traffic by sharing the fetched experts in the same machine. Second, when scheduling the \"fetching expert\" requests, Janus implements a topology-aware priority strategy to utilize intra-node and inter-node links efficiently. Finally, Janus allows experts to be prefetched, which allows the downstream computation to start immediately once the previous step completes. Evaluated on a 32-A100 cluster, Janus can reduce the traffic up to 16× and achieves up to 2.06× speedup compared with current MoE training system."

We discuss the benefit and best practices of combining two different frameworks that share the same spirit and show its performance from large-scale real-world experiments. The proposed system is developed as part of Team CoSTAR's effort for the DARPA Subterranean (SubT) Challenge. The system has been field-proved and demonstrated in the Urban Circuit event, where team CoSTAR won first place. To our knowledge, this work is the first real-world demonstration of a ROS 2-based multi-robot system in such large-scale extreme environments. From the significant improvement of the communication performance and the ease of transition from existing ROS 1 systems, this work encourages wider adoption of ROS 2 in field robotics applications."

While many decentralized algorithms focus on \\emph{gossip} communications (pairwise averaging), we consider a different scheme, in which a ``token'' that contains the current estimate of the model performs a random walk over the network, and updates its model using the local model of the node it is at. Indeed, token algorithms generally benefit from improved communication efficiency and privacy guarantees. We frame the token algorithm as a randomized gossip algorithm on a conceptual graph, which allows us to prove a series of convergence results for variance-reduced and accelerated token algorithms for the complete graph. We also extend these results to the case of multiple tokens by extending the conceptual graph, and to general graphs by tweaking the communication procedure. The reduction from token to well-studied gossip algorithms leads to tight rates for many token algorithms, and we illustrate their performance empirically."

In this context, SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems are an essential infrastructure. This paper presents a conceptual design of a communication and resources management scheme based on an intelligent SCADA with a decentralized, flexible, and intelligent approach, adaptive to the context (context awareness). The methodology is used to support the energy resource management considering all the involved costs, power flows, and electricity prices leading to the network reconfiguration. The methodology also addresses the definition of the information access permissions of each player to each resource. The paper includes a 33-bus network used in a case study that considers an intensive use of distributed energy resources in five distinct implemented operation contexts."

This approach couples Quality Function Deployment, elements of the Systems Engineering Process, a centralized or decentralized decision mechanism, and an ongoing performance measurement system. The approach can be applied during conceptual design to eliminate system design solutions that prove to be deficient and/or provide excess capacity. A hypothetical example consisting of a simplified network communication system is presented to illustrate a complete application of the approach. This research shows that the Integrated Decision Approach can be used to resolve certain decision problems that involve publicly shared systems as effectively as the best of the centralized mechanisms but with less time and analysis required. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

      "abstract": "Thousands of drone operations are expected over urban areas in different countries, as drones bring economic and societal benefits. However, it raises problems regarding unmanned traffic management, including safety, regulatory, security, automatization, communication, and scalability aspects. How can we provide decentralized services for drone traffic management that are compliant with the regulatory framework? We identified some requirements from the European U-space regulation and applied the Systems Development Methodology. We devised a permissioned blockchain-based architecture, Services as smart contracts, and a simple consensus mechanism named Appointed-by-Authority as conceptual contributions. The practical one is a working software named U-spaceChain. It is a proof-of-concept of a blockchain in which smart contracts provide Flight Authorization, Network Identification, Traffic Information, Conformance Monitoring, Geo Awareness, Weather Information, and Common Information services. It is compliant with regulations, secure by design, can support the development of new services, and the concepts can be reused in other domains. We also designed enablers that allow testing this proof-of-concept by creation and then simulation of drone traffic. U-spaceChain may be a reference for the research and application of blockchain to the drone traffic management domain."

      "abstract": "In this communication, conceptual design guidelines for a tri-band dual sense circularly polarized ceramic-based antenna is explored. An asymmetrical S-shaped aperture is used to stimulate the ring-shaped ceramic. Some exclusive features are obtained in the designed antenna: (i) creation of five different hybrid modes (HEM11δ , HEM11δ+2, HEM12δ-like, HEM12δ , and HEM13δ) is helpful for getting dual wideband impedance bandwidth; (ii) proposed aperture assists in achieving CP waves in three different frequency ranges with two different senses. Its experimental results confirm the simulated outcomes. The proposed antenna is operated within the dual-frequency ranges, i.e., 2.2–4.19 GHz and 4.74–6.11 GHz, respectively. The measured 3-dB axial ratio is achieved in three different frequency ranges within the operating band, i.e., 2.71–2.98 GHz, 3.6–3.79 GHz, and 5.5–5.81 GHz, respectively. The proposed antenna design is left-handed circularly polarized (LHCP) in the first and third frequency ranges, while it is right-handed in the second one. These features, along with broadsided far-field patterns, recommend the proposed antenna design for potential application in WLAN (2.4/5.5 GHz) and WiMAX (3.3/5.0 GHz) wireless networks."

      "abstract": "Nowadays, society and business rely heavily on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems, which are progressing faster than ever. To stay on pace with them, focus is shifted towards integration of individual ICT systems into complex systems, which offers more functionality than simply the sum of individual systems. In this regard, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) have gained significant importance and System-of-Systems (SoS) approach has been suggested for modeling complex CPSs to achieve a higher level goal, by dynamically building a large system with existing autonomous, and heterogeneous constituent systems (CSs). An important challenge in a system of Cyber-Physical Systems (SoCPSs) is to develop seamless collaboration between autonomous constituent-CPSs (CCPSs) to coordinate their operations. In this paper, we propose an agent based coordination mechanism to coordinate resource allocation and demand in SoCPSs. The approach models each CCPS as an agent and describes how multiple autonomous CCPSs, i.e., Virtual Power Plant (VPP), Commercial Greenhouse Growers (CGGs), communicate and collaborate with each other asynchronously through negotiation and how potential conflicts between CCPSs with conflicting goals are resolved. The efficacy of the proposed mechanism is validated through simulation of different real-world acyclic SoCPSs topologies. The results show that proposed approach is able to balance the individual requirements of multiple connected CPSs while achieving SoCPSs’ mission."

      "abstract": "This paper deals with consensus in discrete-time multi-agent systems under directed networks subject to time-varying delays and input saturation. Because saturation might prevent multi-agent systems from attaining consensus, system analysis and controller design require the characterization of the allowed region for the initial conditions. The main contributions of this work are sufficient conditions for consensus analysis and design of distributed protocols for discrete-time systems. Moreover, the conditions lead to a procedure allowing an estimate of the region of attraction. Such a procedure considers the effect of current and delayed states separately, yielding broader estimates of the allowed region for initial conditions. The results follow from the transformation of the consensus problem into a stability problem, with the subsequent employment of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory. The conditions are formulated as convex optimization problems. Finally, the paper presents examples and comparisons with previous approaches to illustrate the validity of the proposed methods."

In this paper, we systematically investigate how collaborative reasoning performance is affected by three key design dimensions: (1) Expertise-Domain Alignment, (2) Collaboration Paradigm (structured workflow vs. diversity-driven integration), and (3) System Scale. Our findings reveal that expertise alignment benefits are highly domain-contingent, proving most effective for contextual reasoning tasks. Furthermore, collaboration focused on integrating diverse knowledge consistently outperforms rigid task decomposition. Finally, we empirically explore the impact of scaling the multi-agent system with expertise specialization and study the computational trade off, highlighting the need for more efficient communication protocol design. This work provides concrete guidelines for configuring specialized multi-agent system and identifies critical architectural trade-offs and bottlenecks for scalable multi-agent reasoning. The code will be made available upon acceptance."

      "abstract": "Introduction: In H.U.Donostia (Gipuzkoa) we identified multi-pathological patients with repeated admissions due to the same process. We wondered how to avoid it and design the first studies. Description of practice change implemented: Evolution of an integration strategy based on person-centered care incorporating liaison nurse, primary and hospital care and hospital at home service (HaH). Impact of new technologies. Aim: Improving patients’ quality of live. Training patients and healthcare providers. Optimizing the use of healthcare resources. Establishment of objectives and care directives. Target population: - Multi-pathological patients with high readmission rates due to HF and/or COPD. - Home-dependent patients. - Nursing home residents. Timeline: 2007-2008: before-after preliminary study with a multipronged strategy (EMAI) on HF with high readmission rates. 2008-2009: RCT: EMAI vs EMAI + telemedicine. 2009-2010: before-after study with a multipronged strategy (PAMI) targeting patients with high readmission rates. 2010-2011: cluster RCT: PAMI in nursing homes. 2014-2015: RCT: PAMI vs PAMI+web. 2017: RCT: PAMI vs PAMI+osarean. 2017: cluster RCT in home-dependent patients: PAMI vs PAMI+web/APP. Highlights: - Preliminary study with multi-intervention EMAI (assignment of a liaison nurse and a hospital-based specialist, structured telephone support, communication with the GP and appointment with the hospital-based specialist):  80% reduction in the number of bed days and in the attendances to the Emergency Department (ED) compared to the previous year. - PAMI: extension of the previous study with implementation of the multidisciplinary care programme with direct telephone line for maximum accessibility. 60.7% reduction in the number of bed days and 77% in the attendances to the ED compared to the previous year. High adherence to treatment and patient perceived good quality of care. - With reduction in-patient bed days, increased consultations. Adding telemedicine to PAMI reduced the use of health resources, without impact on the quality of life, but not being cost-effective. - Adapting PAMI to patients living in nursing homes: reduction in ED attendances and an exchange of inpatients bed days for days cared by HaH without differences in mortality. - Implementing PAMI with a web-based self-care programme during one year:  no differences in terms of mortality, visits to the ED, hospital admissions or quality of live. - The liaison nurse call was replaced by a call-center (Osarean) compared to classical PAMI: a decrease in visits to the ED (4%) and days of admission (3%) and an increase in stays in HaH and hospital visits. - Implementing PAMI with a self-care programme (web or APP) in home-dependent patients: pending results. Sustainability: Reorganizing healthcare system would allow optimizing actual resources Transferability: The technology and protocols are available to all in the Basque Country. Conclusions: Our multipronged strategy demonstrated its efficacy to manage better patients with high rates of readmissions or those with dependency (at home and nursing homes). Discussion: A unified clinical history accessible to all the agents involved and improving the communication channels would make the strategy more efficient. Lessons learned: Training both patients and professionals and accessibility to the health system are the main keys in the future to manage multi-pathological patients."

      "abstract": "Future wireless networks will need to support diverse applications (such as extended reality), scenarios (such as fully automated industries), and technological advances (such as terahertz communications). Current wireless networks are designed to perform adequately across multiple scenarios so they lack the adaptability needed for specific use cases. Therefore, meeting the stringent requirements of next-generation applications incorporating technology advances and operating in novel scenarios will necessitate wireless specialized networks which we refer to as SpecNets. These networks, equipped with cognitive capabilities, dynamically adapt to the unique demands of each application, e.g., by automatically selecting and configuring network mechanisms. An enabler of SpecNets are the recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), which allow to continuously learn and react to changing requirements and scenarios. By integrating AI/ML functionalities, SpecNets will fully leverage the concept of AI/ML-defined radios (MLDRs) that are able to autonomously establish their own communication protocols by acquiring contextual information and dynamically adapting to it. In this paper, we introduce SpecNets and explain how MLDR interfaces enable this concept. We present three illustrative use cases for wireless local area networks (WLANs): bespoke industrial networks, traffic-aware robust THz links, and coexisting networks. Finally, we showcase SpecNets' benefits in the industrial use case by introducing a lightweight, fast-converging ML agent based on multi-armed bandits (MABs). This agent dynamically optimizes channel access to meet varying performance needs: high throughput, low delay, or fair access. Results demonstrate significant gains over IEEE 802.11, highlighting the system's autonomous adaptability across diverse scenarios."

      "abstract": "Geothermal energy is a crucial component contributing to the development of local thermal energy systems as a carbon-neutral and reliable energy source. Insights into its availability derive from knowledge of geology, hydrogeology and the thermal regime of the subsurface. This expertise helps to locate and monitor geothermal installations as well as observe diverse aspects of natural and man-made thermal effects. Temperature measurements were performed in hydrogeological boreholes in south-western Poland using two methods, i.e., manual temperature logging and optical fibre distributed temperature sensing (OF DTS). It was assumed the water column in each borehole was under thermodynamic equilibrium with the local geothermal gradient of the subsurface, meaning rocks and aquifers. Most of the acquired results show typical patterns, with the upper part of the log depending on altitude, weather and climate as well as on seasonal temperature changes. For deeper parts, the temperature normally increases depending on the local geothermal gradient. The temperature logs for some boreholes located in urban agglomerations showed anthropogenic influence caused by the presence of infrastructure, the urban heat island effect, post-mining activities, etc. The presented research methods are suitable for applications connected with studies crucial to selecting the locations of geothermal installations and to optimize their technical parameters. The observations also help to identify zones of intensified groundwater flow, groundwater inrush into wells, fractured and fissured zones and many others."

      "abstract": "\n Recent advancements in data analytics and digitalization has increased the value which power generating assets, such as gas turbines, bring to power plant customers. Distributed power generation customers are increasingly partnering with gas turbine original equipment manufacturers and third-party digital service providers for cooperation in technology, innovation, and asset management using real-time data. In the past, it has been discussed that data analytics can be a key enabler in addressing challenges such as operational flexibility and efficient asset management.\n This paper presents some of the novel applications of data analytics developed by Siemens Energy for gas turbine operation, condition monitoring, and real-time decision making. Specifically, the paper presents the idea, application, and test case of remote diagnostic system, enhanced vibration analytics, and myFleetRisk™.\n Remote diagnostic system increases uptime, reduces operating cost by resource optimization, and improves plant output. This paper discusses both the reactive and proactive approach to gas turbine maintenance and how remote diagnostic system can be used with data analytics landscape for deviation monitoring.\n In addition to an overview of the underlying concept and its novelty, real-world applications are presented to show the benefits to distributed power generation customers. MyfleetRisk offers optimized and tailored maintenance solutions resulting in significant life cycle cost reduction. Enhanced vibration analytics module enables reliability centered maintenance and thereby addresses key challenges to customers."

A sector driven by security and a need to defer investment within the asset base is the Energy sector. After a brief introduction to maintenance process's in the oil and gas domain, this paper presents a novel approach to hierarchical predictive maintenance of assets in through a distributed architecture, represented as domain knowledge-based system, that provides a viable solution for systems containing similar multiple assets."

      "abstract": "Due to the need to decarbonize the power industry, distributed energy resources (DER) integration and penetration are increasing annually at unprecedented levels. This decarbonization will be enabled by the connection of inverter-based DER (IBD) technologies as well as the required distribution transformers(DT) to connect the inverters to the grid. Failure of these critical equipment, namely the inverters and DT, may lead to the partial or complete loss of the DER as a source or enabler of renewable generation. This paper tests and validates a real-time condition monitoring and diagnostic solution that can be used for utility-scale inverters and DTs. The solution is based on IoT edge processing technology and cloud-based data analytics, offering ease of integration, implementation, and scalability. The data analytics estimate in real-time the severity level of the asset condition using a mathematical model of the asset combined with the extended park vector approach (EPVA). This is a generic approach that could be applied to assets owned by utilities or assets owned by developers like PV generators and battery energy storage developers. In this paper, we tested this approach on two critical assets associated with the NaS battery energy storage system (BESS): DT and inverters. NaS BESS installed at the 13 MW PV plant in Dubai. This approach is a real-time monitoring and diagnostic solution for condition-based monitoring of critical assets. This is part of the utility strategy to study the effectiveness and move towards a data-driven and predictive maintenance approach."

      "abstract": "\n Inspection of ballast tanks and enclosures is generally performed using traditional methods such as visual inspection and non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques. However, it is common for these methods to often be labor intensive and limited by physical restrictions that prohibit access to certain areas. It is also challenging to plan for maintenance activities before the vessel has entered drydock due to limitations for inspections at sea or during short port calls. Further, the evaluation of the coating condition is heavily dependent on the inspector, and the quality of the data gathered is varying. It is the asset owner or the class society responsible for the inspection that owns the inspection reports, hence the assessment of the in-service performance of the ballast tank coating is not readily available for the supplier of the coating. Accordingly, there is a desire to transition to embedded technologies that provide monitoring capabilities that can capture the onset, and monitor the evolution of damage in an autonomous manner and preferably to detect coating degradations before extensive corrosion has developed.\n This paper presents the capabilities and limitations of a candidate sensor system to identify and characterize the location and severity of defects and degradation of water ballast tank coatings."

      "abstract": "The most pressing challenges in the development of fossil fuel energy resources are their high value and scarcity. Therefore, renewable energy achieved through the mismanagement of natural resources is one of the most important aspects defining the energy crisis. Solar, wind, geothermal and recurring event energy are examples of assets. The cost of wind turbines is much higher compared to diesel generators. Moreover, regular maintenance costs often account for up to one-twentieth of the total cost of a rotary engine. However, accidental failure of certain elements such as blades, gearboxes, supports, brake systems can lead to high costs. Identifying parts of a system with human resources or intelligent systems helps to stop and reduce serious failures. Therefore, a completely different condition monitoring system has been applied to wind turbines, providing a great opportunity to develop a large space for analysis in the fields of structural turbine condition monitoring and field condition monitoring systems. Assessing the health of critical system components can help you become more aware of failed components and reduce maintenance time and costs. By using a completely different kind of sensor for the rotary engine components and using the right control and data acquisition systems, a complex condition monitoring system is provided."

      "abstract": "The road transportation sector is a dominant and growing energy consumer. Although investigations to quantify the road infrastructure’s impact on energy consumption have been carried out, there are currently no standard methods to measure or label the energy efficiency of road networks. Consequently, road agencies and operators are limited to restricted types of data when managing the road network. Moreover, initiatives meant to reduce energy consumption cannot be measured and quantified. This work is, therefore, motivated by the desire to provide road agencies with a road energy efficiency monitoring concept that can provide frequent measurements over large areas across all weather conditions. The proposed system is based on measurements from in-vehicle sensors. The measurements are collected onboard with an Internet-of-Things (IoT) device, then transmitted periodically before being processed, normalized, and saved in a database. The normalization procedure involves modeling the vehicle’s primary driving resistances in the driving direction. It is hypothesized that the energy remaining after normalization holds information about wind conditions, vehicle-related inefficiencies, and the physical condition of the road. The new method was first validated utilizing a limited dataset of vehicles driving at a constant speed on a short highway section. Next, the method was applied to data obtained from ten nominally identical electric cars driven over highways and urban roads. The normalized energy was compared with road roughness measurements collected by a standard road profilometer. The average measured energy consumption was 1.55 Wh per 10 m. The average normalized energy consumption was 0.13 and 0.37 Wh per 10 m for highways and urban roads, respectively. A correlation analysis showed that normalized energy consumption was positively correlated to road roughness. The average Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.88 for aggregated data and 0.32 and 0.39 for 1000-m road sections on highways and urban roads, respectively. An increase in IRI of 1 m/km resulted in a 3.4% increase in normalized energy consumption. The results show that the normalized energy holds information about the road roughness. Thus, considering the emergence of connected vehicle technologies, the method seems promising and can potentially be used as a platform for future large-scale road energy efficiency monitoring."

      "abstract": "This paper presents an artificial intelligence (AI) based edge processing real-time maintenance system for the purposes of industrial manufacturing control and diagnostics. The system is evaluated in a soybean processing manufacturing facility to identify abnormalities and possible breakdown situations, prevent damage, reduce maintenance costs, and increase production productivity. The system can be used in any other manufacturing or chemical processing facility that make use of motors rotating equipment in different process phases. The system combines condition monitoring, fault detection, and diagnosis using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. These algorithms are used with data resulting from the continuous monitoring of relevant production equipment and motor parameters, such as temperature, vibration, sound/noise, and current/voltage. The condition monitoring integrates intelligent Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices with multiple sensors combined with AI-based techniques and edge processing. This is done to identify the parameter modifications and distinctive patterns that occur before a failure and predict forthcoming failure modes before they arise. The data from production equipment/motors is collected wirelessly using different communication protocols - such as Bluetooth low energy (BLE), Long range wide area network (LoRaWAN), and Wi-Fi - and aggregated into an edge computing processing unit via several gateways. The AI-based algorithms are embedded in the processing unit at the edge, allowing the prediction and intelligent control of the production equipment/motor parameters. IIoT devices for environmental sensing, vibration, temperature monitoring, and sound/ultrasound detection are used with embedded signal processing that runs on an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller. These devices are connected through either wired or wireless protocols. The system described addresses the components necessary for implementing the predictive maintenance (PdM) strategy in soybean industrial processing manufacturing environments. Additionally, it includes new elements that broaden the possibilities for prescriptive maintenance (PsM) developments to be made. The type of ML or DL techniques and algorithms used in maintenance modeling is dictated by the application and available data. The approach presented combines multiple data sources that improve the accuracy of condition monitoring and prediction. DL methods further increase the accuracy and require interpretable and efficient methods as well as the availability of significant amounts of (labeled) data."

      "abstract": "This article describes the event detection system of the NEXT-White detector, a 5 kg high pressure xenon TPC with electroluminescent amplification, located in the Laboratorio Subterráneo de Canfranc (LSC), Spain. The detector is based on a plane of photomultipliers (PMTs) for energy measurements and a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) tracking plane for offline topological event filtering. The event detection system, based on the SRS-ATCA data acquisition system developed in the framework of the CERN RD51 collaboration, has been designed to detect multiple events based on online PMT signal energy measurements and a coincidence-detection algorithm. Implemented on FPGA, the system has been successfully running and evolving during NEXT-White operation. The event detection system brings some relevant and new functionalities in the field. A distributed double event processor has been implemented to detect simultaneously two different types of events thus allowing simultaneous calibration and physics runs. This special feature provides constant monitoring of the detector conditions, being especially relevant to the lifetime and geometrical map computations which are needed to correct high-energy physics events. Other features, like primary scintillation event rejection, or a double buffer associated with the type of event being searched, help reduce the unnecessary data throughput thus minimizing dead time and improving trigger efficiency."

      "abstract": "This paper presents a pilot scheme for the integration of modern state-of-the-art turbomachinery design tools into project-based education of undergraduate students. This effort has been part of a larger international gas turbine project (IGTP) in which undergraduate students from a German (TU Berlin), a French (EC Lyon) and a Swiss (ETH Zurich) University undertook the design of the cooling system for the high pressure turbine of a 30,000lb thrust aeroengine. In addition, the goals of the project included self-organization and distribution of the tasks by the students themselves, the improvement of their communication skills and teamwork. At the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETHZ) the design-task was offered to a limited number of students, organized as a project team. Tasks were distributed related to the tools, in particular CAD, CFD and FEA. Appropriate short duration training in the software packages, was provided. The initial design tasks were performed through manual calculations by following traditional lecture notes. The conceptual design was followed by more sophisticated threedimensional design tasks using computer-aided techniques. Finally, the students were assessed continuously with respect to their technical contribution, working techniques and interaction with their peer group at national and international level. They were also probed regarding their opinion on various aspects of the project using interviews and forms. These surveys have been evaluated together with the opinion of the academic staff in order to form future directions. For the planning the students had to consider the engine as a whole before distributing the tasks individually. This enabled them to handle the design requirements successfully through effective use of the available software tools. An increased effort of the academic staff was registered in comparison to conventional teaching methods. However, a substantial technical and communicative growth of the students was evident in this early introduction into the application of engineering knowledge to a high technology application. P ge 715.1 “Proceedings of the 2002 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exposition Copyright  2002, American Society for Engineering Education” Introduction The competitive market and high technology of aircraft engines forces companies to use highly sophisticated computational methodologies to meet today’s development rate. The turbomachinery education program at the ETH Zurich has recently undergone a refinement aiming to create a modern teaching program that prepares students for an engineering career and includes a wide range of state-of-the-art topics in line with the interests of the relevant industry. The traditional lecture series have been reorganized to meet the demands of the ever-increasing use of computational methods within the design process. To prepare the integration of commercial design software packages into the lectures and the exercises of \"Turbomachinery Design\" course, a pilot phase was performed to investigate student interaction with complex software systems and optimize the design of the future. Based on the experience of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of Technical University of Berlin (TU Berlin), performing a similar project on national level, the IGTP raised the effort to international level. The tasks were distributed between student teams at the Turbomachinery Laboratory of ETHZ, the Turbomachinery Group of École Centrale de Lyon (EC Lyon) and TU Berlin. Each University team was responsible for one aspect of a complex design, with appropriate interfaces between the teams to ensure that the overall design meets the intended specifications. It also involved mentoring industrial partners from Rolls Royce Deutschland, MTU, SNECMA and Alstom Power. The project covered a two-semester period with regular telephone conferences and meetings with other team members. The main theme of the project at ETHZ was the design of the cooling system of the HPT for a 30,000lb-thrust turbofan two-spool aeroengine. The project team consisted of five students and a student project leader, an academic coordinator and supervisors, as well as industrial mentors from Alstom Power. A realistic scenario of the design process of an aircraft engine, however, cannot be transferred one-to-one into the student classroom environment. In this project, an attempt was made to follow the actual design process as much as possible, simplifying the process just sufficiently to keep it manageable within the academic framework. The introduction of complex software packages in the frame of this project was aimed at both probing the students’ receptivity as well as enabling them to perform a few iterations on the main tasks, based on the experience gained. Bringing teaching methodologies up-to-date followed the roadmap to a future education in turbomachinery. A marked observation of that work was that in German Universities design projects should be performed in interdisciplinary academic-industrial teams and communication and presentation skills could be improved. Objectives within the framework of engineering science at ETHZ After the first two years of background courses, the mechanical engineering students may choose two fields of specialization. In each of these areas, a research and design project is to be completed to promote independent work and creativity. The project topics may be centered on the Institutes research area and can be carried out in association with industry. Within the IGTP a limited number of students performed their design project, following the formal lectures, exercises P ge 715.2 “Proceedings of the 2002 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exposition Copyright  2002, American Society for Engineering Education” and laboratory sessions in parallel. The coordination of the IGTP and supervision of the individual design tasks of the students remains completely within the academic domain. The participating industrial partners function as mentors and consult the student team on specific items and provide a direct link to standard industrial practices. The strategic aims of ETHZ are the promotion and maintenance of quality in teaching at the highest international level. In order to support institutes in using advanced learning techniques, a funding project was initiated by ETHZ to promote the: • Use of new information technologies in teaching • Gain effective knowledge for advanced studies and interdisciplinary competence • Self responsible learning techniques and self organized arrangement of studies • Problem oriented working • Improvement of student social competence • Improvement of collaboration between universities abroad and ETHZ In addition to the aforementioned goals, the current project aimed to fulfil the following academic targets for the students: • Understand the design process of a complex device • Obtain an overview of the disciplines and their interactions • Achieve project work skills: self-organization, team work and time management • Exercise industrial working procedures and electronic communication techniques • Learn about cultural differences and improve communicative competence. Integrating computer-aided tools into the turbine design process The cooling system of the high pressure turbine of a 30,000 lb thrust two-spool bypass turbofan aeroengine was the main focus of the design exercise. Cruise conditions were assumed initially and some of the main design parameters are listed in Table 1. The students summarized the design process in a flowchart shown in fig. 1, having experienced the iterative character of the tasks and the necessity of return loops. Flight condition ISA Ma=0.8 Hub-tip ratio < 0.9 Thrust 30,000 lb Trailing edge thickness ≈ 0.05 mm Bypass ratio 5.5 Solidity 0.8 – 0.9 Nozzle guide vane metal angle 65° –75° Turning Past Throat 5° – 10° Table 1. Main Design Parameters An one-dimensional hand calculation of the cycle was the basic tool to understand the influence of the individual parameters. The best thermodynamic design point of the cycle was obtained through an optimization process. The commercial gas turbine performance program GasTurb was used to support the time consuming systematic parameter variation. The PC-based program includes several engine configurations and component performance maps. Output data are P ge 715.3 “Proceedings of the 2002 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exposition Copyright  2002, American Society for Engineering Education” available as enthalpy-entropy diagrams, velocity triangles, flight envelopes etc. The students were provided with a user-manual and a short introduction before proceeding independently. The initial blade geometry design was based on the hand calculations. Tangential velocity and radial work distribution were varied to match the requirements such as power output, degree of reaction and tip speed. These hand calculations were also essential in minimizing the risk that the students would proceed to complex computational tools without understanding the fundamental physical limitations and assumptions. For the optimization of the blade design the Educational Agile Engineering Design Software System was used. It consists of various modules including meanline analysis, 3D blade design tools as well as a CFD package and a FEA model generator. In academic environments, the difficulties associated with input-output issues are often Fig. 1. Flowchart of the design process underestimated, as more emphasis is placed to the scientific issues. In the current set up, students were guided to concentrate on the process as a whole rather than focussing on details of complex interfaces. Having experienced the difficulty of the task as well as the effort required for manual calculations, the students realized that a good design requires an excellent overview of all disciplines "

      "abstract": "Multi-axle-Driving-vehicle is a kind of the mobile robot and it also belongs to the construction machinery which generally has heavy load-capacity and huge size. As shown in Fig.1 and Fig.2, both hoisting-girder transporter and DCY900 transportation vehicle are multi-axle-driving vehicles. In order to decrease the ground-contacting pressure, the ground-clearance of the vehicle chassis and the size of the tyre, and to increase the loadingcapacity and the passing performance of the vehicle, the multi-axle driving and independently controlled steer axles are employed, and also distributed electro-hydraulic proportional control is applied to the heavy type of vehicles. Such a large-scale vehicle has to deal with the complex motion control problem. The controlled output motions of multiple axles should meet certain matching condition or corresponding relationship so as to make the whole vehicle to realize the expected contouring motion trace. For example, all the powered steer axles have to be coordinately controlled in real time in order to achieve smooth and accurate steering motion without slipping and sliding. Besides the steering function, the steer axles are also designed to automatically level the vehicle body when it moves in an uneven terrain. It follows that the motion synthesis and coordinated control methods should concurrently cope with the tasks and motions of multiple subsystems. Conventionally, coordinated control of a simple mechatronics system is realized through a centralized control scheme in which each of the actuators is directly linked to the controller through cable in a point-to-point manner. However, for a complex multi-tasking mechatronic system with a large number of subsystems and actuators, such a control scheme is impractical. This is especially true for a large-scale multi-axle vehicle because it is huge in size and has many distributed subsystems to be arranged anywhere in the vehicle. If a centralized control scheme is employed, it will result in a very messy wiring scheme. Thanks for the advanced network technologies, which provide us an effective way to realize coordinated control for the multi-axle driving vehicles. In a network environment, all the control devices such as sensors, actuators, and controllers are distributed and simply linked together through network interfaces (e.g., Field-bus, Industrial Ethernet, and mobile net) so as to achieve coordination and resources sharing efficiently. In convention, a network-based mechatronic control system is called an NCS (Networked Control System), which has many advantages over a centralized control system, e.g., low installation cost, ease of system maintenance, simplicity in failure diagnosis, and high flexibility in system management"

For the Program Committee Mirna Džamonja Abstracts of Invited Talkss of Invited Talks DAVID ASPERÓ, Generic absoluteness for Chang models. School of Mathematics, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich NR4 7TJ, UK. E-mail: d.aspero@uea.ac.uk. URL Address: https://archive.uea.ac.uk/∼bfe12ncu/ The main focus of the talk will be on extensions of Woodin’s classical result that, in the presence of a proper class of Woodin cardinals, CV and CV P are elementally equivalent for every set—forcing P (where Cκ denotes the κ-Chang model). 1. In the first part of the talk I will present joint work with Asaf Karagila in which we derive generic absoluteness for C over the base theory ZF +DC. 2. Matteo Viale has defined a strengthening MM of Martin’s Maximum which, in the presence of a proper class of sufficiently strong large cardinals, completely decides the theory of C 1 modulo forcing in the class Γ of set—forcing notions preserving stationary subsets of 1; this means that if MM holds, P ∈ Γ, and P forces MM, then CV 1 and CVP 1 are elementarily equivalent. MM is the first example of a “category forcing axiom.” In the second part of the talk I will present some recent joint work with Viale in which we extend his machinery to deal with other classes Γ of forcing notions, thereby proving LOGIC COLLOQUIUM ’17 213 the existence of several mutually incompatible category forcing axioms, each one of which is complete for the theory of C 1 , in the appropriate sense, modulo forcing in Γ. ALESSANDRO BERARDUCCI, Surreal differential calculus. Department of Mathematics, University of Pisa, Largo Bruno Pontecorvo 5, 56127 Pisa, Italy. E-mail: alessandro.berarducci@unipi.it. I will report on joint surreal work with Vincenzo Mantova. We recall that Conway’s ordered field of surreal numbers contains both the real numbers and the ordinal numbers. The surreal sum and product of two ordinals coincide with the Hessenberg sum and product, and Cantor’s normal form of ordinals has a natural extension to the surreals. In [1] we proved that there is a meaningful way to take both the derivative and the integral (antiderivative) of a surreal number, hence in particular on an ordinal number. The derivative of the ordinal number omega is 1, the derivative of a real number is zero, and the derivative of the sum and product of two surreal numbers obeys the expected rules. More difficult is to understand what is the derivative of an ordinal power of omega, for instance the first epsilon-number, but this can be done in a way that reflects the formal properties of the derivation on a Hardy field (germs of nonoscillating real functions). In [2] we showed that many surreal numbers can indeed be interpreted as germs of differentiable functions on the surreals themselves, so that the derivative acquires the usual analytic meaning as a limit. It is still open whether we can interpret all the surreals as differentiable functions, possibly changing the definition of the derivative. [1] A.

Laboratoire de Mathématiques d’Orsay, Univ. Paris-Sud, CNRS, Univ. Paris-Saclay, 91405 Orsay, France. E-mail: elisabeth.bouscaren@math.u-psud.fr. In this talk, we will try to explain the use of some important model-theoretic notions, focusing on the model-theory of finite rank groups and on the notion of orthogonality. Their use in applications to algebraic geometry will be gently illustrated by some examples. This talk is partly inspired by a series of recent joint articles with Franck Benoist (Paris-Sud) and Anand Pillay (Notre-Dame), giving new model theoretic proofs of the original results of Ehud Hrushovski on the Mordell–Lang Conjecture for function fields (1994). DENIS HIRSCHFELDT, Computability theory and asymptotic density. Department of Mathematics, The University of Chicago, 5734 S. University Ave., Chicago, IL 60637, USA. E-mail: drh@math.uchicago.edu. URL Address: www.math.uchicago.edu/∼drh. The notion of generic-case complexity was introduced by Kapovich, Myasnikov, Schupp, and Shpilrain to study problems with high worst-case complexity that are nevertheless easy to solve in most instances. They also introduced the notion of generic computability, which captures the idea of having a partial algorithm that halts for almost all inputs, and correctly computes a decision problem whenever it halts. Jockusch and Schupp began the general computability-theoretic investigation of generic computability and also defined the notion of coarse computability, which captures the idea of having a total algorithm that might make mistakes but correctly decides the given problem for almost all inputs (although this notion had been studied earlier in Terwijn’s dissertation). Two related notions, which allow for both failures to answer and mistakes, have been studied by Astor, Hirschfeldt, and Jockusch (although one of them had been considered in the 1970’s by Meyer and by Lynch). All of 214 LOGIC COLLOQUIUM ’17 these notions lead to notions of reducibility and associated degree structures. I will discuss recent and ongoing work in the study of these reducibilities. PER MARTIN-LÖF, Assertion and request. Department of Mathematics, Stockholm University, 106 91 Stockholm, Sweden. E-mail: pml@math.su.se. Think of the content of an assertion as something that is to be done: let us call it a task. Peirce’s explanation of the speech act of assertion as the assuming of responsibility then takes the form: by making an assertion, you assume the responsibility, or duty, of performing the task which constitutes the content of the assertion, when requested to do so by the hearer. Thus a duty on the part of the speaker appears as a right on the part of the hearer to request the speaker to perform his duty: this is an instance of what is called the correlativity of rights and duties, a fundamental principle of deontological ethics which can be traced back to Bentham. In logic, it appears as the correlativity of assertions and requests. Since nothing but assertions appear in the usual inference rules of logic, there arises the question of what the rules are that govern the correlative requests. In the case of constructive type theory, they turn out to be the rules which bring the meaning explanations for the various forms of assertion to formal expression. Thus, in analogy with Gentzen’s dictum that the propositional operations, the connectives and the quantifiers, are defined by their introduction rules, we may say that the forms of assertion are defined by their associated request rules. DAG PRAWITZ, Gentzen’s justification of inferences and the ecumenical systems. Department of Philosopy, Stockholm University, 106 91 Stockholm, Sweden. E-mail: dag.prawitz@philosophy.su.se. Some of the different proposals for how to make precise Gentzen’s way of justifying the introduction and elimination rules of natural deduction are briefly surveyed. A crucial question is whether the justification is applicable only to inferences occurring in intuitionistic logic or can be extended also to inferences occurring in classical logic. I shall argue that it is extendible to classical inference rules but that for some logical constants the introduction rules must vary depending on whether the constant is read classically or intuitionistically—when the constant is read classically the rule must be weaker than when it is read intuitionistically. Respecting this condition, it is possible to allow classical and intuitionistic logical constants in one and the same system, a system that we may call the ecumenical system. In this system the usual elimination rules for some logical constants do not hold when the constant is read classically. Modus ponens is an example—it is not valid generally when implication is read classically but remains valid when also all of the constants of the subformulas of the implication are read classically. SONJA SMETS, The logical basis of a formal epistemology for social networks. ILLC, University of Amsterdam, Science Park 107, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. E-mail: S.J.L.Smets@uva.nl. In this presentation I focus on a logical–philosophical study of group beliefs and collective “knowledge”, and their dynamics in communities of interconnected agents capable of reflection, communication, reasoning, argumentation, etc. In particular, the aim is to study belief formation and belief diffusion (doxastic influence) in social networks, and to characterize a group’s “epistemic potential”. This covers cases in which a group’s ability to track the truth is higher than that of each of its members (the “wisdom of the crowds”: distributed knowledge, epistemic democracy, and other beneficial forms of belief aggregation and deliberation), as well as situations in which the group’s dynamics leads to informational distortions (the “madness of the crowds”: informational cascades, “groupthink”, the curse of the committee, pluralistic ignorance, group polarization, etc). I look at several logical formalisms that make explicit various factors affecting the epistemic potential of a group: the agents’ degree of interconnectedness, their degree of mutual trust, their different epistemic interests (their “questions”), their different attitudes towards the available evidence and its sources, etc. In this presentation I refer to a number of recent articles (1,2,3,4,5,6), that LOGIC COLLOQUIUM ’17 215 make use a variety of formal tools ranging from dynamic epistemic logics and probabilistic logics. I conclude with some philosophical reflections about the nature and meaning"

      "abstract": "Abstract Railway maintenance especially on infrastructure produces a vast amount of data. However, having data is not synonymous with having information; rather, data must be processed to extract information. In railway maintenance, the development of key performance indicators (KPIs) linked to punctuality or capacity can help planned and scheduled maintenance, thus aligning the maintenance department with corporate objectives. There is a need for an improved method to analyse railway data to find the relevant KPIs. The system should support maintainers, answering such questions as what maintenance should be done, where and when. The system should equip the user with the knowledge of the infrastructure’s condition and configuration, and the traffic situation so maintenance resources can be targeted to only those areas needing work. The amount of information is vast, so it must be hierarchized and aggregated; users must filter out the useless indicators. Data are fused by compiling several individual indicators into a single index; the resulting composite indicators measure multidimensional concepts which cannot be captured by a single index. The paper describes a method of monitoring a complex entity. In this scenario, a plurality of use indices and weighting values are used to create a composite and aggregated use index from a combination of lower level use indices and weighting values. The resulting composite and aggregated indicators can be a decision-making tool for asset managers at different hierarchical levels."

This project aimed at enabling real-time monitoring of electrical parameters such as voltage, current and reactive-power-flow. While enabling these features, it was vital to make the solution compact and retrofit-to-existinginfrastructure for saving cost in terms of reduced equipment’s footprint. In this pilot project, electrical parameters and direction of power flow were accurately captured using sensor-based technology. Captured parameters and corresponding benefits are analyzed in detail in this paper. Further, the availability of real-time captured data can be potentially used through analytical tools for enabling many features such as predictive maintenance and identifying faulted-segments in underground cabling networks. Power-flow-direction can potentially be used for advanced protection coordination in the looped distribution network. Thus, enabling reliable integration of existing grid with distributed energy generation source."

This approach enables end-user to play the role of prosumers in the market and subsequently contributes to diminish the carbon footprint and the burden on utility grids. The coordination of trading surpluses of energy that is generated by house renewable energy resources (RERs) and the supply of shortages by external networks (main grid) is a necessity. This paper proposes a hierarchical architecture to manage energy in multiple smart buildings leveraging federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL) with dynamic load in a distributed manner. Within the context of the developed FDRL-based framework, each agent that is hosted in local building energy management systems (BEMS) trains a local deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model and shares its experience in the form of model hyperparameters to the federation layer in the energy management system (EMS). Simulation studies are conducted using one EMS and up to twenty smart houses that are equipped with photovoltaic (PV) systems and batteries. This iterative training approach enables the proposed discretized soft actor-critic (SAC) agents to aggregate the collected knowledge to expedite the overall learning procedure and reduce costs and CO2 emissions, while the federation approach can mitigate privacy breaches. The numerical results confirm the performance of the proposed framework under different daytime periods, loads, and temperatures."

      "abstract": "Smart power grids (SGs) enhance efficiency, reliability, and sustainability by integrating distributed energy resources (DERs) such as solar panels and wind turbines. A key challenge in SGs is managing home battery charging during periods of insufficient renewable energy generation to ensure fairness, efficiency, and customer satisfaction. This paper introduces a secure reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for optimizing battery charging coordination while addressing privacy concerns and false data injection (FDI) attacks. Privacy is preserved through Federated Learning (FL), enabling collaborative model training without sharing sensitive State of Charge (SoC) data that could reveal personal routines. To combat FDI attacks, Deep Learning (DL)-based detectors are deployed to identify malicious SoC data manipulation. To improve FL efficiency, the Change and Transmit (CAT) technique reduces communication overhead by transmitting only model parameters that experience enough change comparing to the last round. Extensive experiments validate the framework’s efficacy. The RL-based charging coordinator ensures fairness by maintaining SoC levels within thresholds and reduces overall power utilization through optimal grid power allocation. The CAT-FL approach achieves up to 93.5% communication overhead reduction, while DL-based detectors maintain high accuracy, with supervised models reaching 99.84% and anomaly detection models achieving 92.1%. Moreover, the RL agent trained via FL demonstrates strong generalization, achieving high cumulative rewards and equitable power allocation when applied to new data owners which did not participate in FL training. This framework provides a scalable, privacy-preserving, and efficient solution for energy management in SGs, offering high accuracy against FDI attacks and paving the way for the future of smart grid deployments."

      "abstract": "The increased integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) results in a two-way dynamic operation of the power distribution grid. Consequently, conventional Protection, Automation, and Control (PAC) systems are not able to manage DER related constraints in the distribution grid. New Fault location, Isolation, and service Recovery (FLISR) schemes based on communication capabilities are gaining a lot of momentum. Together with the 5th generation of mobile networks (5G), they improve the reactivity and the coordination of the grid defense lines. In this context, we present in this paper a FLISR traffic management framework in 5G Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) networks. Our framework consists first in optimizing the placement of FLISR protection functions within the Radio Access Network (RAN). Then, a joint routing and link scheduling of FLISR traffic in the 5G-RAN is proposed by taking into account the energy consumption. To achieve this, we formulate the master problem as two correlated integer linear programs (ILP) and present an optimal solution to solve it. Our objective is to find the best trade-off between the achieved network throughput and energy consumption, while ensuring the latency constraint of FLISR traffic. Our approach is compliant with the Software-Defined Radio Access Network (SD-RAN) paradigm since it can be integrated as a control flow application on top of a SD-RAN controller. Through a case study, we show that our proposed approach achieves significant gains in terms of energy consumption, flow acceptance and achieved network throughput, compared to baseline routing and placement strategies."

      "abstract": "The integration of computational capabilities with the electrical infrastructure of the grid can be envisioned as a societal scale Cyber Physical System (CPS). Middleware frameworks can act as a layer of abstraction that manages the interaction between disparate applications to facilitate intelligent control and management of energy production and consumption. This demonstration showcases Resilient Information Architecture Platform for Smart Grid (RIAPS), a distributed software platform that combines a domain specific modeling language with framework-level services such as communication, remote deployment of applications, distributed coordination, time synchronization, and fault tolerance, to develop and run distributed applications. An example of an energy demand curtailment scheme called load shedding is presented, to highlight how the RIAPS framework can be used to implement distributed algorithms to control elements of a power system, which runs as a simulation using OpenDSS."

Over-voltages in LV networks limit the further absorption of DG, especially in rural and suburban areas. Several voltage control (VC) applications can be implemented to solve these issues. These VC applications can be further combined or even coordinated with the help of information and communication technology (ICT) to improve the control effect. This paper focusses on the combination and coordination of these VC applications. The control effects are evaluated are evaluated for a wide range of artificial synthetic LV networks.

      "abstract": "Actions under this plan will result in a common specification for price. This specification will be used in demand response applications, market transactions, distributed energy resource integration, meter communications, and many other inter-domain communications. Businesses, homes, electric vehicles, and the power grid will benefit from automated and timely communication of energy prices, characteristics, quantities, and related information. Price is a number associated with product characteristics, including delivery schedule, quality (reliability, power quality, source, etc.), and environmental and regulatory characteristics. Price also is a common abstraction for abundance, scarcity, and other market conditions. A common price model will define how to exchange data on energy characteristics, availability, and schedules to support efficient communication of information in any market. Why Coordination of energy supply and demand requires a common understanding of supply and demand. A simple quotation of price, quantity, and characteristics in a consistent way across markets enables new markets and integration of distributed energy resources. Price and product definition are key to transparent market accounting. A consistent information model will reduce implementation costs. A consistent model for market information exchange simplifies communication flow and improves the quality and efficiency of actions taken by energy providers, distributors, and consumers. Better communication of actionable energy prices facilitates effective dynamic pricing and is necessary for net-zero-energy buildings, supply-demand integration, and other efficiency and sustainability initiatives. Common, up-to-the-moment pricing information is also an enabler of local generation and storage of energy, such as electric-charging and thermal-storage technologies for homes and buildings. Major Objectives • Develop a summary of power reliability and quality characteristics that affect price and availability (supply side) and desirability (demand side). • Survey existing price communications and develop harmonized specification (review by October 2009, draft specification by April 2010). • Engage the broad group of stakeholders into the effort. • Build on existing work in financial energy markets and existing demand response programs. • Integrate with schedule and interval specifications under development (see section 5.3).

This paper presents a distributed autonomous control architecture for electric vehicle (EV) chargers and a clustering method for charging coordination. The architecture framework is detailed depending on the number of chargers and specific location properties. Moreover, the framework unveils the communication, measurement and power flow. The aforementioned approach aims at simplifying the overall charging experience for the EV owners while coupling it with a healthy grid behavior. The proposed control architecture is simulated on a prosumer case with two EVs. The performance of the controller is considerably affected by observability capabilities of current smart-meters. Faster measurement cycles of smart-meters can reduce the overshoot time span but not prevent it."

To fully understand the interdependency between them, we propose to integrate the Network Simulator 3 (NS3) into the High Engine for Large-Scale Infrastructure Co-Simulation (HELICS), a new open-source, cyber-physical-energy co-simulation platform. This paper aims to the development and case study of the HELICS-based high performance distribution-communication co-simulation framework for the DER coordination. The novel co-simulation framework for the NS3 integrating into the HELICS is developed. The DER monitoring application about hybrid smart grid communication network design is simulated and validated on this proposed HELICS-based cyber-physical co-simulation platform."

      "abstract": "This work involves the development of a device - EmSense (“Emulated Sensor”) - that emulates a high-resolution sensor for a power grid. The device collects raw current and voltage sensor data which derive from ORNL's signature library. This library is a dataset that ORNL curates from many different sources that include power systems from various utilities. The EmSense packages the data from the library in the form of IEC 61850 Sampled Value (SV) packets and then broadcasts these SV packets on the network. In another mode, EmSense can generate artificial sinusoidal data that appears as waveforms for voltage and current signals. EmSense has an internal algorithm for determining the period of a signal based on the data so that the period can be specified as a variable in the IEC 61850 packets. The purpose of EmSense is to allow for experimentation with the Dark Net Infrastructure where a variety of power line sensors must be represented along with their typical communication traffic. The EmSense device was developed in coordination with the software for receiving and processing the packets in the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) framework of the DarkNet Project. This receiving software must have a methodology for dealing with information of high velocity, variety, and volume. Experimenting with EmSense facilitates the development of such software. The results showed that the DLT framework and the trust-anchoring approach managed to process a large flow of traffic even with up to six instances of EmSense device broadcasting data. This was achieved without overfilling packet queues in the memory of the actual hardware of the DLT devices or causing the Central Processing Unit (CPU) of the hardware to be overwhelmed. The DLTs were also able to store the data in a compact and useful form for later analysis and archival purposes."

      "abstract": "Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) play a pivotal role in transportation electrification. The flexible nature of PEVs’ charging demand can be utilized for reducing charging cost as well as optimizing the operating cost of power and transportation networks. Utilizing charging flexibility of geographically spread PEVs requires design and implementation of efficient optimization algorithms. There is a synergy between electro mobility (e-Mobility) infrastructures (including charging stations) and PEVs. In this paper, we introduce a holistic framework to model interdependent nature of power systems and electrified transportation networks, enhance the operational performance of these systems as a network-of-networks, and explain the required information exchange via coupling agents (e.g., PEVs and charging stations). We develop a holistic framework that enables distributed coordination of interdependent networks through the IoT lens. To this end, we propose to use a fully distributed consensus+innovations approach. This iterative algorithm achieves a distributed solution of the decision making for each agent through local computations and limited communication with other neighboring agents that are influential in that specific decision. For instance, the optimal routing decision of a PEV involves a different set of agents as compared with the optimal charging strategy of the same PEV. The exogenous information from an external network/agent can affect internal operation of the other agents. For instance, having some information about traffic congestion at the transportation networks changes the decision of PEVs to charge their battery at another location. Our approach constitutes solving an iterative problem, which utilizes communication at the smart city layer, as a network of infrastructures, including power grid and electrified transportation network, that enables fully distributed coordination of agents. Fully distributed decision making enables scalability of the solution and plug-and-play capability, as well as increasing the information privacy of PEVs by only requiring limited local information exchange with neighboring agents. We investigate a detailed application of our framework for interdependent power systems and electrified transportation networks. To this end, we first identify the functionalities, constraints, objectives, and decision variables of each network. Then, we investigate the interdependent interactions among these networks and their corresponding agents."

      "abstract": "The exponential growth of distributed energy resources is enabling the transformation of traditional consumers in the smart grid into prosumers. This transition presents a promising opportunity for sustainable energy trading. However, the integration of prosumers in the energy market imposes new considerations in designing unified and sustainable frameworks for efficient use of the power and communication infrastructure. Furthermore, several issues need to be tackled to adequately promote the adoption of decentralized renewable-energy-oriented systems, such as communication overhead, data privacy, scalability, and sustainability. In this article, we present the different aspects and challenges to be addressed for building efficient energy trading markets in relation to communication and smart decision making. Accordingly, we propose a multi-level pro-decision framework for prosumer communities to achieve collective goals. Since the individual decisions of prosumers are mainly driven by individual self-sufficiency goals, the framework prioritizes the individual prosumers' decisions and relies on the 5G wireless network for fast coordination among community members. In fact, each prosumer predicts energy production and consumption to make proactive trading decisions as a response to collective-level requests. Moreover, the collaboration of the community is further extended by including the collaborative training of prediction models using federated learning, assisted by edge servers and prosumer home area equipment. In addition to preserving prosumers' privacy, we show through evaluations that training prediction models using federated learning yields high accuracy for different energy resources while reducing the communication overhead."

      "abstract": "This report outlines National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)’s validation tools developed to help address the smart grid’s emergent needs and complement research and standards coordination efforts. Rapid advances have enabled an opportunity for the grid to autonomously and simultaneously control generation, balance load, and regulate power quality. The grid will need this coordinated control to regulate power and voltage in realtime, to meet fast-changing power demands, especially with increasing distributed energy resources. To do this, the grid needs measurements from across the distribution network to accurately assess demand and prevent negative impact of variable grid-edge generation. Additionally, such a coordinated control system depends on a new operating paradigm with two-way information flows between domains of the grid. The different operational domains and the information flows between them are outlined in the NIST Framework and Roadmap of Smart Grid Interoperability Standards, Release 4.0 [1]. The coordinated control mentioned above requires improved observability of the state of distributed resources and depends on marshalling increasingly decentralized control systems. To implement such a system and meet system level performance objectives, distribution system operators (DSOs) need an understanding of the bandwidth, security and integrity considerations while also ensuring reliability at the grid’s edges. Industry is also concerned with how to represent uncertainties like latency and cyber-vulnerabilities in a complex cyber-physical system. Additionally, industry is concerned that standards are focused more on devices than on coordinated control systems. Thus, this report presents an overview of a data acquistion and control system designed by NIST as a validation tool and deployed on the NIST campus in Gaithersburg, MD. This system is comprised of interoperating computing resources, cybersecurity infrastructure, communication links and data interfaces to both take measurements and to transmit control inputs to commonly used distribution system control components. An important proof of concept included in the aforementioned validation system is a data pipeline optimized to stream data from a 5 MW PV inverter and multiple sources of synchronized phasor data. This pipeline utilizes industry standard information modeling and communication standards with the intent of being compatible with industry standard testing equipment. This capability demonstrates how DSOs could test current standards against functionality — such as phasor based control of distribution circuits. Assumptions and Assessment of Needs The research presented in this report is motivated by these assumptions: 1. The grid is evolving towards coordinated control of distributed energy resources. 2. Formal methods to quantify uncertainty in power systems will be standardized across the DSO community. i _____________________________________________________________________________________ This puication is avilable ree of carge rom : https://rg/10.6028/N IST.TN .173 3. Industry standards and testing protocols will evolve to capture system-level performance. An assessment of the current situation indicates that it is computationally infeasible to fully model and centralize the control of distribution system operations, especially given the uncertainties associated with distributed generation. However, it may be possible to improve computational feasibility using approximation tools such as reachability analysis for planning and modeling. Recent state-of-the-art methods may enable coordinated control of distributed energy resources. These include optimization-based methods and consensus–based controls. Regarding standards and testing, NIST assesses that standards-setting organizations (SSOs) are in the early stages of working with industry to develop precise and accepted system-level interoperability test methodologies [2] and that these efforts will be positively impacted with the availability of validation and analysis tools tailored to distribution circuits. Areas of research and development for validation The NIST Smart Grid Program has initiated several research projects to address the gap in validation and test tools. These projects include efforts to harmonize information models to help DSOs integrate groups of distributed energy resources on their primary and secondary feeders into an existing Distribution Management System (DMS). Researchers at NIST are developing an Adaptive Reference Governor scheme to assist in distributed control of constrained distributed energy resources (DERs). This Reference Governor is a control strategy that predicts the evolution of the system state to enforce pre-specified constraints on the inputs, states or the outputs of a system. Additionally, NIST is using its expertise in electrical metrology and test design to develop software libraries, calibration methods and automated test software to meet validation needs for controlling distributed energy resources. Campus capabilities for validation This research is performed using the facilities of NIST campus in Gaithersburg, Maryland. These include a distribution network with four 13.8 kV feeders that span the campus. In addition to a local power utility, this network is supplied by two large on-site, distributed generators in addition to four smaller generators. Nodal state variables such as voltage and current magnitude, real and reactive power are reported to a central database, along with some power quality measurements such as total harmonic distortion, frequency, and power factor. Measurements are acquired at terminal nodes. A 400 Mbps data pipeline for inverter and phasor data was implemented to meet the needs of emerging research needs. The pipeline captures time-aligned data from multiple sites enabling researchers to monitor and respond to fast occurring events. NIST researchers have used the capabilities of the streaming pipeline to validate an AdaptiveContractive Reference Governor for constraint aware fast responding power converters. ii _____________________________________________________________________________________ This puication is avilable ree of carge rom : https://rg/10.6028/N IST.TN .173"

      "abstract": "Microgrids play a major role in enabling the widespread adoption of renewable distributed energy resources. However, as the power generated from renewable resources is intermittent in nature, it impacts the dynamics and stability of the microgrid, and hence their integration needs new approaches to coordination and control. The existing systems lack run-time adaptive behavior. To face these constraints, the electric energy system must adapt by integrating Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Multiagent system (MAS) is emerging as an integrated solution approach to distributed computing, communication, and data integration needs for smart grid application. Distributed and heterogeneous information can be efficiently processed locally, but utilized globally to coordinate distributed knowledge networks, resulting in reduction of information processing time and network bandwidth. Parallel operations, asynchronous communication, and autonomous actions of agents enable MAS to adapt to dynamic changes of the environment, thereby improving the reliability, responsiveness, fault tolerance, and stability of the microgrid. In this chapter, MAS is implemented with Java Agent DEvelopment (JADE) framework for advanced energy management of a microgrid. Also, MAS is linked with Arduino microcontroller for practical verification of agent operations. Three microgrids are interconnected to form a microgrid testbed, and smart grid features such as demand side management and plug and play are implemented, making it into a smart microgrid."

This article presents energy-efficient Jacobi distributed algorithm for solving the algebraic equation towards to data regression modeling. In particular, the distributed iterative scheme is proposed to seek the solution of regression algebraic equation with the mixture representation of the regression model. In doing this, an elegant tree-based routing structure is employed to organize the nodes in coordination to accomplish the in-network implementation of the distributed iterative scheme. Under this routing scheme, the intersections among nodes are decoupled via asynchronous message passing protocol, which ensure each node can receive the exact decoupled information from local neighboring nodes for updating its local models. Rather than transmitting the raw sensed data to base station through the network, our Jacobi distributed algorithm provide an energy-saving data acquisition by only collecting the optimal weighted coefficients. The experimental results show that the method proposed here outperforms over the existing schemes in both computation costs and transmission requirements."
