BACKGROUNDSMART grid is a term referring to the next generationpower grid in which the electricity distribution and man-agement is upgraded by incorporating advanced two-waycommunications and pervasive computing capabilities for im-proved control, efficiency, reliability and safety. A smart griddelivers electricity between suppliers and consumers usingtwo-way digital technologies. It controls intelligent appliancesat consumers\u2019 home or building to save energy, reduce costand increase reliability, efficiency and transparency [1]. Asmart grid is expected to be a modernization of the legacyelectricity network. It provides monitoring, protecting andoptimizing automatically to operation of the interconnectedelements.

A smart grid is characterized by the bi-directional connection of electricity and information flowsto create an automated, widely distributed delivery network.It incorporates the legacy electricity grid the benefits ofmodern communications to deliver real-time information andenable the near-instantaneous balance of supply and demandmanagement [3].Many technologies to be adopted by smart grid havealready been used in other industrial applications, such assensor networks in manufacturing and wireless networks intelecommunications, and are being adapted for use in newintelligent and interconnected paradigm. In general, smart gridcommunication technologies can be grouped into five keyareas: advanced components, sensing and measurement, im-proved interfaces and decision support, standards and groups,and integrated communications.Figure 1 illustrates a general architecture for smart gridcommunication infrastructures, which includes home areanetworks (HANs), business area networks (BANs), neigh-borhood area networks (NANs), data centers, and substationautomation integration systems [4]. Smart grids distribute elec-tricity between generators (both traditional power generationand distributed generation sources) and end users (industrial,commercial, residential consumers) using bi-directional infor-mation flow to control intelligent appliances at consumers\u2019side saving energy consumption and reducing the consequentexpense, meanwhile increasing system reliability and opera-tion transparency. With a communication infrastructure, thesmart metering/monitoring techniques can provide the real-time energy consumption as a feedback and correspond tothe demand to/from utilities. Network operation center canretrieve those customer power usage data and the on-linemarket pricing from data centers to optimize the electricitygeneration, distribution according to the energy consumption.In a complex smart grid system, through wide deploymentof new smart grid components and the convergence of existinginformation and control technologies applied in the legacypower grid, it can offer sustainable operations to both utilitiesand customers [5]. It can also enhance the efficiency of legacypower generation, transmission and distribution systems andpenetrate the usage of clean renewable energy by introducingmodern communication systems into smart grids.1553-877X/12/$25.00 c\u00a9 2012 IEEEThis article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

Smart Grid Communication Infrastructures [4]The cornerstone of a smart grid is the ability for multipleentities (e.g. intelligent devices, dedicated software, processes,control center, etc) to interact via a communication infrastruc-ture. It follows that the development of a reliable and per-vasive communication infrastructure represents crucial issuesin both structure and operation of smart grid communicationsystems [6], [7]. In this connection, a strategic requirementin supporting this process is the development of a reliablecommunication infrastructure for establishing robust real-timedata transportation through Wide Area Networks (WANs) tothe distribution feeder and customer level [8].Existing electrical utility WANs are based on a hybridof communication technologies including wired technologiessuch as fiber optics, power line communication (PLC) sys-tems, copper-wire line, and a variety of wireless technolo-gies (i.e. data communications in cellular networks suchas GSM/GPRS/WiMax/WLAN and Cognitive Radio [9]).They are designed to support some monitoring/controllingapplications as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition(SCADA)/Energy Management Systems (EMS), DistributionManagement Systems (DMS), Enterprise Resource Plan-ning (ERP) systems, generation plant automation, distributionfeeder automation and physical security for facilities in widerange areas with very limited bandwidth and capacity in closednetworks.Many applications such as energy metering on the smartgrid, have emerged from a decade of research in wirelesssensor networks. However, the lack of an IP-based networkarchitecture precluded sensor networks from interoperatingwith the Internet, limiting their real-world impact. The IETFchartered the 6LoWPAN and RoLL working groups to specifystandards at various layers of the protocol stack with thegoal of connecting low-power devices to the Internet. In [10]the authors present the standards proposed by these workinggroups, and describe how the research community activelyparticipates in this process by influencing their design andproviding open source implementations.The new communication infrastructures should evolve to-ward nearly ubiquitous data transport networks able to han-dle power delivery applications along with vast amount ofnew data coming from the smart grid applications. Thesenetworks should be scalable, in order to support the presentand the future set of functions characterizing the emergingsmart grid communication technological platform, and highlypervasive in order to support the deployment of last-milecommunications (i.e. from a backbone to the terminal cus-tomers locations) [11]. In the rest of this section, we discussseveral key factors for smart grid systems including power linecommunications, distributed energy resources, smart metering,and monitoring and controlling.A. Power Line CommunicationsPower line communications (PLCs) uses the power feederline as communication media. First generation ripple controlsystems provide one-way communications, in which central-ized load control and peak shaving have been performedfor many years. The European standards body CENELECrestricted the use of frequencies between 3 kHz and 95 kHzfor two-way communications for electricity distributor use.A number of second generation PLC systems with low datarates were proposed in the 1990\u2019s, and Automatic MeterReading systems have been deployed based on this technology.Third generation systems based on OFDM with much higherdata rates are currently being developed and deployed forSmart Grids, Distribution Automation and Advanced MeteringManagement [12].With the development of smart grids, the PLC on thepower transmission and distribution networks have becomeone of the potential technologies to exchange the informationbetween the end users and the utilities. In order to providecommunication services with different priorities under thesmart grid environment, it is a must to design a PLC systemwith variable data rates supported, which means understandingof the PLC physical channel characteristics become vital. Thetesting results in [13] show that the main reason influencingthe reliable communication of high-speed data on power lineis the attenuation of the high-frequency signal, which exhibitsmore obviously in the branch of power line. It is almostimpossible to use the frequency range from 10 to 20 MHzfor the reliable communications from distribution transformerto end user, so it must be solved with the aid of means suchas the repeater and the modulation schemes.Beside the fact that feeder cables are not designed fordata transmission, they are also prone to be interfered bythe inverter\u2019s outcome. Therefore, PLC modems developedfor domestic applications may not be suitable. Limitationsand difficulties that obstruct transmission are revealed in [14].Also, it underlines the possibility of communicating in suchan environment and discusses the possible solutions such asthe use of a pulsewidth modulation filter to overcome thoselimitations.The majority of recent contributions have discussed PLC forhigh-data-rate applications like Internet access or multimediacommunication serving a relatively small number of users.However, it lacks the consideration with PLC as an enabler forsensing, control, and automation in large systems comprisingtens or even hundreds of components spread over relativelywide areas. In [15], the authors discussed communicationnetwork requirements common to such systems and presentedtransmission concepts for PLC to make use of the existingThis article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal. Content is final as presented, with the exception of pagination.YAN et al.: A SURVEY ON SMART GRID COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURES: MOTIVATIONS, REQUIREMENTS AND CHALLENGES 3power transmission and/or distribution infrastructure resources(i.e., power lines) to meet these requirements. In [16] theauthors give an overview of DLC+VIT4IP (Distribution LineCarrier: Verification, Integration and Test of PLC Technologiesand IP Communication for Utilities), a EU funded projectunder the 7th Framework Programme (FP7) that aims toextend the existing PLC technologies by developing efficienttransport of IPv6 protocol, automatic measurement, configu-ration and management, and security. In addition, the projectDLC+VIT4IP also exploits frequency ranges up to 500 kHz,to support systems serving larger smart grid applications.B. Distributed Energy ResourcesThe legacy power generation and transmission concept isconverting to a massively distributed energy generation land-scape integrating an extensive number of variable and smallrenewable energy resources (DERs) such as wind [17]\u2013[19],solar [20]\u2013[22] installations with all their challenging effectson the smart grid.MetaPV [23] is a project demonstrated theprovision of electrical benefits from photovoltaics (PV) on alarge scale, showing the way toward cities powered by renew-able energy sources. The project also demonstrates enhancedcontrol capacities implemented into PV inverters, includingactive voltage control, low-voltage ride-through capability,autonomous grid operation, and interaction of distributionsystem control with PV systems. Smart control should enablean increase of the PV penetration in existing power grids andpromote the use of more renewable energy sources in citiesand industries at minimum additional investment costs. TheMetaPV project is funded by the European Commission inthe 7th Framework Programme, which consists of six partnersfrom four EU countries.New stakeholders (e.g. energy resource aggregators), moreflexibility for the consumers (energy market place), and totallynew concepts (loading of Electric Vehicles (EVs), usage ofEVs as flexible power storage) have to be respected. Innovativemonitoring and control concepts are required to operate thesedistributed energy resources in a reliable and safe way, so thecommunication technologies must support it. A key require-ment for facilitating the distributed production of future gridsis that communication and information are standardized toensure interoperability. For example, the IEC 61850 standard,which was originally aimed at substation automation, has beenexpanded to cover the monitoring and control of DERs. Byhaving a consistent and well-defined data model the standardenables a DER aggregator, such as a Virtual Power Plant(VPP), in communicating with a broad array of DERs. Ifthe data model of IEC 61850 is combined with a set ofcontemporary web protocols, it can result in a major shiftin how DERs can be accessed and coordinated. [24] describeshow IEC 61850 can benefit from the REpresentational StateTransfer (REST) service concept and how a server using thesetechnologies can be used to interface with DERs as diverse asEVs and micro Combined Heat and Power (\u00b5CHP) units.There are some works (e.g., [25]\u2013[27]) in integrating DERgeneration into the traditional centralized carbon fuel basedgeneration power grid. These energy sources include biomassetc. A key observation made in [25] is that existing powergrids were designed in a one-direction radial mode withoutconsidering the communication with the emerging distributedrenewable resource generation. In [26] it discussed the broaderimplications of the social acceptance of these new energy gen-eration technologies, as they represent a significant departurefrom incumbent approach of traditional monolithic large scaleenergy generation. In addition, the implications of regulatoryand economic factors also contribute to potential take-up andvarious deployment models to increase the adoption of thesedistributed renewable resource generators [27].Every DER includes an Electronic Power Processor (EPP)to govern the power exchange with the smart grid andSwitching Power Interface (SPI) to control the currents drawnfrom the smart grid. Such distributed EPPs and SPIs shouldperform cooperatively to take full advantage of smart gridpotentiality (exploitation of renewable energy sources, powerquality and transmission efficiency). To achieve this goal dif-ferent approaches can be adopted, depending on the availablecommunication capability. In [28] it discussed various controlsolutions applicable in absence of supervisory control, e.g.,in residential micro-grids, where communication is possiblebetween neighbor units only (surround control) or is notavailable at all (plug & play control). In micro-grids, wherenumber and type of DERs and loads is unpredictable and mayvary during time, cooperative operation can be achieved bysimple cross-communication among neighbor EPPs, withoutcentralized supervisor. In [29], it describes principles of co-operative operations with existing information and communi-cation architectures, which allows exploitation of micro-gridcapabilities without additional infrastructure investments.C. Smart MeteringThe Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is a key factorin the smart grid which is the architecture for automated,two-way communications between a smart utility meter and autility company. A smart meter is an advanced meter whichidentifies power consumption in much more detail than a con-ventional meter and communicates the collected informationback to the utility for load monitoring and billing purposes.Consumers can be informed of how much power they areusing so that they could control their power consumptionand the consequent carbon dioxide emission. By managingthe peak load through consumer participation, the utility willlikely provide electricity at lower and even rates for all.AMI has already gained great attraction within the industry,with the advantages in accuracy and process improvement ofon-line meter reading and control. In [30], additional benefitsare suggested to be gained in managing power quality andasset management with AMI. This paper also discussed howreliability, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction canbe addressed with an AMI deployment. However, the benefitsof AMI are countered by increasing cyber security issues [31].The technologies require a communication infrastructure toprovide interconnectivity. Hence, the vulnerabilities that ex-pose other internetworking systems will ultimately lead tosecurity threats to AMI systems.This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal. Content is final as presented, with the exception of pagination.4 IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS, ACCEPTED FOR PUBLICATIOND. Monitoring and ControllingSCADA systems have been implemented to monitor andcontrol electrical power grids for decades. The industrialexperience shows that practical deployment of SCADA basedsystems may restrict it to the high voltage transmission net-works only. In [32] the authors made the observation thatexisting monitoring and control systems are restricted to the(high-voltage) transmission network and not suitable for largerscale monitoring and control of the entire electrical grid. Adistributed monitoring control system is proposed to managethe power grid. A grid computing solution is proposed toaddress these monitoring control needs and the results of theresearch for an off-line test environment is discussed. Thekey motivations also include the need to support sustainableand renewable energy source at the micro-generation level. AsSCADA systems evolve, there is much interest in exploringthe security vulnerabilities posed to these systems over com-munication network and/or internet technologies [33]\u2013[35].In [36], the solution applies existing Information andCommunication Technology (ICT) systems in a hierarchi-cal decomposition of the power grid into logical zones formonitoring and control. It outlines the impact to the controlcenter responsible for management and control of the electricalnetwork. It also proposes a framework for future control centerin order to monitor and manage the smart grid. The EUFP6 project ADINE [37] is based on the Active NetworkManagement (ANM) concept, where automation, ICT andpower electronics are used to integrate more distributed gener-ators by exploiting active resources instead of just reinforcingthe network. The resources are mobilized through ancillaryservices or requirements. Five enabling solutions within ANMare pushed forward in the project: Protection relay and faultlocation applications, coordinated protection planning, voltagecontrol with microturbine, centralized voltage control withSCADA/DMS.The rest of this paper is organized as follows: the keymotivations of smart grid communication infrastructures arediscussed in section II. Several industrial trials are shown insection III. The detailed requirements are presented in sectionIV. The challenges are discussed in section V. Conclusions aredrawn in section VI.II. MOTIVATIONSIn this section, we briefly highlight the key motivationsof communication infrastructures in smart grid systems. Asillustrated in Figure 2, the motivations are related to system,operation and environment aspects in emerging smart gridparadigm through communication infrastructures [38].A. Enhanced Customer ExperienceA key objective for communication infrastructures in smartgrid systems is to improve service reliability and quality tocustomers which includes reduced outage times when a powersystem is interrupted, improved notification of electricity net-work problems and providing customers with proper optionsand tools to understand and optimize their energy usage tocurtail the peak-hour usage to avoid power quality degradationor blackout [39].EnvironmentSystemOperationEnhanced Customer ExperienceIncreased ProductivityImproved UtilizationLower Carbon Fuel Consumption/Greenhouse Gas EmissionFacilitated Renewable Resource GenerationAdherence to Regulatory ConstraintsCommunication InfrastructureFig. 2. Motivations of Smart Grid Communication Infrastructures [38]B. Increased ProductivityIntelligent performance information and tools will allowutilities to undertake their current duties in a more efficientmanner, with longer term benefits coming from automatingthe smart grid. These gains in productivity will help to reducedeployment costs and operational costs in managing the smartgrid system [40].C. Improved UtilizationThe communication infrastructure in smart grid will pro-vide detailed real-time data on distributed energy generation,electricity transmission, power consumption and market price.This information allows the utility operators to improve theirdecision making processes by identifying which componentsare likely to fail and the replacement strategy online [41].D. Lower Carbon Fuel Consumption/Greenhouse Gas Emis-sionA smart grid has the potential to reduce electricity lossesin the network and limit growth in demand, due to embeddedmonitoring of the high, medium and low voltage networksthrough communication infrastructures, therefore, lower car-bon fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emission [42].E. Facilitated Renewable Resource GenerationA smart grid will enable options for renewable generationand provide customers with the awareness and capabilities toreduce their energy consumption on carbon fuel based power[43].F. Adherence to Regulatory ConstraintsNew regulatory demands include provisions for increasedlevels of asset data tracking (cost justification), and greaterreliability targeting the implementation of communicationinfrastructure in smart grid [44].This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

Energy Web Infrastructure [45]III. CASE STUDIESThe industry has recently undergone a significant trans-formation of their ICT systems to support both current andfuture business models of smart grid operations. Moreover,the power industry is transforming from the traditional modelsof business to embrace a number of new and enhancedtechnologies that support future smart grid operations. Thissection summaries several smart grid industry projects whichinclude energy web infrastructure for power generation andelectricity market information exchange, smart metering in-frastructure which support monitoring and retrieving bothreal-time and historical data, smart community for real-timepower consumption monitoring and managing, ZigBee-basedrecording system with capability for consumers to view andmanage their power consumption online, and future controlcenter for power generation and distribution managing anddeciding between utilities through public networks such asinternet.A. Energy WebThe increasing electricity demand and sustainable devel-opment of renewable energy resources offer opportunitiesfor both utilities, brokers, customers to participate into thedevelopment of the emerging energy web. The basic idea ofenergy web is to use the Internet to gain bandwidth, reliabilityand interconnection for the smart grid. It realizes the on-demand and demand response in local area by establishingthe balance of power generation and consumption.In Figure 3, each power generator is interconnected withan adapted power supplier which has the proper capability ofinterpreting the real-time price signal received from the energyweb infrastructure [45]. In order to match the consumption andgeneration, the participant strategy is adapted. In the powermarket model, each electricity user has option to become apower generator. The electricity price is generated real-timeand sent to every participants by utility operators using thesmart grid communication infrastructure from the electricitymarket. The electricity flows generated by the participantsare monitored in real-time mode by utility operators whoalso operate the real-time metering infrastructures such asautomatic meter reading (AMR) or AMI for establishingthe energy demand and supply balance. While the historicalrecords of both the power consumption and generation withtheir corresponding price are periodically sent to the relatedoffices of the participants for financial settlement.B. Smart Metering and InfrastructureBC Hydro [46] is launching a smart metering and infras-tructure (SMI) program. A multi-level common and integratedcommunication infrastructure to enable grid modernizationis planned as illustrated in Figure 4. That means the com-munication infrastructure will not only support automatedmeter readings, customer home appliance connections, butalso future distribution automation, substation automation andpossibly mobile workforce management and other advancedapplications which utilities could envision in the life span (20years) of AMI infrastructure. This conforms to the industryvision of integrating communication and IT networks with thepower delivery system, in order to provide system sensing andcontrol capability [47].This long term vision raises several key questions: Howmuch data traffic will flow in the network and how muchbandwidth should be planned for the communication network,especially for the wide area communication network? Howmuch of the legacy communication network for system controlpurposes (e.g., SCADA system) can be leveraged to deliver acost effective solution? These questions are addressed basedThis article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

High Level Common Communication Infrastructure Architecture [47]on the expected new applications and with communicationand control technology development and system life cycle costminimization in mind.C. Smart CommunityA smart community trial deploys automated metering de-vices into customer\u2019s household. It may include gas, waterand electricity automated metering. The smart communitytrial provides customers new tools to manage their energyconsumption hence reduce the related carbon footprint.Figure 5 provides an overview of the components. Thetrial involves the deployment to the scale of 1,000 housesthat communicate using WiMax to several IT systems whichmanage the reading of water, gas, and electricity. Customerscan access to an information portal via Home Area Networks(HAN). This may be accessed by an in-house display panelor the software based interfaces via the PDA, smart phone orhome personal computer.The home energy consumption is monitored by those ap-pliances enabled with intelligent chips which may support theremote control of appliances operation from Internet. Supportfor electrical vehicles will also be provided for home. The datagathered from this trial can be made available further to thepublic, universities, and researchers for the energy efficiencyand environmental protection.The detailed data on measurements, events, and faults canbe viewed in an example in [48]. In order to retrieve thehistorical measurement data, the solution will be able todisplay the topology of network at selected historical timepoints. While the high voltage transmission network is usuallyFig. 5. Smart Community: Automated Metering Infrastructure [48]static in terms of its network configuration, the medium andlow voltage networks are considerably more volatile. Hence,such a historical network view will provide further input tothe central control to assist in diagnosing network faults, andwill also assist operators and engineers in the design of thesmart grid communication infrastructure.D. A ZigBee-Based Recording SystemZigBee has been designed as a low-cost and low-power-consumption wireless communication standard by ZigBeeThis article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal. Content is final as presented, with the exception of pagination.YAN et al.: A SURVEY ON SMART GRID COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURES: MOTIVATIONS, REQUIREMENTS AND CHALLENGES 7Fig. 6. System Architecture of a ZigBee-based Smart Meter RecordingSystem [53]Alliance [49]. The ZigBee application profile includes homeautomation, industrial plant monitoring, commercial build-ing automation, automatic meter reading, telecom servicese-commerce, wireless sensor networks, personal and home areanetworks [50]\u2013[52].A smart power-meter and a back-end processing systemare proposed in [53] to be equipped with ZigBee devicesand ZigBee coordinators respectively. With the automaticnetworking characteristic of ZigBee, smart power meter serv-ing as a node apparatus will communicate with the ZigBeecoordinator of rear-end processing system and ZigBee networkcan then be constructed to accomplish the meter-readingfunction. After the ZigBee network was constructed, the rear-end processing system can send the request commands to theZigBee coordinators and receive the power consumption dataand outage event data from the power meters. Therefore, theautomatic meter reading can be accomplished. The conceptof the proposed outage recording system is illustrated inFigure 6 while an example of real-time data acquisition isshown in [53].E. Future Control CenterIn [54], the authors proposed a vision to design and developthe next-generation monitoring, analysis, and control technolo-gies to move the industry towards a smarter transmission grid.As shown in Figure 7, the vision for future control centers,also referred to as smart control centers, can be a critical partof the overall framework of the future smart grid. This visionhas five key characteristics as discussed in the following.1) Human-Centered Online Monitoring: Human-centeredis the key characteristic of the next-generation monitoringfunctions in the future smart control centers. In this context,human-centered has two meanings: information-directed andcustomized. The next generation monitoring functions shallprovide operators useful information rather than raw data.With more and more deployment of monitoring devices (e.g.,equipment health sensors), it now has more data available tohelp system operators monitor the power system conditionin real time. However, more data does not necessarily meanmore information. We need to transform the huge volume ofdata into useful information. It is the operators responsibilityto define what information is needed. Since the informationis presented to system operators who are human beings,the monitoring functions shall employ advanced visualizationtechniques with the goal of helping each operator to digestinformation quickly.2) Comprehensive Online Analysis: The next-generationonline analysis functions shall help system operators deter-mine comprehensive operating boundaries in real time. Com-prehensive operating boundaries include both thermal limitsand stability (voltage stability and transient stability) limits.The next-generation online analysis functions shall ap-ply a comprehensive approach to help system operators de-termine the operating boundaries. Comprehensive approachmeans combination of a simulation-based approach and ameasurement-based approach.3) From Reactive Analysis to Proactive Analysis: Thepresent online analysis is based on the current operatingcondition. This does not consider future system conditions.In the future, online analysis shall take a proactive approachto perform look-ahead simulation on the future system condi-tions.The integration of renewable energy sources will introducemore uncertainties into the power system. With the abilityto foresee potential problems, the next-generation proactiveonline analysis will optimize resources (such as demandresponse and energy storage) in order to improve reliabilityand achieve economic operation.By enabling sufficient foresight, the next-generation anal-ysis functions allow system operators to take a proactiveapproach to develop optimal control strategies and mitigationplans.4) From Isolated Protection and Control Strategy to Coor-dinated Protection and Control Strategy: Traditionally, eachcontrol scheme is designed to solve a particular problem.The parameters were developed based on offline simulationsand largely remain fixed. There is a lack of coordinationamong protection and control systems. As modern powersystems have become more interconnected with increasingstress levels, each disturbance may cause multiple protectionand control schemes to respond. There may exist negativeinteractions that can worsen system conditions, which presentchallenges and risks in system operations.When a power system experiences a disturbance, the nextgeneration coordinated protection and control systems willperform according to the optimal control strategies developedby online security assessment and shall quickly bring thesystem to a stable operating condition with minimum controlefforts.5) Self-Healing System Control: The current restorationplans are developed through offline studies based on as-sumptions regarding likely scenarios. However, the restorationstrategy developed from such studies may not work wellThis article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal. Content is final as presented, with the exception of pagination.8 IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS, ACCEPTED FOR PUBLICATIONFig. 7. Scopes of Future Control Center [54]following a blackout because the real operational situation mayvary from the assumed scenarios.When part or all of the power system is blacked out, thenext generation self-healing control scheme shall effectivelyrestore the system and bring it back to a normal operatingcondition.IV. REQUIREMENTSMonitoring/sensing, communication and control are thethree fundamental building blocks that will convert a powerdistribution system into a smart grid. Monitoring/sensing willhave the ability to detect malfunctions or deviations fromnormal operational ranges that would warrant actions. Further,since in a smart grid, a point of electricity consumption canalso become a point of generation, the sensing process willbe closely linked with the metering process. Communicationswill allow inputs from sensors to be conveyed to the control el-ements in the smart grid which will generate control messagesfor transmission to various points in the smart grid resultingin appropriate actions. The communication infrastructure hasto be robust enough to accept inputs from a user and make itan integral part of the process. By the same token, the usermust be capable of getting the appropriate level of informationfrom the smart grid. The major requirements for smart gridcommunication infrastructures are discussed in the rest of thissection.A. QoSIn order to realize a practical smart grid communicationinfrastructure, it is necessary to have guaranteed Quality ofService (QoS) for the communication and networking tech-nology used in the smart grid, ranging from power generation,transmission, distribution, to the customer applications.1) Latency: The real-time operational data communicationsin smart grid include online sensor/meter reading and powersystem control signals. The communication is characterizedby the fact that most of interactions must take place in realtime, with hard time bound. The communication require-ments define the design of the technical solutions. For real-time sensing/metering purposes, reading messages should betransmitted within a very short time frame. For instance, themaximum allowed time is in the range of 12-20 ms, dependingon the type of protection scheme which origins from thefact that the disconnection of fault current should withinapproximately 100 ms. Power System Control signals mainlyinclude supervisory control of the power process on secondaryor higher levels. These systems are of the kind SCADA/EMS.Measured values must not be older than 15 seconds, whenarriving at the control center. Breaking information shallarrive no later than 2 seconds after the emergency event hasoccurred [55].2) Bandwidth: As more and more interconnected intelli-gent elements are added to the electricity network with theevolution of the smart grid, the communication infrastruc-ture should be able to transport more and more messagessimultaneously without severe effect on latency. The networkbandwidth must increase faster than the demand of theseinterconnected intelligent elements in the network.C. H. Hauser et al. concluded in [56] that a 10 millisecondaverage latency for a 400 bit message using a T1 line willresult in a utilization of only 6% of the T1 bandwidth. In [55]the authors modeled the communication bandwidth require-ments for a moderate size electricity distribution system. Inthis model, a distribution substation is connected to 10,000feeders and each feeder connects to 10 customers. Assumingthat every electric meter generates a message every secondto the distribution substation, the total is 100,000 messagesper second. The feeders themselves will generate messagesto each other and to the distribution substation. The authorsin [55] modeled the messages in the smart grid arriving atservers located at the control center as M/M/1 traffic. Then,the transmission line bandwidth is evaluated over 100 Mbpsthrough the M/M/1 queuing model. It can be observed that thissituation results in a very poor bandwidth utilization of thetransmission facilities as well. Unfortunately, a higher levelof utilization will not permit meeting the assumed latencyconstraint.B. InteroperabilityInteroperability of a smart grid is the ability of diversesystems to work together, use the compatible parts, exchangeinformation or equipment from each other, and work coop-eratively to perform tasks. It enables integration, effectivecooperation, and two-way communications among the manyinterconnected elements of the smart grid. The National Insti-tute for Standards and Technology (NIST) works as the firstInternational Coordinator for smart grid interoperability [57].NIST developed a framework that includes protocols andstandards for information management to achieve interoper-ability of smart grid devices and systems [58]. NIST hasdeveloped a three phase approach to identify smart grid stan-dards. Phase 1 addresses the engagement of stakeholders ina participatory public process to identify applicable standardsand gaps in currently available standards and priorities for newstandardization activities, ending with the final publication ofthe framework report after public comments have been incor-porated. Phase 2 will establish a private-public partnership andform a smart grid interoperability panel to drive longer-termprogress. Phase 3 will develop and implement a frameworkfor testing and certification of how standards are implementedin smart grid devices, systems, and processes.This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

NIST Conceptual Model [59]As illustrated in Figure 8, the NIST conceptual referencemodel identifies seven domains as bulk generation, trans-mission, distribution, markets, operations, service providers,and customers and major actors and applications within each.The reference model also identifies interfaces among domainsand actors and applications over which information mustbe exchanged and for which interoperability standards areneeded.For years, the utility industry has been using optical portcommunications, defined by ANSI C12.18, and telephonemodem communications, defined by ANSI C12.21, to getmetering data, defined by ANSI C12.19, from the field tothe back office. While the two communication standards havebeen employed to great success, the missing was a standardmethod for using true network communications for exchangingthe data. Recent work has completed by ANSI C12.22, astandard for interfacing the data communication networks, aswell as updating the optical port and modem communicationstandards. This set of standards offers the industry an open andcomprehensive protocol suite to transport the newly reviseddata standard, ANSI C12.19 [60].C. ScalabilityA smart grid communication infrastructure needs the scala-bility of accommodating more and more devices and servicesinto it and more end-user interaction real-time monitoringof energy meters. As discussed by Lobo et al. [61], anIP-based network will provide an effective solution for thecommunication needs of the smart grid. An IP-based networkas the backbone makes use of new technologies independent ofthe service implemented by the distributed network operator.The cost of deployment and maintenance can be reducedsignificantly using IP-based technologies.D. SecurityAccording to the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI),one of the emergent requirements facing the smart grid devel-opment is related to cyber security of systems. As indicatedin the EPRI report [62], cyber security is a critical issuedue to the increasing potential of cyber attacks and incidentsagainst this critical sector as it becomes more and moreinterconnected. Cyber security must address not only delib-erate attacks, such as from disgruntled employees, industrialespionage, and terrorists, but also inadvertent compromises ofthe information infrastructure due to user errors, equipmentfailures, and natural disasters. Vulnerabilities might allowan attacker to penetrate a network, gain access to controlsoftware, and alter load conditions to destabilize the grid inunpredictable ways.There are many organizations working on the developmentof smart grid security requirements including North Amer-ican Electrical Reliability Corporation-Critical InfrastructureProtection (NERC-CIP), ISA, IEEE (1402), the National In-frastructure Protection Plan (NIPP), and NIST [63].One prominent source of requirements is the Smart GridInteroperability Panel (SGiP) Cyber Security Working Group,previously NIST Cyber Security Coordination Task Group(CSCTG). NIST CSCTG was established to ensure the con-sistency in the cyber security requirements across all thesmart grid domains and components. The draft document fromthe CSWG, NIST interagency Report (NIST IR) 7628 [64],continues to evolve. NIST and DoE Gridwise ArchitectureCouncil (GWAC) [65] has established Domain Expert WorkingGroups (DEWGs) [66]: Home-to-Grid (H2G), Building-to-Grid (B2G), Industrial-to-Grid (I2G), Transmission and Dis-tribution (T&D) and Business and Policy (B&P). Furthermore,many other standards may apply, including ISO 17799 [67],FIPS 201 [68], other NIST SPs, and DISA Security TechnicalImplementation Guides (STIGs) [69]. Working with standardsbodies, such as NIST and others, will be extremely importantto ensure a highly secure, scalable, consistently deployedsmart grid communication system, as these standards bodieswill drive the security requirements of the smart grid commu-nication systems [70].One thing is consistent among the various standards bodies:the security of the smart grid communications will stronglydepend on authentication, authorization, and privacy technolo-gies. Privacy technologies are well matured. Federal Infor-mation Processing Standard (FIPS) has approved AdvancedEncryption Standard (AES) and Triple Data Encryption Algo-rithm (3DES) solutions, offering strong security and high per-formance, are readily available. The specific privacy solutionsrequired will depend on the type of communication resourcebeing protected. As a specific example, NIST has determinedthat 3DES solution will likely become insecure by the year2030. Considering that utility components are expected to havelong lifetimes, AES would be the preferred solution for newcomponents. However, it is expected the legacy functionalitysuch as 3DES must be supported for system compatibility,therefore there is a risk of compromising the system [71].Wireless links will be secured with technologies from wellknown standards such as 802.11i [72] and 802.16e [73].Different wireless protocols have varying degrees of securitymechanisms. Wired links will be secured with the technologiessuch as firewalls, virtual private networks (VPN) and IPSec.Higher layer security mechanism such as Secure Shell (SSH)and Security Socket Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security(TLS) should also be used. System architects and designersoften identify the need for and specify the use of secureprotocols, such as SSH and IPSec, but then skip the detailsassociated with establishing security associations between endpoints of communications. Such an approach is likely to resultin a system where the necessary procedures for secure keymanagement can quickly become an operational nightmare. ItThis article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal. Content is final as presented, with the exception of pagination.10 IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS, ACCEPTED FOR PUBLICATIONis due to the fact that, when system architects do not developan integrated and comprehensive key management scheme,customers may be provided with few key management options,and often resort to manually pre-configuring symmetric keys.This approach is simple for the system designers, but it canbe very expensive for the system owner/operator.What has been learned from years of deploying and oper-ating large secure network communication systems is that theefforts required to provision symmetric keys into thousandsof devices can be too expensive or insecure. The developmentof key and trust management schemes for large networkdeployments is required; these systems can be leveraged fromother industries, such as mobile radio systems and Associa-tion of Public-Safety Communications Officials (APCO) radiosystems. Several APCO-deployed systems provide statewidewireless coverage, with tens of thousands of secure de-vices [74]. Trust management systems, based on public-keyinfrastructure (PKI) technology, could be customized specifi-cally for smart grid operators, easing the burden of providingsecurity which adheres to the standards and guidelines that areknown to be secure.All of the above technologies rely on some sort of keymanagement. Considering that the smart grid will containmillions of devices, spread across hundreds of organizations,the key management systems used must be scalable to ex-traordinary levels. Further, key management must offer strongsecurity (authentication and authorization), inter-organizationinteroperability, and the highest possible levels of efficiencyto ensure that unnecessary cost due to overhead, provisioning,and maintenance are minimized. It is likely that new keymanagement systems (specialized to meet the requirementsof smart grid) will be needed.E. StandardizationThe smart grid involves various standards in many fieldssuch as power generation, delivery and control besides com-munications. IEEE has recently taken the initiative to definethese standards and write guidelines on how the smart gridshould operate using the latest technology in power engi-neering, control, communications, and information technology.The standards group that was created is known as the IEEEP2030 group [75]. Three task forces were formed to tackle dis-tribution systems including the integration of different energysources, transmission substations, load side requirements, andcyber security. These task forces will focus on power engineer-ing technology, information technology, and communicationtechnology. The power engineering technology group willwork on the functional requirements of interoperability, draw-ing on various existing and ongoing efforts by groups such asInternational Society of Automation (ISA) and InternationalElectrotechnical Commission (IEC). IEC TC57 WG13 [76]is currently drafting the new international standards for usein improving overall transmission grid reliability and security.This work directly supports the NIST smart grid interoperabil-ity.The information technology group will look at the issuesof privacy, security, data integrity, interfaces, and interoper-ability. The communication technology group will define thecommunication requirements between devices in the smartgrid and establish boundaries for generation, transmission, anddistribution in conjunction with the customers [77].Implementing standards is a major issue in transitioningtowards advanced sensing/automation, and also is a crucialstep in creating smart grid communication infrastructure. Ascommunication systems in smart grid are usually from differ-ent vendors with their own legacies, which are proprietaryand have no dual interoperability. The identified standardswhich govern the necessary integration of different functionsare specified by IEC.V. CHALLENGESThe proliferation of wireless/wired sensors and communi-cation devices and the emergence of embedded computingrepresents an opportunity to develop applications for con-nected environments in general, and especially managementsystems that address urgent challenges facing the smart gridcommunication infrastructure. The challenges include the de-ployment of large-scale embedded computing, legacy powergrids, intelligent appliances, and next-generation communi-cations and collaborations that will provide the foundationfor a post-carbon society. In this section, we discuss thecontext that gives these challenges urgency as well as thetechnical challenges that need to be addressed by smart gridcommunication infrastructures.A. ComplexityA smart grid communication infrastructure is a systemof systems and it is extremely complex. As a consequence,modeling, analysis and design a suitable communication in-frastructure meet many new challenges. The models to beused must be capable of accounting for uncertainty as away to simulate emerging behavior. The numerical tools toperform the analysis must be capable of solving very largescale problems. In fact, the power system is tightly coupledand non-linear [78] and does not benefit from the sparsity thattypically characterized this problem. The control system andparticularly communication infrastructure must be designedto manage uncertainty and inconsistencies to be resilient orgracefully degrade when necessary. Finally the performancemetric must be adjusted to the new nature of the powersystem. The challenges in modeling the complexity of asmart grid communication infrastructure are summarized inthe following.1) Need to support multi-physics approach: Systems are sotightly interconnected that is not possible to simply simulatethe electrical subsystem [79]2) Need to support multidisciplinary approach: Differentusers will have to work at the same scenario, each of themfocusing on different aspects (control, power flow, communi-cations) [80], [81].3) Need to support dynamic and reconfigurable model leveldefinition: This is probably the most challenging element.While different users interact with the simulation schematicthey need to focus on different details of the system. Thenext generation simulation system should support this processautomatically [82], [83].This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal. Content is final as presented, with the exception of pagination.YAN et al.: A SURVEY ON SMART GRID COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURES: MOTIVATIONS, REQUIREMENTS AND CHALLENGES 114) Need to provide high-level graphic visualization to sup-port system: While engineers may want to focus on thedetails of graphs, system analysis requires different types ofvisualization able to synthesize a \u201csystem-picture\u201d [84].5) Need to provide support for uncertainty propagation:Uncertainty is presented in the power system for differentreasons and from various sources. And therefore it is to beaccounted for in the design and in the operation, as it will bedependent on static and dynamic state estimation [85].B. EfficiencyRealization of the future smart grid requires meeting theever increasing efficiency challenges by harnessing moderncommunication and information technologies to enable acommunication infrastructure that provides grid-wide coor-dinated monitoring and control capabilities. Such commu-nication infrastructure should be capable of providing failproof and nearly instantaneous bidirectional communicationsamong all devices ranging from individual loads to the grid-wide control centers including all important equipment at theelectricity distribution and transmission system. This involvesprocessing vast number of data transactions for analysis andautomation. It requires a high performance communicationinfrastructure capable of providing fast intelligent local sub-second responses coordinated with a higher level global anal-ysis in order to prevent or contain rapidly evolving adverseevents [86]. It needs to meet the challenges in the following.1) Better Telemetry: Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU)technology [87] can offer faster, time-stamped, higher ac-curacy and sub-second scanning to enable timely grid-widesituational awareness [87].2) Faster Controls: Based on power electronics, smart gridcommunication infrastructure enables fast automated controlactions, for voltage and power flow management at electricitygeneration, transmission and distribution systems.3) More Robust Controls: Proactive and adaptive adjust-ment of protection and communication settings for wide areamonitoring and controls support intentional islanding, whichis beyond currently employed ad-hoc schemes in systemprotection.4) Embedded Intelligent Device Communications: To en-able adaptive and intelligent communications for device levelfault diagnosis and bad data identification, operations and theconstraints should be prescribed by system operators or controlcenters, intelligent remedial action scheme (RAS)/system pro-tection schemes (SPS), autonomous restoration of equipmentand autonomous local control actions [88].5) Integrated and Secure Communications: Highly dis-tributed and pervasive communications based on open stan-dards allow flexible network configurability to assure fail-proof monitoring and automation for bidirectional communi-cations between all operators and customers.6) Enhanced Computing Capabilities: Fail-proof and se-cure communication systems for reliable analysis supportoperator decisions and autonomous intelligent agents a geo-graphically and temporally coordinated hierarchy through thegrid-wide communication infrastructure [89].7) Internet Technology: Internet protocols to facilitate dataexchange, process control and cyber security implement adistributed architecture with open interfaces. Plug-and-playhardware and software components in a service oriented archi-tecture is based on communication standards and technologiessuch as message oriented middleware and web services toenable seamless integration of the IT infrastructure rangingfrom lowest equipment level Intelligent Electronic Devices(IEDs) to all higher application levels [90].C. ReliabilityA framework for cohesive integration of reliability tech-nologies facilitate convergence of the needed standards andprotocols, and implementation of necessary analytical capabil-ities. This subsection reviews the impact of a communicationinfrastructure to the reliability of a smart grid. An ideal mixof the current communication and control techniques are ex-pected to lead a flatter net demand that eventually accentuatesmany reliability issues further. A grid-wide communicationarchitectural framework to meet these reliability challengesare discussed in the following [91].1) Renewable Resources: Renewable resources generallyhave adverse challenges on smart grid reliability due to thefollowing factors: variability and low capacity, factors makingthe net demand profile steeper, low correlation with the loadprofile especially in the case of wind resource, relativelyhigh forecast errors especially for longer horizons, congestionissues at transmission level due to large installations andat distribution level due to dispersed resources. Operationalperformance issues such as voltage and regulation.To address the variability of the net demand, as renewableresources growing over the long run, efficient communica-tion infrastructure for information exchange among demandresponse, storage devices and utilization of plug-in electricvehicles (PEVs)/plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) willcomplement the remedies [92].2) Demand Response: Demand response allows consumerload reduction in response to emergency and high price con-ditions on the smart grid. Such conditions are more prevalentduring peak load or congested operation as illustrated inFigure 9 [93]. Non-emergency demand response in the rangeof 5% to 15% of system peak load can provide substantialbenefits in reducing the need for additional resources andlowering real-time electricity prices [2]. Demand responsedoes not substantially change the total energy consumptionsince a large fraction of the energy saved during the loadcurtailment period is consumed at a more opportune time -thus a flatter load.3) Load Management: Load rejection as an emergencyresource to protect the smart grid from disruption is wellunderstood and is implemented to operate either by systemoperator command or through under-frequency and/or under-voltage relays. In a smart grid, the load rejection schemes canbe enhanced to act more intelligently and based on customerparticipation.Price based demand response/load management as a systemresource to balance demand and supply has not been widelyadopted yet. Contract based participation has been typicallyThis article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

Communications for Demand Response [93]below 5% of peak load [94]. In a smart grid, real-timeprice information enables wider voluntary participation byconsumers. Demand response can be implemented througheither automatic or manual response to price signals, orthrough a bidding process based on direct communicationsbetween the consumers and the market/system operators orthrough intermediaries such as aggregators or local utilities.4) Storage Devices: Most of the existing storage resourcesare hydro and pumped storage. However, growth potential forthese resources is much smaller than the need for storagenecessary to counter growing net demand variability presentedby new wind and solar resources. Various storage technologiesare emerging to fill the gap. Battery storage appears to bemost promising due to improvements in technology as well aseconomies of scale.Storage resources tend to make the net demand profile flatterand, as such, are expected to improve reliability. In addition,most battery storage devices can respond in time scales ofseconds. Hence they can become valuable enablers of fastcontrols in a smart grid. Storage resources of various sizescan be distributed throughout the grid ranging from end userloads to major substations and central power stations. Thisfeature can help to alleviate congestion at both transmissionand distribution levels [95].5) Electric Transportation: Plug-in electric vehicles (PEV,PHEV, etc.) continue to become more popular as environmen-tal concerns increase. They are a significant means to reducegreen house gases and reliance on fossil fuels. They will be asignificant factor in load growth with a potential to eventuallyconsume 600 TWh/year assuming 30 kwh for a 100-miletrip [96], and 10,000 miles per year for 200 million vehiclesin the U.S. For greater adoption of all-electric vehicles, theissue of recharge time has to be resolved. Long recharge timeslead to generally unacceptable level of vehicle unavailabilityand short recharge times have potential to increase congestion,especially at the distribution levels [97].From reliability viewpoint, electric transportation has fea-tures similar to both demand response resources and storageresources. As PHEVs present a significant factor of loadgrowth, this can also aggravate the demand variability andassociated reliability problems depending on the chargingschemes and consumer behavioral patterns.D. SecurityBased on the evolution of power system communicationinfrastructures and the concern of cyber security, many newissues have arisen in the context of smart grid.Fig. 10. Information Security Domains [99]1) Information Security Domains: Since the SCADA/EMSsystems have become increasingly integrated, it becomes moredifficult to treat the system structure in terms of parts orsubsystems. The physical realization of various functions isless evident from a user perspective. Instead, it becomes morenatural to study a SCADA/EMS system in terms of domains.This concept in application to power systems was introducedin [98].A domain is a specific area, wherein specific activ-ities/business operations are going on and they can begrouped together. The security domains are introduced inFigure 10 [99].When communicating across power utilities, different or-ganizations and companies, using communication networks,the security domains should be recognized. For example, apower utility company could define a security domain andrelated policies and procedures for its telecontrol activity toassure compliance with legislative or regulatory requirements.If similar definitions, procedures, policies, etc. were developedby other power utility companies, it would be easier to discussand define common rules for the information exchange or theusage of common resources in a communication infrastructure.However today, there are no common definitions including theterm security. Also, there are no common control system secu-rity policies or procedures, although groups such as IEC [100],ISA [101], and NIST [102], [103], are working on genericpolicies and procedures.2) Government Coordination on SCADA Security: A gov-ernment coordination action between different authorities andagencies were started in [104], focusing on SCADA secu-rity. The action is based on the participation of the powerutilities, water companies, and railway systems, which haveSCADA systems as the critical part of operations. Also,the security policies are represented. Here, the expertise isgathered and experiences are shared, including both domesticand international knowledge; everything with the purposeof securing the SCADA systems being part of the criticalinformation infrastructures. As a natural step, the SCADA Se-curity Guideline has been developed in [105]. Also, technicalguidelines and administrative recommendations are developedwhich are available for free downloading, that support thesecuring actions of the SCADA systems in the different areasof operations: power, water, and transportation.3) De-Coupling Between Operational SCADA/EMS andAdmin IT: When the existing SCADA/EMS systems are beingThis article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

Vulnerable Access Points to SCADA System [99]refurbished or replaced, the information and IT security issuesmust be taken into account. If a SCADA/EMS system is to berefurbished, the operational SCADA/EMS system part must beshielded from the administrative part, such that the operationalpart is protected from digital threats that are possible overthe Internet connection. If a SCADA/EMS system is to bereplaced, it is then a good occasion to reconsider an overallsystem structure, and then incorporate IT security on allSCADA/EMS levels. A way towards this more secure state isto, if possible, de-couple the operational SCADA/EMS systemand the administrative IT system. Also, an alternative may beto secure the firewall configuration in between operational andadministrative parts.4) Threats: The fact that SCADA/EMS systems are nowbeing interconnected and integrated with external systemscreates new possibilities and threats in cyber security. Someof these new issues have been emphasized in [98] and [106].The various interconnections of a substation were investigatedin [107], as shown in Figure 11. All the numbered accesspoints (1-10) elucidates the possible points where to thesubstation can be accessed. This number creates an operationalenvironment that implies possible digital entrances and hencedigital vulnerabilities at the same time.5) Vulnerability: As presented in [108], using a wirelesssensor network (WSN) in AMI in a smart grid is so vulnerableto be attacked by an intelligent adversary even with anordinary microwave stove. Brodsky et al. [109] documenteda denial-of-service attack on IEEE 802.15.4 wireless sensornetworks used within the smart grid. The equipment neededfor such an attack is inexpensive (about $70).6) Privacy: The privacy of terminal customers and smartmetering networks is important to the eventual acceptance bythe public. Research in this area is going on and smart meterusers will need to be reassured that their data is secure. In[110] the authors describe a method for securely anonymizingfrequent (e.g., every few minutes) electrical metering datasent by a smart meter. Although such frequent metering datamay be required by a utility or electrical energy distributionnetwork for operational reasons, this data may not necessarilyneed to be attributable to a specific smart meter or consumer.However, it needs to be securely attributable to a specificlocation (e.g. a group of houses or apartments) within thesmart grid.VI. CONCLUSIONIn this paper, we presented the background and motivationfor smart grid communication infrastructures. We showed thata smart grid built on the technologies of sensing, communica-tions, and control technologies offer a very promising futurefor utilities and users. We reviewed several industrial trialsand summarized the basic requirements of communicationinfrastructures in smart grid paradigm. Efficiency, reliabilityand security of interconnected devices and systems are criticalto enabling smart grid communication infrastructures. Interop-erability must be achieved while avoiding being isolated intononcompetitive technical solutions and the need for wholesalereplace of existing power communication systems. Alignmentbehind technical standards must be balanced with creating anenvironment that encourages innovation so that the overallcommunication infrastructure may continue to evolve. Basedon the above survey, we can focus on those challenges to smartgrid communication infrastructures in both system design andoperations to make it more efficient and secure.REFERENCES[1] U.S. Department of Energy, [online] Available: www.oe.energy.gov.This article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.
