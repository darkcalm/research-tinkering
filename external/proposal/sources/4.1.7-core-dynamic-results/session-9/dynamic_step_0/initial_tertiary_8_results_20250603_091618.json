We analyse stability of observability estimates for solutions to wave and Scro\u00a8dinger equations\nsubjected to additive perturbations. The paper generalises the recent averaged observability/control result\nby allowing for systems consisting of operators of different types. The method also applies to the simultaneous\nobservability problem by which one tries to estimate the energy of each component of a system under\nconsideration. The analysis relies on microlocal defect tools; in particular on standard H-measures, when\nthe main dynamic of the system is governed by the wave operator, while parabolic H-measures are explored\nin the case of the Schro\u00a8dinger operator.\n1. Introduction\nA notion of averaged control has been recently introduced in [15, 10], both for parameter dependent\nODEs, as well as for systems of PDEs with variable coefficients. Its goal is to control the average (or more\ngenerally a suitable linear combination) of system components by a single control. The problem is relevant\nin practice where the control has to be chosen independently of the coefficient value.\nThe notion is equivalent to the averaged observability, by which the energy of the system is recorded by\nobserving the average of solutions on a suitable subdomain.\nIn the paper we investigate a more general problem based on a system whose first component represents\nits main dynamic, while the other ones correspond to perturbations. Assuming that the main component is\nobservable, we explore conditions by which that property remains stable under additive perturbations.\nIn general, the operators entering the system are not assumed to be of the same type. In a special case\nof a system consisting of a same type operators, the result corresponds to the averaged control of the system,\nthus incorporating results obtained in [10].\nThe methods are applied to the simultaneous observability problem as well, by which one tries to estimate\nenergy of all system components by observing their average. The corresponds dual problem consists of\ncontrolling each individual component of the adjoint system by means of a same control.\nThe study of the problem explores microlocal analysis tools, in particular H-measures and their variants.\nH-measures, introduced independently in [7, 14], are kind of defect tools, measuring deflection of the weak\nfrom strong convergence of L2 sequences. Since their introduction, they have been successfully applied\nin many mathematical fields - let us just mention generalisation of compensated compactness results to\nequations with variable coefficients [7, 14] and applications in the control theory [4, 5, 10]. Most of these\napplications apply the so called localisation principle providing constraints on the support of H-measures\n(e.g. [14]), and the proofs of this paper rely on it as well.\nThe paper is organised as follows. In the next section we provide an averaged observability result for a\nsystem whose main dynamic is governed by the wave operator. The finite system is analysed first, followed\nby generalisations to an infinite discrete setting. Application of the approach to simultaneous observability\nis provided in the subsection 2.3. The third section is devoted to observation of the Schro\u00a8dinger equation\nunder perturbations determined either by a hyperbolic or by a parabolic type operator. In the latter case,\nparabolic H-measures (generalisation of original ones to a parabolic setting) have to be explored. The paper\nis closed with concluding remarks, and by pointing toward some open and related problems.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 93B05, 93B07, 93C20, 93D09 .\nKey words and phrases. averaged control, robust observability, parabolic H-measures.\n1\n2 MARTIN LAZAR\n2. Observation of the wave equation under uncertain perturbations\n2.1. Averaged observability. We analyse the problem of recovering the energy of the wave equation by\nobserving an additive perturbation of the solution. The perturbation is determined by a differential operator\nP2, in general different from the wave one.\nMore precisely, we consider the following system of equations:\nP1u1 = \u2202ttu1 \u2212 div (A1(t,x)\u2207u1) = 0, (t,x) \u2208 R+ \u00d7 \u2126\nP2u2 = 0, (t,x) \u2208 R+ \u00d7 \u2126\nu1 = 0, (t,x) \u2208 R+ \u00d7 \u2202\u2126\nu1(0, \u00b7) = \u03b20 \u2208 L2(\u2126)\n\u2202tu1(0, \u00b7) = \u03b21 \u2208 H\u22121(\u2126) ,\n(2.1)\nwhere \u2126 is an open, bounded set in Rd, A1 is a bounded, positive definite matrix field, while P2 is some,\nalmost arbitrary, differential operator (precise conditions on it will be given below). In the sequel we shall\nalso use the notation A1 = \u2212div (A1\u2207) for the elliptic part of P1.\nFor the moment, we specify neither initial nor boundary conditions for the second equation, we just\nassume that corresponding problem is well posed and that it admits an L2 solution. For the coefficients of\nboth the operators we assume that are merely bounded and continuous.\nProposition 2.1. Suppose that there is a constant C\u02dc, time T and an open subdomain \u03c9 such that for any\nchoice of initial conditions \u03b20, \u03b21 the solution u1 of (2.1) satisfies\nE1(0) := \u2016\u03b20\u20162L2 + \u2016\u03b21\u20162H\u22121 \u2264 C\u02dc\n\u222b T\n0\n\u222b\n\u03c9\n|u1|2dxdt . (2.2)\nIn addition, we assume that characteristic sets {pi(t,x, \u03c4, \u03be) = 0}, i = 1, 2 have no intersection for (t,x) \u2208\n\u30080, T \u3009 \u00d7 \u03c9, (\u03c4, \u03be) \u2208 Sd, where pi stands for the principal symbol of the operator Pi.\nThen for any \u03b81, \u03b82 \u2208 R, \u03b81 6= 0 there exists a constant C\u02dc\u03b81 such that the observability inequality\nE1(0) \u2264 C\u02dc\u03b81\n(\u222b T\n0\n\u222b\n\u03c9\n|\u03b81u1 + \u03b82u2|2dxdt+ \u2016\u03b20\u20162H\u22121 + \u2016\u03b21\u20162H\u22122\n)\n(2.3)\nholds for any pair of solutions (u1, u2) to (2.1).\nProof: Of course, the case \u03b82 = 0 holds trivially, and for simplicity is excluded from the further analysis.\nWe argue by contradiction. Assuming the contrary, there exists a sequence of solutions un1 , u\nn\n2 such that\nEn1 (0) > n\n(\u222b T\n0\n\u222b\n\u03c9\n|\u03b81un1 + \u03b82un2 |2dxdt + \u2016\u03b2n0 \u20162H\u22121 + \u2016\u03b2n1 \u20162H\u22122\n)\n. (2.4)\nAs the considered problem is linear, without loosing generality we can assume that En(0) = 1. Thus (2.4)\nimplies that \u2016\u03b2n0 \u20162H\u22121 + \u2016\u03b2n1 \u20162H\u22122 \u2192 0, resulting in the weak convergence (\u03b2n0 , \u03b2n1 ) \u2212\u21c0 (0, 0) in L2(\u2126) \u00d7\nH\u22121(\u2126). Therefore the solutions (un1 ) converge weakly to zero in L\n2(\u2126\u00d7 \u30080, T \u3009) as well. In order to obtain\na contradiction, we have to show that the last convergence is strong, at least on the observability region.\nFrom the contradictory assumption (2.4) we have that the H-measure \u03bd associated to a subsequence of\n(\u03b81u\nn\n1 + \u03b82u\nn\n2 ) vanishes on \u30080, T \u3009 \u00d7 \u03c9. Furthermore, it is of the form\n\u03bd = \u03b821\u00b51 + \u03b8\n2\n2\u00b52 + \u03b81\u03b822\u211c\u00b512,\nwhere on the right hand side the elements of the matrix measure associated to the vector subsequence of\n(un1 , u\nn\n2 ) are listed, with \u00b512 denoting the off-diagonal element. Note that (u\nn\n2 ) is bounded in L\n2(\u30080, T \u3009 \u00d7 \u03c9),\nsince that is the case for (un1 ) (by boundedness of initial data), and for the linear combination (\u03b81u\nn\n1 + \u03b82u\nn\n2 )\n(by contradictory assumption (2.4)), which enables one to associate an H-measure to it.\nAccording to the localisation property for H-measures, each \u00b5j is supported within the corresponding\ncharacteristic set {pi(t,x, \u03c4, \u03be) = 0}, i = 1, 2, which, by assumption, are disjoint on the observability region.\nOn the other hand, from the very definition of matrix H-measures it follows that off-diagonal entries are\nSTABILITY OF OBSERVATIONS OF PDE-S UNDER UNCERTAIN PERTURBATIONS 3\ndominated by the corresponding diagonal elements. More precisely, it holds that supp\u00b512 \u2286 supp\u00b51 \u2229\nsupp\u00b52, implying that \u00b512 = 0 on the observability region.\nThus we get that\n\u03bd = \u03b821\u00b51 + \u03b8\n2\n2\u00b52 = 0 on \u30080, T \u3009 \u00d7 \u03c9 .\nAs \u00b51 and \u00b52 are positive measures and \u03b81 > 0, it follows that \u00b51 vanishes on \u30080, T \u3009 \u00d7 \u03c9 as well. Thus\nwe get strong convergence of (un1 ) in L\n2(\u30080, T \u3009 \u00d7 \u03c9), which together with the assumption of the constant,\nnon-zero initial energy contradicts the observability estimate (2.2). \u0003\nRemark 1. The last result provides surprising stability of the observability estimate (2.2) under uncertain\nperturbations, up to compact reminders. Essentially, the only requirement for the perturbation is separation of\nthe characteristic sets. This implies that the wave component can be observed robustly when adding unknown\nperturbations, up to a finite number of low frequencies.\nIn the next step we would like to obtain the strong observability inequality for initial energy E1(0) by\nremoving compact terms in (2.3). To this effect, we have to specify some additional constraints on the\nproblem for the perturbation u2.\nWe take P2 to be an evolution operator of the form\nP2 = (\u2202t)\nk + c2(x)A1, k \u2208 N, (2.5)\nwhere A1 is an elliptic part of the wave operator P1, while c2 is a bounded and continuous function.\nTheorem 2.2. As above, we assume that the coefficients of the operator P1 are bounded and continuous,\nand that the corresponding solution u1 satisfies the observability inequality (2.2).\nIn addition we assume that the perturbation operator P2 is of the form (2.5). In the case k = 2 (i.e. P2\nbeing a wave operator) the separation of coefficients c2(x) \u2212 1 6= 0 is supposed on \u03c9.\nFor the initial values of solutions ui, i = 1, 2 we supposed these are related by a linear operator such that\nwhenever ((\u03b81u1(0) + \u03b82u2(0))|\u03c9 = 0) then\n(\nu1(0)|\u03c9 = u2(0)||\u03c9 = 0\n)\n, and the analogous implication holds for\nthe initial first order time derivatives.\nThen there is a positive constant C\u03b81 such that the strong observability inequality holds:\nE1(0) \u2264 C\u03b81\n\u222b T\n0\n\u222b\n\u03c9\n|\u03b81u1 + \u03b82u2|2dxdt . (2.6)\nRemark 2. Note that the above assumptions directly imply that characteristic sets of P1 and P2 are disjoint.\nIndeed, for P2 being an evolution operator of order k 6= 2, its principal symbol equals 0 only in poles \u03be = 0\n(case k = 1), or on the equator \u03c4 = 0 (case k > 2) of the unit sphere in the dual space, where p1 =\n\u03c42 \u2212A1(x)\u03be2 differs from zero.\nIn the case k = 2 separation of the characteristic sets is provided by the assumption c2(x) 6= 1 on \u03c9.\nProof: As in the proof of Proposition 2.1, let us suppose the contrary. Then there exists a sequence of\nsolutions un1 , u\nn\n2 to (2.1) such that E\nn\n1 (0) = 1 and\u222b T\n0\n\u222b\n\u03c9\n|\u03b81un1 + \u03b82un2 |2dxdt \u2212\u2192 0 . (2.7)\nThus the corresponding weak limits satisfy both the equation Piui = 0, as well as the relation\n\u03b81u1 + \u03b82u2 = 0 (2.8)\non the observability region. As functions ui, \u2202tui are continuous with respect to time, the bounds on initial\ndata imply \u03b20 = \u03b21 = 0 on \u03c9.\nAssumptions on the operators Pi, i = 1, 2 ensure that corresponding characteristic sets do not intersect.\nBy applying localisation property of H-measures as in the proof of Proposition 2.1 we get that un1 converges\nto u1 strongly on \u30080, T \u3009 \u00d7 \u03c9.\nIt remains to show that the limit u1 vanishes on the observability region, which, together with the\nassumption of the constant non-zero initial energy, will contradict the observability assumption (2.2).\nWe split the rest of the proof into several cases.\n4 MARTIN LAZAR\na) (k = 2) Due to the relation (2.8) it follows that\n(c2 \u2212 1)\u2202ttu1 = 0, (t,x) \u2208 \u30080, T \u3009 \u00d7 \u03c9 .\nAs |c2 \u2212 1| > 0, and the initial data are 0 on \u03c9, it implies u1 = 0 on the observability region.\nb) (k = 1) Relation (2.8) implies\n\u2202tu1 = c2(x)\u2202ttu1,\nwhich together with u1(0, \u00b7) = \u2202tu1(0, \u00b7) = 0 on \u03c9 provides the claim.\nc) (k > 2) Similar as above we obtain\n\u2202k\u22122t (\u2202ttu1) = c2(x)\u2202ttu1 .\nAs \u2202ttu1(0, \u00b7) = \u2212A1u1(0, \u00b7) = 0 on \u03c9, and similarly for the higher order derivatives, the claim\nfollows.\n\u0003\nRemark 3. Several remarks are in order.\n\u2022 The observability assumption (2.2) on a solution of the wave equation is equivalent to the Geometric\nControl Condition (GCC, [3]), stating that projection of each bicharacteristic ray on a physical space\nhas to enter the observability region in a finite time.\n\u2022 The last theorem also holds if, instead of initial data of two components being linked by an operator,\nwe assume a cone condition \u2016u2(0)\u2016L2(\u03c9) \u2264 c\u2016u1(0)\u2016L2(\u03c9)\n(\n\u2016u2(0)\u2016L2(\u03c9) \u2265 c\u2016u1(0)\u2016L2(\u03c9)\n)\n, with a\nconstant c < \u03b81/\u03b82 (c > \u03b81/\u03b82). The latter condition is stable under passing to a limit, and also\nensures the implication ((\u03b81u1(0) + \u03b82u2(0))|\u03c9 = 0) =\u21d2\n(\nu1(0)|\u03c9 = u2(0)||\u03c9 = 0\n)\n, which suffices for\nthe proof.\n\u2022 The result (2.6) can be generalise to a more general perturbation operator P2 by assuming that\ncoefficients of both the operators are analytic. In that case the separation of characteristic sets\nimplies the separation of corresponding analytic wave front sets ([9, Theorem 9.5.1]). Together with\n(2.8) it provides that u1 is analytic on the observability region. Constraints on initial data and finite\nvelocity of propagation imply u1 = 0 on an open set near t = 0, and as the solution is analytic it\nvanishes on the whole observability region which contradicts the observability assumption (2.2).\n\u2022 If P2 is a wave operator the strong observability inequality (2.6) is equivalent to the controllability of\na suitable linear combination (determined by the operator linking the initial data) of solutions to the\nadjoint system under a single control (cf. [10]).\nMeanwhile, the weak observability result (2.3) in that case corresponds to the average controllability\nof the adjoint system up to a finite number of low frequencies.\n\u2022 The last theorem generalises the results of [10] by allowing for a general evolution operator P2 which\ndoes not have to be the wave one.\nIn addition, it allows for an arbitrary linear combination of system components, while in [10]\njust their (weighted) average is explored. Specially, if the difference u1 \u2212 u2 is considered, the result\ncorresponds to the synchronisation problem (e.g. [12]) in which all the components are driven to the\nsame state by applying the null controllability of their differences.\nFurthermore, unlike in [10], the proof of the relaxed observability inequality (2.3) does not rely on\nthe propagation property of H-measures, which allows for system\u2019s coefficients to be merely continu-\nous. On the other hand, such approach avoid technical issues related to the reflection of H-measures\non the domain boundary.\n\u2022 The theorem to some extent also generalises the results of [16] in which a similar result is provided\nfor the system (2.1) consisting of a wave and a heat operator with constant coefficients (or more\ngenerally with a common elliptic part).\nHowever, although allowing for a more general perturbation operator, it requires initial data of\ntwo components of the system (2.1) to be related, while in [16] no assumptions on initial data for the\nsecond component is assumed.\n\u2022 The constant C\u03b81 can be taken to be uniform for \u03b81 \u2265 \u03b8\u2217 and \u03b8\u2217 > 0.\nSTABILITY OF OBSERVATIONS OF PDE-S UNDER UNCERTAIN PERTURBATIONS 5\n\u2022 The weak observability result (2.3) is easily generalised to a system with a finite number of compo-\nnents, under assumption that the characteristic set of the leading operator P1 is separated from the\ncharacteristic sets of all the other operators, while the latter ones can be arbitrary related.\nHowever, the generalisation of the result to an infinite dimensional setting is not straightforward.\nIt requires study of the localisation property for H-measures determined by a sequence of function\nseries, and is the subject of the next subsection.\nOn the other side, the generalisation of the strong estimate result (2.6) to a system consisting of\nmore than two components has still not been obtained, and is a subject of the current investigations.\n\u2022 The result (2.3) also holds if the observability region is not of a cylindrical type, but a more general\nset satisfying the GCC for the first component of the system. Such generalisation corresponds to a\nmoving control (cf. [11]). However, possible derivation of the corresponding stronger observability\nresult remains open, due to the last part of the proof of Theorem 2.2, in which the special (cylindrical)\nshape of the observability region is used.\n\u2022 Note that the observability result (2.6) is weaker than the one required in the simultaneous control,\nwhere one has to estimate initial energy of all components entering the system. Of course, the\nassumptions in the latter case are stronger, as one has to assume that the observability set satisfies\nthe GCC for the second component as well.\n2.2. Infinite discrete setting. In this subsection we want to analyse the stability of the observability esti-\nmates for the wave equation when the perturbation is given as a superposition of infinitely many components,\neach determined by a differential operator Pi, which, in general, does not have to be the wave one. Thus the\nsystem of interest reads as:\nP1u1 = \u2202ttu1 \u2212 div (A1(t,x)\u2207u1) = 0, (t,x) \u2208 R+ \u00d7 \u2126\nPiui = 0, (t,x) \u2208 R+ \u00d7 \u2126, i \u2265 2\nu1 = 0, (t,x) \u2208 R+ \u00d7 \u2202\u2126\nu1(0, \u00b7) = \u03b20 \u2208 L2(\u2126)\n\u2202tu1(0, \u00b7) = \u03b21 \u2208 H\u22121(\u2126) ,\n(2.9)\nwith the same assumptions on the domain \u2126 and the operator P1 being assumed for the system (2.1). For\nthe other equations, neither initial nor boundary conditions are specified. For the moment, we just assume\nthe corresponding coefficients are bounded and continuous, and the problems are well defined with solutions\nin L2(\u2126).\nIn this setting, the same microlocal analysis tool as in the finite case, in particular the localisation\nproperty of H-measures, is applied in the study of the stability of the observability estimates. However, as\nperturbations are determined by a superposition of infinitely many solutions, this requires analysis of the\nmentioned property for a sequence of function series.\nNamely, it is well known that an H-measure associated to a linear combination of two sequences is\nsupported within the union of supports of measures determined by each component, and the same property\nholds for any finite linear combination. However, in general it fails when considering superposition of infinite\nmany sequences, as shown by the next example.\nExample 1. Let (un) and (fn) be L2(Rd) sequences, whose corresponding H-measures \u00b5u and \u00b5f have\ndisjoint supports, and let (\u03b8i) be a sequence of nonnegative numbers summing in 1.\nDefine the following sequences\nvni =\n{\n\u03b8iu\nn i 6= n\nf i i = n .\nThus for each i an H-measure \u03bdi associated to v\nn\ni equals \u03b8\n2\ni \u00b5u.\nOn the other side we have that\n\u2211\ni v\nn\ni = (1\u2212 \u03b8n)un+ fn, and the corresponding measure equals \u00b5u+\u00b5f .\nThus in order to constrain support of an H-measure by supports of corresponding components we have\nto impose additional assumptions on constituting sequences. More precisely, the following result holds.\n6 MARTIN LAZAR\nLemma 2.3. Let (\u03b8i) be an averaging sequence of positive numbers summing to 1, and let (u\nn\ni )n, i \u2208 N be\na family of uniformly bounded L2 sequences, i.e. we assume there exists a constant Cu such that \u2016uni \u2016L2 \u2264\nCu, i, n \u2208 N.\nDefine the linear combination vn =\n\u2211\ni \u03b8iu\nn\ni , and denote by \u00b5i and \u03bd H-measures associated to (sub)se-\nquences (of) (uni )n and (vn), respectively.

The last sum is a remainder of a convergent series, and the\nabove limit converges to zero uniformly with respect to n.\nSimilarly, one shows the same property holds for limn\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u222b\nRd\nP\n(\u2211\u221e\n1 \u03b8\nn\ni u\nn\ni\n)\n(x)\n(\u2211\u221e\nl \u03b8\nn\nj u\nn\nj\n)\n(x)dx\n\u2223\u2223\u2223.

Suppose the observability inequality (2.2) holds for a solution u1 to (2.9).\nAs for the system (2.9), suppose that L2 norm of all the solutions ui is dominated (up to a multi-\nplicative constant, independent of a choice of initial data) by the energy norm of u1. In addition as-\nsume that characteristic set {p1(t,x, \u03c4, \u03be) = 0} has no intersection with Cl\n(\n\u222ai\u22652 {pi(t,x, \u03c4, \u03be) = 0}\n)\nfor\n(t,x) \u2208 \u30080, T \u3009 \u00d7 \u03c9, (\u03c4, \u03be) \u2208 Sd, where pi stands for the principal symbol of the operator Pi.\nThen for any averaging sequence (\u03b8i) of positive numbers summing to 1, with \u03b81 > 0, there exists a\nconstant C\u02dc\u03b8 such that the observability inequality\nE1(0) \u2264 C\u02dc\u03b8\n(\u222b T\n0\n\u222b\n\u03c9\n|\n\u2211\n\u03b8iui|2dxdt + \u2016\u03b20\u20162H\u22121 + \u2016\u03b21\u20162H\u22122\n)\n(2.14)\nholds for any family of solutions (ui) to (2.9).\nSTABILITY OF OBSERVATIONS OF PDE-S UNDER UNCERTAIN PERTURBATIONS 7\nProof: Assume the contrary. Then there exist sequences of initial conditions (\u03b2n0 ), (\u03b2\nn\n1 ), and of associ-\nated solutions (uni ), such that\n1 = En1 (0) := \u2016\u03b2n0 \u20162L2 + \u2016\u03b2n1 \u20162H\u22121 > n\n(\u222b T\n0\n\u222b\n\u03c9\n|\n\u221e\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b8iu\nn\ni |2dxdt + \u2016\u03b2n0 \u20162H\u22121 + \u2016\u03b2n1 \u20162H\u22122\n)\n. (2.15)\nLet \u03bd be an H-measure associated to a (sub)sequence of\n\u2211\u221e\ni=1 \u03b8\nn\ni u\nn\ni . Due to the inequality (2.15), it equals\nzero on \u30080, T \u3009 \u00d7 \u03c9.\nWe split the last sum into two parts \u03b81u\nn\n1 +\n\u2211\u221e\ni=2 \u03b8iu\nn\ni , and we rewrite \u03bd in the form\n\u03bd = \u03bd1 + \u03bd2 + 2\u211c\u03bd12,\nwhere \u03bd1 and \u03bd2 are H-measures associated to (sub)sequences (of) (\u03b8\nn\n1 u\nn\n1 ) and (\n\u2211\u221e\n2 \u03b8\nn\ni u\nn\ni ), respectively, while\n\u03bd12 is a measure corresponding to their product. In addition, \u03bd1 = \u03b8\n2\n1\u00b51, where by \u00b5i we denote a measure\nassociated to a (sub)sequence (of) the i\u2212th component uni .\nFrom here the statement of the theorem is obtained easily (following the lines of the proof in finite\ndiscrete case, Proposition 2.1), once we show that \u03bd1 and \u03bd2 have disjoint supports.\nBy the localisation property for H-measures, each measure \u00b5i is supported within the set {pi(t,x, \u03c4, \u03be) =\n0}.\nThe assumption on the domination of solutions to (2.9) by an energy norm of u1, together with the\nconstant initial energy En1 (0) implies uniform bound on solutions u\nn\ni , both with respect to i and n. Thus we\ncan apply Lemma 2.3 to conclude that \u03bd2 is supported within the set\nCl\n(\n\u222ai\u22652 {pi(t,x, \u03c4, \u03be) = 0}\n)\n,\nwhich, due to the assumption on separation of the characteristics set, does not intersect the support of\n\u03bd1 = \u03b8\n2\n1\u00b51. As \u03b81 is strictly positive, we get that u\nn\n1 converges to 0 strongly in L\n2(\u30080, T \u3009 \u00d7 \u03c9), which\ncontradicts the observability estimate (2.2). \u0003\nRemark 4.\n\u2022 The assumption of the last proposition requiring solutions ui of (2.9) to be dominated by the energy\nnorm of u1 occurs, for example, in a case of a system consisting of the operators of the same form,\nPi = \u03c4\n2 \u2212Ai(t,x)\u03be \u00b7 \u03be, with uniformly bounded (both from below and above) coefficients and initial\nenergies.\nThe assumption on separation of characteristics sets in that case can be stated as\nA1(t,x)\u03be \u00b7 \u03be > (<) sup\ni\u22652\n(inf\ni\u22652\n) Ai(t,x)\u03be \u00b7 \u03be, (t,x) \u2208 \u30080, T \u3009 \u00d7 \u03c9, \u03be 6= 0 ,\ni.e. the fastest (or the slowest) velocity is strictly separated from all the others.\nIn that case the weak observability (2.14) result is equivalent to the averaged controllability of the\nadjoint system up to a finite number of low frequencies.\nOf course, one can construct more general systems, including operators of different types as well,\nthat satisfy the required boundedness assumption.\n\u2022 As already mentioned in previous subsection, obtaining corresponding strong observability result in\nthis setting remains an open problem.\n\u2022 The constant C\u03b8 appearing in (2.14) can be taken uniformly for a family of averaging sequences, each\nsatisfying\n(i) \u03b81 \u2265 \u03b8\u2217,\n(ii)\n\u2211\u221e\nk \u03b8i \u2264 \u01ebk,\nwhere \u03b8\u2217 \u2208 \u30080, 1] and (\u03b5k) is a null sequence, both independent of a choice of a particular sequence\n(\u03b8i).\n2.3. Simultaneous observability. The subsection deals with a problem of recovering energy of a system\nby observing an average of solutions on a suitable subdomain. For this purpose one has to estimate initial\nenergies of all system components, unlike the case of the average observability where this was required just\nfor the first one. A two component system is analysed firstly, while generalisations to a more dimensional\ncase is discussed at the end.\n8 MARTIN LAZAR\nWe reconsider the system (2.1) assuming that P2 is an evolution operator of the form\nP2 = (\u2202t)\nk +A2, k \u2208 N, (2.16)\nwhere A2 is an (uniformly) elliptic operator (in general different from A1), and the problem for the pertur-\nbation u2 is accompanied by a series of initial conditions(\n(\u2202t)\nju2\n)\n(0) = \u03b3j \u2208 H\u2212j(\u2126), j = 0, . . . , k \u2212 1.\nIts initial energy is denoted by\nE2(0) =\nk\u22121\u2211\n0\n\u2016\u03b3j\u2016H\u2212j(\u2126) .\nAs in the previous subsection, we start with a weak observability result.\nProposition 2.5. Suppose that there is a constant C\u02dc, time T and an open subdomain \u03c9 such that for any\nchoice of initial conditions the solutions to (2.1) satisfy\nEi(0) \u2264 C\u02dc\n\u222b T\n0\n\u222b\n\u03c9\n|ui|2dxdt, i = 1, 2 . (2.17)\nIn addition assume that characteristic sets {pi(t,x, \u03c4, \u03be) = 0}, i = 1, 2 have no intersection for (t,x) \u2208\n\u30080, T \u3009 \u00d7 \u03c9, (\u03c4, \u03be) \u2208 Sd, where pi stands for the principal symbol of the operator Pi.\nThen for any \u03b81, \u03b82 \u2208 R \\ {0} there exists a constant C\u02dc\u03b8 such that the observability inequality\nE1(0)+E2(0) \u2264 C\u02dc\u03b8\n(\u222b T\n0\n\u222b\n\u03c9\n|\u03b81u1 + \u03b82u2|2dxdt+ \u2016\u03b20\u20162H\u22121 + \u2016\u03b21\u20162H\u22122 + \u2016\u03b30\u20162H\u22121 + . . .+ \u2016\u03b3k\u22121\u20162H\u2212k\n)\n(2.18)\nholds for any pair of solutions (u1, u2) to (2.1).\nThe result is obtained easily by following the steps of the proof presented above in the averaged ob-\nservability setting. Assuming the contrary and implying microlocal analysis tools, one shows that both\ncomponents uni converge to 0 strongly on the observability region, thus obtaining the contradiction.\nHowever, a different approach is required in order to obtain the strong observability inequality for initial\nenergy by removing compact terms in (2.18). It is based on a standard compactness-uniqueness procedure\nof reducing the observability for low frequencies to an elliptic unique continuation result [3, 5].\nWe introduce a subspace N(T ) of H = L2(\u2126) \u00d7 H\u22121(\u2126) \u00d7 L2(\u2126) \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 H1\u2212k(\u2126), consisting of initial\ndata for which the average of solutions to (2.1) vanishes on the observability region\nN(T ) := {(\u03b20, \u03b21, \u03b30, . . . , \u03b31\u2212k) \u2208 H | \u03b81u1 + \u03b82u2 = 0 on \u30080, T \u3009 \u00d7 \u03c9}.\nBased on the relaxed observability inequality (2.18) it follows that N(T ) is a finite dimensional space.\nFurthermore, the following characterisation holds.\nLemma 2.6. We assume one of the following statements holds:\na) The order k of time derivative in (2.16) is odd. Coefficients of both the operators P1 and P2 are time\nindependent and of class C1,1,\nb) The time derivative order k is even, and Ak/21 \u2212 A2 (or \u2212(Ak/21 \u2212 A2)) is an uniformly elliptic\noperator. Coefficients of both the operators P1 and P2 are analytic.\nThen N(T ) = {0}.\nProof: One first shows that N(T ) is an A-invariant, where A is an unbounded operator on H :\nA =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n0 \u22121\nA1 0 0\n0\n0 \u2212Ik\u22121\nA2 0\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 , (2.19)\nwith the domain D(A) = H10(\u2126)\u00d7 L2(\u2126)\u00d7 H10(\u2126)\u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7H2\u2212k(\u2126).\nSTABILITY OF OBSERVATIONS OF PDE-S UNDER UNCERTAIN PERTURBATIONS 9\nBeing A-invariant and finite-dimensional, it contains an eigenfunction of A. Thus there is a \u03bb \u2208 C and\n(\u03b20, \u03b21, \u03b30, . . . , \u03b31\u2212k) \u2208 N(T ) such that\nA1\u03b20 = \u2212\u03bb2\u03b20\nA2\u03b30 = (\u22121)k\u22121\u03bbk\u03b30\n\u03b21 = \u2212\u03bb\u03b20\n\u03b3j = (\u22121)j\u03bbj\u03b30, j = 1, . . . , k \u2212 1 .\n(2.20)\nBy the definition of N(T ) it follows \u03b81u1 + \u03b82u2 = 0 on \u30080, T \u3009 \u00d7 \u03c9, and specially\n\u03b81\u03b20 + \u03b82\u03b30 = 0 on \u03c9 . (2.21)\nAt this level, we want to show that each assumption of the lemma implies \u03b20 = \u03b30 = 0.\na) As Ai, i = 1, 2 are positive operators and k is odd, from (2.20) it follows that one of functions \u03b20, \u03b30 is\ntrivial. By relation (2.21) it follows that the other one also equals zero on \u03c9. Being an eigenfunction\nof an elliptic operator, the unique continuation argument (e.g. [8, Theorem 3]) implies it is zero\neverywhere.\nb) Analyticity of coefficients implies analyticity of eigenfunctions. Specially it follows \u03b81\u03b20 + \u03b82\u03b30 = 0\neverywhere, and relations (2.20) imply\n(Ak/21 \u2212A2)\u03b20 = 0.\nAssumptions on the operator Ak/21 \u2212A2 imply \u03b20 = 0 on \u2126.\n\u0003\nRemark 5. In a special case A2 = \u2212div (c2(x)\u2207) one easily proves that the last Lemma holds with analytic\ncoefficients c1, c2 being separated just on an arbitrary non-empty open set, and not on the entire \u2126.\nTheorem 2.7. Under the assumptions of Proposition 2.1 and Lemma 2.6 there is a positive constant C\u03b8\nsuch that the strong observability inequality holds:\nE1(0) + E2(0) \u2264 C\u03b8\n\u222b T\n0\n\u222b\n\u03c9\n|\u03b81u1 + \u03b82u2|2dxdt . (2.22)\nProof: As in the proof of Proposition 2.1, let us suppose the contrary. Then there exists a sequence of\nsolutions un1 , u\nn\n2 to (2.1) such that E\nn\n1 (0) = 1 and\u222b T\n0\n\u222b\n\u03c9\n|\u03b81un1 + \u03b82un2 |2dxdt \u2212\u2192 0 .\nThus for weak limits (u1, u2) of solutions on the observability region we have \u03b81u1 + \u03b82u2 = 0, implying(\nu1(0), \u2202tu1(0), u2(0), . . . ,\n(\n(\u2202t)\nk\u22121u2\n)\n(0)\n) \u2208 N(T ). By means of the above lemma and taking into account\nthe relaxed observability inequality, it follows\n1 \u2264 C\u02dc\u03b8\n(\u222b T\n0\n\u222b\n\u03c9\n|\u03b81un1 + \u03b82un2 |2dxdt + \u2016\u03b2n0 \u20162H\u22121 + \u2016\u03b2n1 \u20162H\u22122 + \u2016\u03b3n0 \u20162H\u22121 + . . .+ \u2016\u03b3nk\u22121\u20162H\u2212k\n)\n\u2212\u2192 0,\nthus obtaining a contradiction. \u0003\nWe close this subsection by the following remarks.\nRemark 6.\n\u2022 If P2 is a second order evolution operator the strong observability inequality (2.22) is equivalent to\nthe simultaneous controllability of the adjoint system, also studied in [10], by which one controls each\ncomponent individually (and not just their average).\n\u2022 The notion of simultaneous observability is stronger than the average one, as it estimates energy of\nall system components, whose initial data, in this case, are not related. Consequently, it requires\nstronger assumption of GCC being satisfied by each component.\n10 MARTIN LAZAR\n\u2022 The application of the compactness-uniqueness procedure in the passage from the weak to the strong\nobservability estimate allows the perturbation P2 to be an evolution operator with an arbitrary elliptic\npart. However, such approach is not possible in the averaged observability setting. Namely, in order\nfor subspace N(T ) to be finite dimensional one has to relate the initial data of two components by a\nbounded linear operator. But such constrain would not be preserved under action of the operator A\ngiven by (2.19), and as a consequence N(T ) would not be A-invariant.\n\u2022 The weak observability result (2.18) is easily generalised to a system with a finite number of compo-\nnents, under assumption that the characteristic sets of all operators are mutually disjoint.\n\u2022 As in the averaged observability case, the generalisation of strong estimate result (2.22) to a system\nconsisting of more than two components has still not been obtained, and is a subject of the current\ninvestigations.\n3. Observation of the Schro\u00a8dinger equation under uncertain perturbations\nIn this section we consider a system in which the first component, the one whose energy is observed,\nsatisfies the Schro\u00a8dinger equation, while the second one, corresponding to a perturbation, is governed by an\nevolution operator P2:\nP1u1 = i\u2202tu1 + div (A1(x)\u2207u1) = 0, (t,x) \u2208 R+ \u00d7 \u2126\nP2u2 = 0, (t,x) \u2208 R+ \u00d7 \u2126\nu1 = 0, (t,x) \u2208 R+ \u00d7 \u2202\u2126\nu1(0, \u00b7) = \u03b20 \u2208 L2(\u2126) .\n(3.1)\nAs in the study of perturbations of the wave dynamics in Section 2, we specify no initial or boundary\nconditions for the second operators, we just assume that corresponding problem is well posed and that it\nadmits an L2 solution. As for the system coefficients, as before we impose merely boundedness and continuous\nassumptions, and suppose that A1 is a positive definite matrix field.\n3.1. Averaged observability under non-parabolic perturbations. For the reasons explained below,\nin this subsection we restrict the analysis to evolution operators P2 of order strictly larger than one. In that\ncase the stability of the Schro\u00a8dinger observability estimate is given by the next theorem.\nTheorem 3.1. Suppose that there is a constant C\u02dc, time T and an open subdomain \u03c9 such that for any\nchoice of initial datum \u03b20 the solution u1 of (2.1) satisfies\nE1(0) := \u2016\u03b20\u20162L2 \u2264 C\u02dc\n\u222b T\n0\n\u222b\n\u03c9\n|u1|2dxdt . (3.2)\nIn addition, for the system (3.1) we assume the following:\na) The perturbation operator is an evolution operator of the form (2.5) and of the order k > 1.\nb) The initial values of solutions ui, i = 1, 2 are related by a linear operator such that whenever\n((\u03b81u1(0) + \u03b82u2(0))|\u03c9 = 0) then\n(\nu1(0)|\u03c9 = u2(0)||\u03c9 = 0\n)\n.\nThen, for any \u03b81 \u2208 \u30080, 1] there exists a constant C\u03b8 such that the observability inequality\nE1(0) \u2264 C\u03b8\n\u222b T\n0\n\u222b\n\u03c9\n|\u03b81u1 + \u03b82u2|2dxdt (3.3)\nholds for any pair of solutions (u1, u2) to (2.1).\nThe proof goes similarly as for the observations of the wave equation. Required conditions a), b) are\nnecessary for obtaining the strong observability inequality, without a compact term.\nOn the other hand, in order to obtain a relaxed inequality with a compact term, no assumption is\nrequired at all. Namely, the assumption on separation of characteristic sets {pi(t,x, \u03c4, \u03be) = 0} required\nin Proposition 2.1 becomes superfluous in this setting, as being directly satisfied by an arbitrary evolution\noperator P2 of order k strictly larger than 1. Namely, its characteristic set does not contain the poles \u03be = 0\nof the unit sphere in the dual space, which constitute the characteristic set of the Schro\u00a8dinger operator P1.\nSTABILITY OF OBSERVATIONS OF PDE-S UNDER UNCERTAIN PERTURBATIONS 11\nHowever, every Schro\u00a8dinger or the heat operator P2 fails to satisfy the assumption. Namely, no matter\nthe coefficients entering the equation, both have characteristic set within the poles \u03be = 0, same as P1, and\nlocalisation principle fail to distinguish corresponding H-measures. To analyse such a system one needs\na microlocal tool better adopted to a study of parabolic problems. Namely, original H-measures were\nconstructed with the aim of analysing hyperbolic problems and are not capable to distinguish differences\nbetween the time and space variables that are intrinsic to parabolic equations. Their variant, parabolic\nH-measures, was recently introduced with the purpose of overcoming the mentioned constraint.\n3.2. Parabolic H-measures. Parabolic H-measures were first introduced in [1], while more exhausted\nintroduction can be found in [2], elaborating in particular their basic properties: localisation and propagation\none. The former will be used in the next subsection for proving the stability of the observability estimate\nfor the Schro\u00a8dinger operator under parabolic perturbation.\nHere we expose the basic result on parabolic H-measures used in the note.\nThe main idea in their construction is to replace the projection along the straight rays in the dual space,\ndetermined by the term \u03be/|\u03be| in the definition of the original H-measures, by the one going along meridians\nof paraboloids \u03c4 = a\u03be2. The hypersurface on which the dual space (except the origin) is projected is a\nrotational ellipsoid\nP : . . . \u03c42 +\n\u03be2\n2\n= 1 .\nAlthough the ellipsoid might seem as an unnatural choice of the surface on which one want to construct\nthe parabolic H-measures, crucial in its choice was that the curves along which the projections are taken\nintersect it in the normal direction, as it was in the classical case, where the rays radiating from origin are\nperpendicular to the unit sphere. The mentioned normality property enables study of propagation properties\nof the measures.\nConcerning the applications, the most important is that the new tool is also a kind of defect measure,\nin the sense that null parabolic H-measure is equivalent to strong convergence of (vn) in L\n2\nloc(R\n1+d).\nIn order to formulate the localisation principle, we first introduce some special anisotropic (Sobolev)\nfunction spaces\nH\ns\n2\n, s(R1+d) :=\n{\nu \u2208 S \u2032 : kspu\u02c6 \u2208 L2(R1+d)\n}\n, s \u2208 R,\nwhere kp(\u03c4, \u03be) :=\n4\n\u221a\n1 + (2\u03c0\u03c4)2 + (2\u03c0|\u03be|)4 is the weight function. These are Hilbert spaces and they are\nparticular examples of more general Ho\u00a8rmander spaces Bp,k described in [9, \u00a710.1].\nWe also define the fractional derivative:\n\u221a\n\u2202t as a pseudodifferential operator with a polyhomogeneous\nsymbol\n\u221a\n2\u03c0i\u03c4 , i.e. \u221a\n\u2202tu = F\n(\u221a\n2\u03c0i\u03c4 u\u02c6(\u03c4)\n)\n.\nTheorem 3.2. (localisation principle for parabolic H-measures, [2]) Let (vn) be a sequence of func-\ntions uniformly compactly supported in t and converging weakly to zero in L2(R1+d;Cr), and let for s \u2208 N\u221a\n\u2202t\ns\n(A0vn) +\n\u2211\n|\u03b1|=s\n\u2202\u03b1x (A\n\u03b1\nvn) \u2212\u2192 0 strongly in H\u2212\ns\n2\n,\u2212s\nloc (R\n1+d) ,\nwhere A0,A\u03b1 are continuous and bounded matrix coefficients, while \u03b1 \u2208 Nd0.\nThen for the associated parabolic H-measure \u00b5 we have(\n(\n\u221a\n2\u03c0i\u03c4)sA0 +\n\u2211\n|\u03b1|=s\n(2\u03c0i\u03be)\u03b1A\u03b1\n)\n\u00b5\u22a4 = 0.\nIn particular, the principle implies that the measure \u00b5 is supported within the parabolic characteristic\nset:\ndet\n(\n(\n\u221a\n2\u03c0i\u03c4)sA0 +\n\u2211\n|\u03b1|=s\n(2\u03c0i\u03be)\u03b1A\u03b1\n)\n= 0, (\u03c4, \u03be) \u2208 P\n12 MARTIN LAZAR\nExample 2. (Application of the localisation principle to various equations)\nIn all the examples we assume that the equation coefficients satisfy the assumptions of the preceding\ntheorem, i.e are continuous and bounded.\n\u2022 The Schro\u00a8dinger equation\nLet (un) be a sequence of solutions to the Schro\u00a8dinger equation\ni\u2202tun + div (A(t,x)\u2207un) = 0.\nIf (un) is bounded in L\n2(R+ \u00d7Rd) then the associated parabolic H-measure \u00b5 satisfies\n(2\u03c0\u03c4 + 4\u03c02A(t,x)\u03be \u00b7 \u03be)\u00b5 = 0,\nimplying \u00b5 is supported in points of the form 2\u03c0\u03c4 = \u22124\u03c02A(t,x)\u03be \u00b7 \u03be.\n\u2022 The heat equation\nLet (un) be a sequence of solutions to the heat equation\n\u2202tun \u2212 div (A(t,x)\u2207un) = 0\nwhere A is a bounded, positive definite matrix field. If (un) is bounded in L\n2(R+ \u00d7Rd) then the\nassociated parabolic H-measure \u00b5 satisfies\n(2\u03c0i\u03c4 + 4\u03c02A(t,x)\u03be \u00b7 \u03be)\u00b5 = 0.\nAs (parabolic) H-measures live on a hypersurface in the dual space excluding the origin, and A is\npositive definite, the term in the braces above never equals zero, implying \u00b5 is a trivial (null) measure.\n\u2022 The wave equation\nLet (un) be a sequence of solutions to the wave equation\n\u2202ttun \u2212 div (A(t,x)\u2207un) = 0.\nIf (un) is bounded in L\n2(R+ \u00d7Rd) then the associated parabolic H-measure \u00b5 satisfies\n4\u03c02\u03c42\u00b5 = 0,\nimplying \u00b5 is supported in the equator \u03c4 = 0 of the hypersurface P.\nFrom the given examples it is clear that by taking two Schro\u00a8dinger operators with separated coefficients\nwe shall be able to distinguish corresponding parabolic H-measures. Of course, the distinction is also possible\nif the considered operators are of different type (e.g. the Schro\u00a8dinger and the wave one), as it was the case with\nthe original H-measures. This enables the generalisation of Theorem 3.1 represented in the next subsection.\n3.3. Averaged observability under parabolic perturbations. We reconsider the system (3.1) with the\naim of obtaining the stability of the observability estimate for the Schro\u00a8dinger operator under perturbation\ndetermined by the operator P2 under minimal conditions on the latter. In particular, we want allow it to be\nthe Schro\u00a8dinger, or some other parabolic type operator, like P1.\nThe results of previous subsection, in particular the localisation property (Theorem 3.2) provide the\nfollowing result.\nTheorem 3.3. In addition to assumptions of Theorem 3.1 we allow P2 to be an evolution operator of order\none, and assume the separation of coefficients c2(x) 6= \u2212i holds on \u03c9 in the case k = 1.\nThen for any \u03b81 \u2208 \u30080, 1] there exists a constant C\u03b8 such that the strong observability inequality\nE1(0) \u2264 C\u03b8\n\u222b T\n0\n\u222b\n\u03c9\n|\u03b81u1 + \u03b82u2|2dxdt (3.4)\nholds for any pair of solutions (u1, u2) to (3.1).\nThe proof goes along the same lines as the one of the Theorem 2.2, using that the parabolic H-measures\nshare the basic properties (positive definiteness, diagonal domination) with their original (hyperbolic) coun-\nterparts. Crucial in the proof is separation of corresponding parabolic characteristic sets. For an evolu-\ntion operator P2 of order k \u2265 2 that set is restricted to the equator \u03c4 = 0 of the hypersurface P, where\np1 = 2\u03c0\u03c4 + 4\u03c0\n2A(t,x)\u03be \u00b7 \u03be differs from zero (cf. Example 2). For k = 1 the separation follows by the\nassumption c2(x) 6= \u2212i.\nSTABILITY OF OBSERVATIONS OF PDE-S UNDER UNCERTAIN PERTURBATIONS 13\nThe novelty obtained by the application of parabolic measures is that both the operators entering the\nsystem (3.1) are allowed to be of the same type (e.g. two Schro\u00a8dinger operators with coefficients being\nseparated on the observability region \u30080, T \u3009 \u00d7 \u03c9). In that case the observability estimate (3.4) is equivalent\nto the averaged control of the adjoint system.\nOf course, operators of different types are admissible as well, thus the last theorem incorporates the\nresults of Subsection 3.1 as well.\nFinally, let us mention that as in Section 2 one can obtain analogous result for the robust observability\nof the Schro\u00a8dinger equation in the simultaneous and infinite discrete setting.\n4. Conclusion\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the above results refers to a system determined by two operators\nof a same type - either the Schro\u00a8dinger or the wave one. The weak observability estimates in that case\ncorrespond to the average control of solutions to adjoint system up to a finite number of low frequencies. The\nrequired assumptions are optimised: the coefficients are merely continuous and separated on the observability\nregion. The strong averaged observability result, corresponding to the exact averaged controllability, assumes\nin addition initial data of two components to be related in an appropriate manner. Its proof, unlike in\n[10], employs neither propagation property of H-measures nor unique continuation procedure, therefore not\nrequiring additional smoothness assumptions.\nThe paper restricts to decoupled systems, but one could analyse more general ones with coupling in\nlower order terms (e.g. [12]). Such terms do not effect microlocal properties of solutions, thus enabling a\ngeneralisation of the obtained estimates.\nSurely of interest would be a generalisation of the results to a parameter dependent system with a para-\nmeter ranging over a continuous set. A problem has been analysed in [13], exploring the heat and Schro\u00a8dinger\nequations with a randomly distributed parameter. The constant coefficients operators are considered, with\neigenfunctions of corresponding elliptic parts being independent of the parameter value. Thus the explored\naverages are presented as a solution (or a superposition of two solutions) to a similar evolution problem(s),\nwhich is crucial in the proof.\nAs the next step in that direction, one would consider a system of equations determined by evolution\noperators whose elliptic parts coincide up to a scalar function:\nP (\u03bd) = \u2202kt + c(x, \u03bd)A ,\nwith \u03bd being a parameter, and A the elliptic part of P . The variable dependence of the coefficient c would\nrequire another techniques from those applied in [13]. In this paper we have obtained a corresponding result\nfor a parameter ranging over an infinite discrete set, but only at the level of a weak observability estimate\nwith compact terms.\nBy using transmutation techniques developed in [6], the simultaneous observability result of subsection\n2.3 can be employed in order to obtain controllability and observability properties for a system of heat\nequations (cf. [10]). Similar transmutation procedure can be constructed, transferring Schro\u00a8dinger into wave\ntype problems, and vice versa. Its application will result in observability estimates for a system of Schro\u00a8dinger\nequations, derived from the corresponding results for the wave ones. It would be interesting to compare such\nobtained results with those obtained directly in Section 3 by means of parabolic H-measures, and to compare\nthe efficiency of methods applied by each approach.\nAcknowledgements\nThe paper is supported in part by Croatian Science Foundation under the project 9780.
