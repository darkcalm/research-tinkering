This 18 \ndichotomisation into fertile versus infertile, based on lack of conception over 12 month period, is 19 \nfundamentally flawed. Time to conception is strongly influenced by factors such as female age and 20 \nwhilst a minority of couples have absolute infertility (sterility), many are able to conceive without 21 \nintervention but may take longer to do so, reflecting the degree of subfertility. This natural 22 \nvariability in time to conception means that subfertility reflects a prognosis rather than a diagnosis. 23 \nCurrent clinical prediction models in fertility only provide individualised estimates of the probability 24 \nof either treatment independent pregnancy or treatment dependent pregnancy, but do not take 25 \naccount of both.  Together, prognostic factors which are able to predict natural pregnancy and 26 \npredictive factors of response to treatment would be required to estimate the absolute increase in 27 \npregnancy chances with treatment. This stratified medicine approach would be appropriate for 28 \nfacilitating personalised decision-making concerning whether or not to treat subfertile patients.  29 \nPublished models are thus far of little value for decisions regarding when to initiate treatment in 30 \npatients who undergo a period of, ultimately unsuccessful, expectant management. We submit that 31 \na dynamic prediction approach, which estimates the change in subfertility prognosis over the course 32 \nof follow-up, would be ideally suited to inform when the commencement of treatment would be 33 \nmost beneficial in those undergoing expectant management. Further research needs to be 34 \nundertaken to identify treatment predictive factors and to identify or create databases to allow 35 \nthese approaches to be explored. In the interim, the most feasible approach is to use a combination 36 \nof previously published clinical prediction models.  37 \n \n \n3 \n \nIntroduction   38 \nInfertility is defined as \u201ca disease of the reproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a 39 \nclinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse\u201d according to 40 \nthe World Health Organisation (WHO) and International Committee for Monitoring Assisted 41 \nReproductive Technology (ICMART) (Zegers-Hochschild et al., 2009). Absence of pregnancy within 42 \nthis time-period is interpreted as evidence of sterility by many couples, who then request immediate 43 \ntreatment. 44 \nIn fact, the probability of conceiving is highly variable (te Velde et al. 2000) and genuine unresolved 45 \ninfertility or sterility, occurs in a minority (3\u20135%) of all couples (Greenhall and Vessey 1990). 41TAs 46 \ncouples who are more \u201cfertile\u201d41T tend to conceive early, the length of time couples have been 47 \nunsuccessful at conceiving reflects the degree of subfertility. The term \u201cinfertility\u201d is often used 48 \ninterchangeably with \u201csubfertility\u201d ((Gnoth et al. 2005, Gurunath et al. 2011, Habbema et al. 2004)). 49 \nHowever, in this article we define as subfertile those couples in whom routine investigations have 50 \nnot been able to identify any absolute barriers to conception such as blocked Fallopian tubes, 51 \nanovulation or azoospermia. Many of these couples are advised to undergo a period of expectant 52 \nmanagement, meaning that they continue trying to conceive naturally for a specified period of time 53 \nbefore being offered treatment. 54 \nData from non-contracepting populations (Bongaarts 1975) show that increase in the duration of 55 \nunsuccessful unprotected intercourse is associated with decreasing chances of pregnancy. However, 56 \nthe definition of infertility as a failure to conceive within a year represents an oversimplification, as 57 \nmany couples in this group will conceive beyond one year (Bongaarts 1975, Snick et al. 1997). The 58 \nonly certain way of \u2018diagnosing\u2019 absolute infertility in subfertile couples, i.e. establishing with 59 \ncertainty that a couple is sterile, is lack of conception in women at the end of reproductive life. By 60 \nthen of course it is too late to rectify the situation by medical means. Thus, in order to be a clinically 61 \nuseful entity, subfertility needs to reflect the prognosis of a couple in terms of their ability to 62 \n \n \n4 \n \nconceive unaided. Such an approach recognises the fact that apart from duration, a woman\u2019s ability 63 \nto conceive also declines with her age and depends on many other factors that vary the chances of 64 \nconception such as frequency of intercourse, semen quality and pelvic pathology (Evers 2002).  65 \nHaving acknowledged that subfertility represents a prognosis rather than an absolute diagnosis, it is 66 \nworth considering the best way of assessing the chances of pregnancy for the purposes of initiating 67 \ninvestigations and treatment. One option, which allows consideration of time on a continuous scale 68 \n(rather than dichotomously) and a couple\u2019s risk factors for conception, is to use appropriately 69 \ndeveloped and validated clinical prediction models. Many of these already exist in fertility and they 70 \neither predict the chances of pregnancy following treatment or without treatment, but not both 71 \n(Leushuis et al. 2009). However, a method of taking both groups into account to estimate the 72 \nadditional chances of pregnancy following treatment could allow clinicians to identify those who 73 \nwould benefit from it. For example, an absolute increase of 5% in the chance of pregnancy following 74 \nin vitro fertilization (IVF) compared to no treatment, might be important to a woman aged 38 whose 75 \nnatural chances of pregnancy have declined with age, but not to a woman aged 28 whose natural 76 \nchances are still relatively high. 77 \nIn this paper we describe the limitations of current clinical prediction models for subfertility and 78 \nsubsequently aim to explore the advancement of such models to address two key questions in 79 \nfertility care: firstly, how should clinicians discriminate between those who need active fertility 80 \ntreatment versus those who do not? Secondly, given that subfertility prognosis changes over time, 81 \nwhen should those on expectant management be offered active treatment? 82 \n 83 \nExisting clinical prediction models in subfertility 84 \nCritical for the management of a subfertile couple prior to initiation of treatment is knowledge of 85 \ntheir subfertility prognosis i.e. chances of spontaneous conception. As mentioned earlier, a way of 86 \n \n \n5 \n \nestimating subfertility prognosis is through clinical prediction modelling. A time-to-event statistical 87 \nmodel (such as the Cox proportional hazards model) is a good method of predicting the chances of a 88 \nbinary outcome, such as conception (versus no conception), over a period of time. Such models 89 \nadjust for prognostic factors, which are clinical or biological characteristics (such as female age and 90 \nduration of infertility) that are associated with a clinical outcome (such as spontaneous pregnancy) 91 \nin an untreated patient (Italiano 2011). Prognostic factors for subfertility can be obtained from the 92 \nmedical literature, clinical opinion or further research. Table 1 contains a list of known prognostic 93 \nfactors of spontaneous pregnancy from published models (Leushuis et al. 2009). The recently 94 \npublished Prognosis Research Strategy (PROGRESS) articles specify a framework of four interlinked 95 \nthemes for prognostic research. They recommend that large, prospective, registered prognostic 96 \nfactor studies with appropriate sample size and statistical analyses are required in order to find new 97 \nprognostic factors that can predict an outcome (Hemingway et al. 2013, Hingorani et al. 2013, Riley 98 \net al. 2013, Steyerberg et al. 2013). 99 \nA systematic review of clinical prediction models in reproductive medicine identified 29 prediction 100 \nmodels that predicted spontaneous pregnancy (n=9) or successful intrauterine insemination (IUI, 101 \nn=3) or IVF  n=17) (Leushuis et al. 2009). Of these 29 models, only eight were externally validated, 102 \nthree of which showed adequate performance (Custers et al. 2007, Hunault et al. 2004, Smeenk et 103 \nal. 2000, Steures et al. 2006, Steures et al. 2004, Templeton et al. 1996, van der Steeg et al. 2007). 104 \nAssessment of the predictive ability and external validation of a prediction model is essential if it is 105 \nto be used to facilitate clinical practice (Collins 2005, Coppus et al. 2009). Aspects to evaluate include 106 \ndiscrimination (how good a model is distinguishing between patients who do and do not become 107 \npregnant) and calibration (agreement between the probability estimate from the prediction model 108 \nand observed outcome frequencies) (Steyerberg 2009). 109 \nThe Hunault model, synthesised from three previous models based on three prospective databases 110 \nof subfertile women attending a Dutch University hospital, a Dutch general hospital and eleven 111 \n \n \n6 \n \nCanadian University Hospitals, was found to predict spontaneous pregnancy leading to live birth 112 \nreasonably well (Hunault et al. 2004). It had poor discriminatory ability, which is generally the case 113 \nwith prediction modelling in subfertile couples who tend to be rather homogeneous in terms of 114 \nclinical characteristics (Coppus et al. 2009), but calibrated well when applied to external cohorts 115 \n(Hunault et al. 2005, van der Steeg et al. 2007). 116 \nTwo other models, which showed acceptable performance in the Leushuis et al (2009) review, were 117 \nthe Steures et al (2006) model which predicts live birth following IUI, and the Templeton et al (1996) 118 \nmodel which predicts live birth following IVF. Both of these models also had poor discriminatory 119 \nability (Coppus et al. 2009, Smeenk et al. 2007). However, the Templeton model performs 120 \nreasonably well after adjusting for improved IVF success rates over time (te Velde et al. 2014). Since 121 \nthe Leushuis review, a model developed using the Human Fertilisation and Embryological Authority 122 \n(HFEA) database of all IVF treatments in the UK has been published (Nelson and Lawlor 2011) but 123 \nperformed no better than the Templeton model (te Velde et al. 2014). 124 \nA prognostic model could be used to make risk-based decisions in clinical practice. This would 125 \ninvolve calculating the absolute chance of spontaneous pregnancy occurring within a pre-specified 126 \ntime period, e.g. one year, for a given individual (see Figure 1, Model 1a). Decisions regarding 127 \nwhether or not to treat can then be made using some pre-specified clinically agreed chance cut-off. 128 \nFor example, the creators of the Hunault model considered couples with <20% chance of 129 \nspontaneous pregnancy as a poor prognosis group who should undergo immediate treatment 130 \n(Hunault et al. 2004). Those with >40% chance were labelled as having a high chance of spontaneous 131 \npregnancy and the article suggested that these couples should be encouraged to wait for another 132 \nyear. Those in the middle group of 20\u201340% chance should be advised in such a manner as to balance 133 \nthe probability of pregnancy against the risks from fertility treatment. 134 \nHowever, using probabilities from a model that predicts treatment independent pregnancy to make 135 \ntreatment decisions does not take into account the chance that treatment may not be effective in 136 \n \n \n7 \n \nparticular women. For example, being led solely by the above model cut-offs, a woman with a 15% 137 \nchance of pregnancy would undergo immediate treatment. However, depending on the woman\u2019s 138 \nspecific characteristics, her chance of pregnancy following treatment may be no greater, or, it may 139 \nbe substantially greater. Conversely, models that predict pregnancy following treatment do not tell 140 \nus whether the woman\u2019s absolute chance of pregnancy would have been any lower without 141 \ntreatment, and indeed how much lower (Figure 1, Model 1b). The best option would be to use a 142 \ncombined dataset, ideally from randomized controlled trial (RCT) data, including these two groups of 143 \nwomen in order to model the additional benefit of treatment over no treatment. This can be made 144 \npossible using a stratified medicine approach. 145 \n 146 \nAbsolute versus relative risk 147 \nBefore we consider stratified medicine it is important to define absolute and relative risk.  Absolute 148 \nrisk refers to the chance that a patient will have some outcome of interest (for example, a treated 149 \npatient has a 10% risk of mortality and a control patient has a 12.5% risk of mortality). The relative 150 \nrisk refers to the chance of the outcome for one group of patients compared with another (in the 151 \ngiven example the relative risk of mortality decreases by 20% for the treatment group compared to 152 \nthe control group). The word \u2018risk\u2019 is used since the outcome is often unfavourable. However, since 153 \npregnancy is a favourable outcome the term \u2018risk\u2019 is generally replaced with \u2018chance\u2019. If the relative 154 \neffect of treatment is constant for all patients, then the absolute benefit of treatment only increases 155 \nin relation to the baseline pregnancy chances. For example, if statins have a constant relative risk 156 \nreduction for all, then the absolute benefit is highest for those at highest risk of cardiovascular 157 \ndisease (LaRosa et al., 1999). 158 \n 159 \nTo treat or not to treat? - A stratified medicine approach 160 \n \n \n8 \n \nStratified medicine has been defined as \u2018the targeting of treatments (including pharmaceutical and 161 \nnon-pharmaceutical interventions) according to the biological or risk characteristics shared by 162 \nsubgroups of patients\u2019 (Hingorani et al. 2013). A clinician will use such an approach where the 163 \nrelative effect of treatment is believed to be inconsistent across patients. This means one or more 164 \npatient characteristics are associated with changes in the relative effect of treatment. Such 165 \ncharacteristics are called predictive factors of treatment response (Hingorani et al. 2013). The 166 \nstratified medicine approach allows targeting of therapy based on the combination of subfertility 167 \nprognostic factors and such treatment predictive factors, which increase the response to treatment 168 \nin relation to no treatment. This enables decisions to be made regarding who should receive such 169 \ntreatment. For example, in non-small cell lung cancer, the response of the disease to chemotherapy 170 \nis quite poor but there are therapy agents, gefitinib and erlotinib, which optimise therapy by being 171 \neffective only in patients whose tumours harbour specific epidermal growth factor receptor profiles 172 \n(Hall 2013). 173 \nIn the stratified medicine approach the relative effect of treatment is allowed to vary across patients 174 \naccording to their treatment predictive factors. The relative increase in pregnancy chances for 175 \ntreatment in relation to no treatment has limited value since it does not tell us from what baseline 176 \nchance (i.e. chance of pregnancy without treatment) the increase occurs. Stratified medicine 177 \nconsiders the absolute rather than the relative increase in chance of pregnancy with treatment since 178 \nthe former provides the more relevant individualised prediction of successful treatment to guide 179 \ndecision-making. 180 \nSome thought needs to be given to identifying factors that predict differential treatment response. 181 \nIn fertility, the success of treatment, such as IVF, is heavily influenced by factors such as female age 182 \n(van Loendersloot et al. 2010). As age is also a subfertility prognostic factor, increasing age may vary 183 \nthe additional effect of treatment over expectant management on chances of pregnancy. In other 184 \nwords, prognostic factors such as age, which affect the chance of spontaneous pregnancy and 185 \n \n \n9 \n \nsuccess of IVF may also be treatment predictive factors which determine the relative effectiveness of 186 \ntreatment (Hingorani et al. 2013). Of interest is the difference in these two relative effects. 187 \nMoreover, it is likely that an older woman whose chance of pregnancy with treatment is expected to 188 \nbe better than without, will require a more rapid resolution involving assisted reproduction, whilst a 189 \nyounger patient has sufficient time to undergo a series of less invasive (and cheaper) alternatives 190 \nfirst. We know that as female age increases the ability of assisted reproduction technology to make 191 \nup for all births lost by the natural decline of fertility decreases (Leridon 2004). Nevertheless, the 192 \nabsolute (and relative) benefit of treatment may be larger in older women than for younger women.  193 \nThere may also exist factors that are not necessarily prognostic that may predict the treatment 194 \nresponse. For example, in women with different tubal factor subfertility problems those with 195 \nhydrosalpinges had a poorer IVF pregnancy rate, which can be improved by salpingectomy (Johnson 196 \net al. 2011). Within such a cohort of women, subfertility prognosis would not be expected to vary 197 \nbetween different tubal factor diagnoses, but type of tubal factor subfertility is clearly a treatment 198 \npredictive factor. 199 \n 200 \nIssues to consider for a stratified approach 201 \nA stratified model can be developed from: i. one data source that has compared treated versus 202 \nuntreated patient outcomes; or ii. two separate sources \u2013 one to model subfertility prognosis and 203 \none to predict outcome following treatment. We will discuss these in turn. 204 \nOne data source, one model 205 \nThis involves using one dataset, preferably from an RCT, comparing treatment with no treatment. 206 \nOne can then examine the effect of prognostic factors for subfertility (main effects in a statistical 207 \nmodel) (Figure 1, Model 2a) together with treatment predictive factors (interaction terms in a 208 \nstatistical model) (Figure 1, Model 2b). 209 \n \n \n10 \n \nWe could not find any examples of a published stratified medicine analysis for fertility using 210 \ntreatment predictive factors. However, a recent study attempted the secondary analysis of 211 \nindividual patient data from RCTs to determine whether a patient\u2019s prognostic profile, based on a 212 \nscore from the Hunault model, influenced the effectiveness of different fertility treatments (van den 213 \nBoogaard et al. 2013). Investigating how the prognostic score from a model affects the treatment 214 \nresponse, rather than the individual treatment predictive factors which made up the score, is called 215 \na risk-stratified analysis (Kent DM 2007). 216 \nDue to heterogeneity in the treatment protocols of the included trials in the Van den Boogaard study 217 \nit was not possible to combine the individual patient data from each trial to conduct a meta-analysis. 218 \nThe modelling was performed in each trial separately. The study found no effect of prognostic 219 \nprofile on the effectiveness of different clinical strategies, including expectant management. This 220 \nhighlights the need for large RCTs with more heterogeneity in patient characteristics if they are to be 221 \nused for secondary analyses involving modelling (Farooq et al. 2013). However, this is an expensive, 222 \nchallenging and lengthy process. 223 \nAlthough large RCTs are the preference for stratified medicine research, the use of observational 224 \ndata containing treated and non-treated women is an alternative. Such data usually contain a larger 225 \nand more varied sample of patients than an RCT. An observational design requires high quality 226 \nelectronic healthcare data that can be record-linked in order to obtain an accurate history of the 227 \npatient\u2019s journey (Hemingway et al., 2013). However, observational data can suffer from serious 228 \nselection bias issues, and whilst there are methods available that may be able to account for some of 229 \nthese, the results of any analyses should be interpreted with caution. 230 \n 231 \nTwo separate data sources, two models 232 \n \n \n11 \n \nIn the absence of RCTs or observational databases containing both treated and non-treated women, 233 \na third approach is possible. This can use either previously published models \u2013 e.g. a prognostic 234 \nmodel for spontaneous pregnancy, such as Hunault, and a model predicting treatment dependent 235 \npregnancy, such as the Nelson and Lawlor IVF model \u2013 or develop new models for each outcome 236 \nusing two separate data sources. The advantage of the former method is that most of the work has 237 \nalready been done and it is much less expensive than setting up a prospective, or even a 238 \nretrospective, database from scratch. The difference in the absolute probability of success from both 239 \nmodels would give the absolute benefit of treatment (Figure 1, Models 1a and 1b combined). 240 \nHowever, a key problem with this method is the comparability of cohorts. The limitations of 241 \ncombining models developed from two different cohorts were highlighted in the recently updated 242 \nNational Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline on assessment and treatment for 243 \npeople with fertility problems (National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health 244 \n2013). A health economic analysis to compare the cost-effectiveness of different treatment 245 \nstrategies over a woman\u2019s reproductive life used the Hunault and the Nelson and Lawlor models to 246 \ninform the cost-effectiveness model with probabilities of cumulative live birth in women following 247 \nspontaneous pregnancy and IVF dependent pregnancy respectively. However, as the guideline 248 \nacknowledges, there were major limitations associated with this approach. For example, the Hunault 249 \nmodel was developed using a cohort of subfertile women, which excluded those who would not be 250 \nexpected to conceive naturally, meaning the severity of subfertility may not be as high as that in 251 \nwomen referred for IVF (the cohort used for the Nelson and Lawlor models). Further, the maximum 252 \nage of women used to develop the Hunault model was less than the maximum age included in the 253 \nNICE cost-effectiveness model, which may result in an overestimate of the probability of 254 \nspontaneous live birth in older aged women. However, if separate cohorts exist, which contain 255 \npatients with very similar characteristics, who undergo either expectant management or treatment, 256 \nthen previous models can be adapted to fit such data or new models can be developed. If such 257 \n \n \n12 \n \ncohorts are available then this two-model approach would be equivalent to using the one model 258 \napproach with statistical interaction terms between treatment and the treatment predictive factors. 259 \n 260 \nWhen to treat? \u2013 A dynamic prediction approach 261 \nAnother major aspect of clinical decision-making concerns the length of time couples should be 262 \nadvised to continue trying to conceive naturally before treatment should be offered. In order to do 263 \nthis we need a dynamic approach where we constantly assess the change in subfertility prognosis at 264 \ndifferent points in the future. One method is dynamic prediction modelling (van Houwelingen and 265 \nPutter 2012). This involves fitting multiple time to event models from sequential equally spaced time 266 \npoints to predict natural pregnancy over, say, the following year (see Figure 2). This process enables 267 \none to determine the impact of delayed treatment on the predicted probability of pregnancy at 268 \ndifferent points in time. This is not the same as using, for example the Hunault model, to obtain the 269 \nupdated chances of pregnancy as time goes on by iteratively updating the same woman\u2019s prognostic 270 \nfactors for subfertility at baseline (i.e. when the cause of infertility is established). Rather, as time 271 \nprogresses the more fertile couples are excluded from the cohort due to pregnancy.  Therefore 272 \nafter, for example, 6 months the cohort has reduced in size and is less fertile on average than the full 273 \nsized cohort on which the model was originally based.  Furthermore, since the original follow-up 274 \nperiod has been extended by 6 months (i.e. follow-up now ends 18 months from baseline as 275 \nopposed to 12 months) some of the women may have conceived during this period. Thus, different 276 \nmodel estimates will be obtained. 277 \nDynamic prediction could be used to advise those patients who are found to have a high chance of 278 \nconceiving spontaneously at their first visit on when to return for treatment if their attempts are 279 \nunsuccessful e.g. when their absolute chance of pregnancy dips below some pre-specified threshold. 280 \n \n \n13 \n \nIt could also be used to make decisions regarding the immediate treatment for couples who have a 281 \nlow probability of pregnancy at their initial visit, which will decline further with each passing month. 282 \nDynamic prediction should be used with the stratified medicine approach in order to estimate the 283 \nchange in the absolute benefit of treatment over time. In a couple with a good subfertility prognosis 284 \ninitially advised expectant management, this approach could be used to decide when in the future 285 \nthe absolute benefit of treatment is likely to trump their chance of spontaneous pregnancy such that 286 \nthe couple should be advised to return for treatment. 287 \nDynamic prediction requires a cohort of patients with a sufficient length of follow-up to enable 288 \nmodelling at different time points. For this reason, existing observational datasets would be more 289 \nsuitable than an RCT. Finally, as for all clinical prediction modelling, the key steps involved in 290 \ndevelopment and validation should be considered. The latter have been highlighted in the 291 \nPROGRESS series (Steyerberg et al. 2013). 292 \n 293 \nPractical recommendations 294 \nGiven the complexities of the above approach to individualised-decision making in subfertility 295 \ntreatment, it is worth considering some practical guidelines for clinical practice and research. Firstly, 296 \nthe decision whether to treat a subfertile patient requires careful consideration of her background 297 \nchance of spontaneous pregnancy and her predicted response to treatment. The former is 298 \ninfluenced by prognostic factors and the latter by treatment predictive factors. Currently, in the 299 \nNetherlands, an online prediction tool called \u2018Freya\u2019, based on the Hunault model, is used in clinical 300 \npractice to make treatment decisions based on the probability of spontaneous ongoing pregnancy 301 \nwithin the next 12 months (Hunault et al. 2004). However, clinicians should be aware that this model 302 \ndoes not provide an estimate of response to treatment. Currently, the only way to do this is to use a 303 \ncombination of existing models from the literature, such as the Hunault model and the Nelson and 304 \n \n \n14 \n \nLawlor model, which can be used to predict the chance of live birth following IVF. As mentioned 305 \nearlier, this approach was used in a cost-effectiveness analysis of IVF relative to expectant 306 \nmanagement by NICE who acknowledge the shortcomings of this approach (National Collaborating 307 \nCentre for Women's and Children's Health 2013). 308 \n 309 \nSecondly, clinicians looking after couples with unexplained subfertility need to make a conscious 310 \ndecision as to when treatment should be offered. Depending on patient characteristics, such as 311 \nfemale age, the live birth rate following one or more episodes of treatment will vary compared to 312 \nwhat might be expected without treatment. Thus, it may be better to treat some women straight 313 \naway after a diagnosis has been made, whilst in others a period of expectant management may lead 314 \nto comparable or better live birth rates without the expense and invasiveness of active treatment. 315 \nFrom the NICE analysis using the combined models, a 34 year old woman with two years of 316 \nunexplained infertility is predicted to have a treatment independent live birth rate of 20% (National 317 \nCollaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health 2013) compared to 40% after one cycle of 318 \nIVF. The same model predicts a live birth rate of 55% without treatment versus 70% following three 319 \ncomplete cycles of IVF over the next 11 years, suggesting that it would seem advantageous to offer 320 \nIVF treatment. 321 \nFinally, output from clinical predictive models need to be interpreted in the context of the individual 322 \ncircumstances of each couple. For fertility care to be genuinely patient centred, treatment decisions 323 \nshould involve couples themselves and accommodate their personal values and preferences (Dancet 324 \net al. 2011). 325 \n 326 \nConclusions 327 \n \n \n15 \n \nThe current one-year definition of infertility should be used as a trigger for referral to the fertility 328 \nclinic in order to initiate investigations and estimate prognosis \u2013 but not necessarily to begin 329 \ntreatment in all. 330 \nCurrent prognostic models in reproductive medicine are reasonably good at predicting the chances 331 \nof pregnancy in either women who are treated or those who are not. As none of the existing models 332 \ninclude both groups, predicting the marginal benefit of treatment versus no treatment is less 333 \naccurate. 334 \nWe advise the stratified medicine approach to identify those who actually benefit more from fertility 335 \ntreatment based on their prognostic and treatment predictive factors. Subsequently, the added 336 \nbenefit of treatment needs to be considered in context, for example in relation to the age of the 337 \nwoman. We also advise the dynamic prediction approach to estimate the patient\u2019s changing 338 \nsubfertility prognosis over time which could inform the decision about when to treat. 339 \nFurther research needs to be undertaken to identify treatment predictive factors and to identify or 340 \ncreate databases to allow these approaches to be explored. RCT data are preferred, but are the most 341 \nchallenging and expensive choice. In the interim, the most feasible option is to use output from a 342 \ncombination of previously published clinical prediction models, whilst acknowledging the specific 343 \nclinical circumstances of each couple and their preferences. 344 \n 345 \nAuthor\u2019s roles 346 \nDJM, SB and EWS proposed the concept.
