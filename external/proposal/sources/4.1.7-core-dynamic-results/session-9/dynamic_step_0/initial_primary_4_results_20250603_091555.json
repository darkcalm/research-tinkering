This Part provides a brief primer on climate change. It focuses \non its technical and data challenges and provides examples of AI\u2019s generic \nclimate applications for reducing GHGs. \nA.

Artificial Intelligence for Optimizing Grid Assets \nOne of the most obvious AI applications for the electricity sector involves \noptimizing grid assets: improving the way energy is used in the grid, both for \nconservation and efficiency purposes.77 While the U.S. grid has historically \nbeen comprised of thousands of large, centralized generation sources (for \nexample, power plants), the grid has been undergoing a significant \ntransformation. This transformation includes an increase in renewable \ngeneration sources, many of which are taking the form of smaller, distributed \nresources (for example, rooftop solar and energy storage), a smart grid to help \nfacilitate these resources, and a shift toward more electric vehicles. This section \naddresses AI applications in each of these four areas. \nIntermittent Renewables. A first step to reduce GHG emissions from the \nelectricity sector is to shift the country\u2019s reliance from fossil fuels to \nrenewables. In 2019, the United States relied on fossil fuels for approximately \nsixty-three percent of its electricity needs.78 Renewable penetration, however, \nhas been growing steadily and is projected to comprise seventy-six percent of \nnew planned U.S. generating capacity in 2020.79 But much of renewable energy \n \n73.

For instance, Google and DeepMind applied \nmachine learning to wind power capacity in the United States \u201cto better predict \nwind power output thirty-six hours ahead of actual generation,\u201d assisting in \noptimal hourly day-ahead delivery commitments.82 Google claims that the use \nof machine learning boosted the value of its wind energy by approximately \ntwenty percent.83 \n\u201cAI is increasingly being used to manage the intermittency of renewable \nenergy so that more can be incorporated into the grid; it can handle power \nfluctuations and improve energy storage as well.\u201d84 For example, AI can be \nused to adjust wind-farm propellers to keep up with changing wind directions, \ntherefore decreasing the intermittency issue of wind turbines.85 Similarly, AI \ncan help design the layout of renewable energy sources, such as solar power or \nwind-turbine farms.86 Perhaps most impressively, AI can improve the storage \nof renewable energy during intermittent periods of downtime87 by maximizing \nthe efficiency of large energy batteries to prolong their lifespans with fewer \nissues.88 Such efficiency maximization requires large-scale data analysis, \nmaking it ideal for AI involvement.89 \nDistributed Resources.

At least two \navenues exist to help facilitate such collaborations: (1) rigorous procedures for \nanonymizing energy data; and (2) regulating data ownership, each of which is \ndiscussed below. \nAnonymizing Data. Anonymization of data is a commonly used technique \nfor protecting data privacy. Anonymization is the process of deidentifying data, \nsuch that the information can no longer \u201creasonably identify, relate to, describe, \nreference, be capable of being associated with, or be linked, directly or \nindirectly, to a particular individual.\u201d251 Common data-anonymization \ntechniques include randomization252 and generalization.253 \nIn the United States, data-protection laws provide safe harbors for entities \nthat anonymize their data.254 However, anonymized data is often not entirely \n \na warrant in a drug operation to gather electricity data from a home because it did not \u201creveal intimate \ndetails about activity within the home\u201d); People v.

Rptr. 2d 89, 94 (App. 1999) (holding \nthat no warrant was needed to gather data on energy consumption because \u201c[i]t only tells officers how \nmuch electricity is being delivered by the utility and, by comparison to billing records, whether it is \nbeing diverted or stolen\u201d). \n249.

The lack of the ability to have this data, then, hampers \nthe development of the sharing economy and the grid and environmental benefits that could come along \nwith it.\u201d). Although it is not a data sharing organization, sharing technology may be similarly critical. \nSee About Us, INDUS.

Just as human \nfingerprints left at a crime scene can uniquely identify a single person and link \nthat person with \u201canonymous\u201d information, so too do data subjects generate \n\u201cdata fingerprints\u201d\u2014combinations of values of data shared by nobody else in \ntheir table.255 \nThe proposed Online Privacy Act of 2019 addresses these re-identification \nconcerns but did not take an aggressive stance on mandatory anonymization.256 \nIt only required anonymization where efforts to do so are \u201creasonable,\u201d257 a \ncondition that may preclude anonymization of massive amounts of smart meter \ndata,258 not just when it is not \u201can unreasonable amount of effort.\u201d259 \nRegulating Data Ownership. A last option would be the regulation of data \nownership, its use, and its distribution.260 Generally, utility-company customers \nhave a right to access the data, but there are varying views on whether third \nparties can access this data,261 as well as who owns the data.262 Congress has \nalready begun to address these complicated issues, including allowing \ninterested persons access to nonspecific utility-customer information.263 \n \n45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.502 (2019).

If AI has the potential to serve as a cost-effective \ndiagnostic tool for the electric industry to reduce GHGs, why aren\u2019t all the \nutilities jumping on board? One answer may lie in the difficulties of obtaining \ncost recovery for emerging technologies.274 Decisions about cost recovery for \nutility investments, including emerging technologies, are made by state PUCs. \nGiven how many utilities need to obtain regulatory approvals of their \nexpenditures to obtain cost recovery, a critical factor in the advancement of AI \nto enhance efficiencies across the electricity sector is the regulatory treatment \nof emerging technologies. \nEmerging technologies are those that have not been readily proven, and \nchange with the times.275 Nuclear plants were once considered emerging \ntechnologies, as were combined-cycle natural-gas plants.

In addition to PUC hesitancy, investors may similarly view such \nuncertainties as unfavorable in their return-on-investment forecasts. \nEfforts to support such emerging technologies are further hindered by \nexamples of technologies that were approved and failed to meet their potential. \nSuch failures can cost customers millions of dollars, as did Duke Energy\u2019s \nfailed attempts to update and build two nuclear plants, costing ratepayers more \nthan $3 billion.280 Relatedly, an approval of a nuclear repair project in Southern \nCalifornia went awry and cost ratepayers $3.3 billion dollars.281 Even if the \nproject is not an outright failure, a perceived lack of success by ratepayers can \nbe almost as damaging as a complete failure.282 Such failures tend to remain \nfresh on the mind and can be damning for subsequent emerging technologies. \n \n276.

For example, one study found that new medical technologies raised \nhospital expenses by twenty-five percent within a period of only six years.289 \nRenewable technologies provide yet another example. For years, solar-\nenergy generation was significantly more expensive than conventional energy \nsources like natural gas.290 At least a portion of that cost is caused by the fact \nthat as an emerging technology, solar power lacked the infrastructure needed to \nmake it compete significantly with conventional gas.291 But the high demand \nfor solar energy in recent years has driven down prices to the point where they \nare now on par with conventional energy generation.292 The cost of wind \npower, and especially onshore wind power, also now rivals that of fossil \nfuels.293 \nSimilarly, there may be a steep investment curve associated with the use \nof AI. Using AI may require new hardware and software, cloud costs, energy \nand data center costs, training costs, system and business-process integration \ncosts, and manpower.294 And as researchers work to gather, clean, and use data, \nit may be quite expensive to train electricity-sector models to perform as \ndesired.295 As with other emerging technologies, it may be important to \ndevelop a return-on-investment strategy that takes into account some of the \ndifficult-to-quantify benefits of implementing AI in the electricity sector like \nenhanced efficiency, avoided costs, reduced manpower, and improved accuracy \nin results.296 \nAccounting for Capital versus Operating Costs.

Public Investment in Artificial Intelligence \nIn addition to private investment in AI for climate, public funding is \nimperative to its success. Governments at all levels can look for opportunities \nto invest in climate-related AI, as well as adjust government-procurement \npolicies that could harness its benefits. For example, over the last few years, the \nEU government has been proactive in generating funding for AI-related \nprojects.323 The U.S. government has also taken steps toward a more active role \nin AI use and development.324 Over the last ten years, the Department of \nEnergy has invested billions of dollars into new energy infrastructure that \ninterfaces with AI technology to improve energy efficiency.325 Public utilities \n \n317.

Accountability, Safety, and Certification \nA last area of concern is accountability, safety, and certification. This \ninvolves at least two components. First, it demands caution to prevent entities \nfrom labeling everything as \u201cAI\u201d to qualify for funding, cost recovery, and \ngeneral acceptance. Second, processes need to be in place to ensure that AI is \nperforming as expected, which may demand more explainable AI. At present, it \nis extremely difficult to perform \u201cquality control\u201d on AI before we set it loose \non the power grid as no one can fully predict how it will perform.328 Each of \nthese concerns is addressed below. \nAvoiding AI-Washing. The first concern is that of \u201cAI-washing.\u201d Much \nlike whitewashing329 and greenwashing,330 it is imperative that AI not be used \nas a catchall for all matters involving data processing. AI has been around since \nthe 1950s, and yet it has come through its AI winter331 in full bloom. As AI has \nmoved from relative obscurity to common parlance,332 it now carries a certain \ncache that many can use to their advantage.333 Some suggest that people use the \n \n326.

Should entities label their activities as \n\u201cAI\u201d to qualify for certain advantages, AI could become a watered-down term. \nAnd should entities try to squeeze their activities into an \u201cAI\u201d box when that \ndesignation is questionable, it could cast doubt on valid AI. \nOne solution to this concern may be to elicit the assistance of the Federal \nTrade Commission (FTC).
