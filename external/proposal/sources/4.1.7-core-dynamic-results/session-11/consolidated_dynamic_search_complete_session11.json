        "title": "A survey on smart grid communication infrastructures: Motivations, requirements and challenges",
        "abstract": "A communication infrastructure is an essential part to the success of the emerging smart grid. A scalable and pervasive communication infrastructure is crucial in both construction and operation of a smart grid. In this paper, we present the background and motivation of communication infrastructures in smart grid systems. We also summarize major requirements that smart grid communications must meet. From the experience of several industrial trials on smart grid with communication infrastructures, we expect that the traditional carbon fuel based power plants can cooperate with emerging distributed renewable energy such as wind, solar, etc, to reduce the carbon fuel consumption and consequent green house gas such as carbon dioxide emission. The consumers can minimize their expense on energy by adjusting their intelligent home appliance operations to avoid the peak hours and utilize the renewable energy instead. We further explore the challenges for a communication infrastructure as the part of a complex smart grid system. Since a smart grid system might have over millions of consumers and devices, the demand of its reliability and security is extremely critical. Through a communication infrastructure, a smart grid can improve power reliability and quality to eliminate electricity blackout. Security is a challenging issue since the on-going smart grid systems facing increasing vulnerabilities as more and more automation, remote monitoring/controlling and supervision entities are interconnected. \u00a9 1998-2012 IEEE",

        "title": "Algorithms for advance bandwidth reservation in media production networks",
        "abstract": "Media production generally requires many geographically distributed actors (e.g., production houses, broadcasters, advertisers) to exchange huge amounts of raw video and audio data. Traditional distribution techniques, such as dedicated point-to-point optical links, are highly inefficient in terms of installation time and cost. To improve efficiency, shared media production networks that connect all involved actors over a large geographical area, are currently being deployed. The traffic in such networks is often predictable, as the timing and bandwidth requirements of data transfers are generally known hours or even days in advance. As such, the use of advance bandwidth reservation (AR) can greatly increase resource utilization and cost efficiency. In this paper, we propose an Integer Linear Programming formulation of the bandwidth scheduling problem, which takes into account the specific characteristics of media production networks, is presented. Two novel optimization algorithms based on this model are thoroughly evaluated and compared by means of in-depth simulation results",

        "abstract": "This report discusses a new maturity model that regulators and utilities can use to guide and expand demand flexibility programs and enable the resources to provide more grid services. The model has six demand flexibility categories: planning and design; customer engagement; program operations; evaluation, measurement and verification; distributed energy resource orchestration; and data infrastructure. Within each category, capabilities are identified and described on a maturity scale that ranges from performing below expectations to improving on best practices",

        "abstract": "This paper presents one of the first real-life demonstrations of coordinated\nand distributed resource control for secondary frequency response in a power\ndistribution grid. We conduct a series of tests with up to 69 heterogeneous\nactive devices consisting of air handling units, unidirectional and\nbidirectional electric vehicle charging stations, a battery energy storage\nsystem, and 107 passive devices consisting of building loads and photovoltaic\ngenerators. Actuation commands for the test devices are obtained by solving an\neconomic dispatch problem at every regulation instant using distributed\nratio-consensus, primal-dual, and Newton-like algorithms. The distributed\ncontrol setup consists of a set of Raspberry Pi end-points exchanging messages\nvia an ethernet switch. The problem formulation minimizes the sum of device\ncosts while tracking the setpoints provided by the system operator. We\ndemonstrate accurate and fast real-time distributed computation of the\noptimization solution and effective tracking of the regulation signal by\nmeasuring physical device outputs over 40-minute time horizons. We also perform\nan economic benefit analysis which confirms eligibility to participate in an\nancillary services market and demonstrates up to $53K of potential annual\nrevenue for the selected population of devices",

        "abstract": "The increasing adoption of distributed energy resources (DERs) and smart grid technologies (SGTs) by end-user retail customers is changing significantly both technical and economic operations in the distribution grid. The next-generation retail electricity market will promote decentralization, efficiency, and competitiveness by accommodating existing and new agents through new business models and transactive approaches in an advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). However, these changes will bring several technical challenges to be addressed in transmission and distribution systems. Considerable activities have been carried out worldwide to study the impacts of integrating DERs into the grid and in the wholesale electricity market. However, the big vision and framework of the next-generation retail market in the context of DERs is still unclear. This paper aims to present a brief review of the present retail electricity market, some recent developments, and a comprehensive vision of the next-generation retail electricity market by describing its expected characteristics, challenges, needs, and future research topics to be addressed. A framework of integrating retail and wholesale electricity markets is also presented and discussed. The proposed vision and framework particularly highlight the necessity of new business models and regulatory initiatives to establish decentralized markets for DERs at the retail level as well as advances in technology and infrastructure necessary to allow the widespread use of DERs in active and effective ways",

In den meisten F\u00e4llen sind die Abl\u00e4ufe\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnicht nur durch den physischen Aufbau der Produktionsanlage, sondern auch durch\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdie spezielle zugeschnittene Programmierung der Anlagensteuerung fest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvorgegeben. \u00c4nderungen m\u00fcssen aufw\u00e4ndig in einer Vielzahl von Systemen\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnachgezogen werden.

Im Vergleich zu\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   existierenden Modellen von Produktionsanlagen werden weniger limitierende\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Annahmen gestellt.

Der Algorithmus verbindet Techniken f\u00fcr die\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   kombinatorische und die kontinuierliche Optimierung: Je nach Detailgrad und\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Ausgestaltung des modellierten Szenarios kann der identische Algorithmus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   kombinatorische Fertigungsfeinplanung (Scheduling) vornehmen, weltweite\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Lieferbeziehungen unter Einbezug von Unsicherheiten und Risiko optimieren und\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   physikalische Prozesse pr\u00e4diktiv regeln. Daf\u00fcr werden Techniken der\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Monte-Carlo Baumsuche (die auch bei Deepminds Alpha Go zum Einsatz kommen)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   weiterentwickelt. Durch Ausnutzung zus\u00e4tzlicher Struktur in den Modellen\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   skaliert der Ansatz auch auf gro\u00dfe Szenarien.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3. Der Planungsalgorithmus wird auf die verteilte Optimierung durch unabh\u00e4ngige\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Agenten \u00fcbertragen. Daf\u00fcr wird die sogenannte \"Nutzen-Propagation\" als\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Koordinations-Mechanismus entwickelt. Diese ist von der Belief-Propagation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   zur Inferenz in Probabilistischen Graphischen Modellen inspiriert. Jeder\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   teilnehmende Agent hat einen lokalen Handlungsraum, in dem er den\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Systemzustand beobachten und handelnd eingreifen kann. Die Agenten sind an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   der Maximierung der Gesamtwohlfahrt \u00fcber alle Agenten hinweg interessiert.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Die daf\u00fcr notwendige Kooperation entsteht \u00fcber den Austausch von Nachrichten\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   zwischen benachbarten Agenten. Die Nachrichten beschreiben den erwarteten\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Nutzen f\u00fcr ein angenommenes Verhalten im Handlungsraum beider Agenten.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4. Es wird eine Beschreibung der wiederverwendbaren F\u00e4higkeiten von Maschinen\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   und Anlagen auf Basis formaler Beschreibungslogiken entwickelt. Ausgehend von\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   den beschriebenen F\u00e4higkeiten, sowie der vorliegenden Auftr\u00e4ge mit ihren\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   notwendigen Produktionsschritten, werden ausf\u00fchrbare Aktionen abgeleitet. Die\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   ausf\u00fchrbaren Aktionen, mit wohldefinierten Vorbedingungen und Effekten,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   kapseln ben\u00f6tigte Parametrierungen, programmierte Abl\u00e4ufe und die\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Synchronisation von Maschinen zur Laufzeit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDie Ergebnisse zusammenfassend werden Grundlagen f\u00fcr flexible automatisierte\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProduktionssysteme geschaffen -- in einer Werkshalle, aber auch \u00fcber Standorte\n\t\t\t\t\t\tund Organisationen verteilt -- welche die ihnen innewohnenden Freiheitsgrade\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdurch Planung zur Laufzeit und agentenbasierte Koordination gezielt einsetzen\n\t\t\t\t\t\tk\u00f6nnen. Der Bezug zur Praxis wird durch Anwendungsbeispiele hergestellt. Die\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMachbarkeit des Ansatzes wurde mit realen Maschinen im Rahmen des EU-Projekts\n\t\t\t\t\tSkillPro und in einer Simulationsumgebung mit weiteren Szenarien demonstriert",

        "abstract": "Internet-of-Things (IoT) envisions an intelligent infrastructure of networked\nsmart devices offering task-specific monitoring and control services. The\nunique features of IoT include extreme heterogeneity, massive number of\ndevices, and unpredictable dynamics partially due to human interaction. These\ncall for foundational innovations in network design and management. Ideally, it\nshould allow efficient adaptation to changing environments, and low-cost\nimplementation scalable to massive number of devices, subject to stringent\nlatency constraints. To this end, the overarching goal of this paper is to\noutline a unified framework for online learning and management policies in IoT\nthrough joint advances in communication, networking, learning, and\noptimization. From the network architecture vantage point, the unified\nframework leverages a promising fog architecture that enables smart devices to\nhave proximity access to cloud functionalities at the network edge, along the\ncloud-to-things continuum. From the algorithmic perspective, key innovations\ntarget online approaches adaptive to different degrees of nonstationarity in\nIoT dynamics, and their scalable model-free implementation under limited\nfeedback that motivates blind or bandit approaches. The proposed framework\naspires to offer a stepping stone that leads to systematic designs and analysis\nof task-specific learning and management schemes for IoT, along with a host of\nnew research directions to build on.Comment: Submitted on June 15 to Proceeding of IEEE Special Issue on Adaptive\n  and Scalable Communication Network",

        "abstract": "The effort to continuously improve and innovate smart appliances (SA) energy management requires an experimental research and development environment which integrates widely differing tools and resources seamlessly. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Direct Load Control (DLC) testbed, aiming to conveniently support the research community, as well as analyzing and comparing their designs in a laboratory environment. Based on the LabVIEW computing platform, this original testbed enables access to knowledge of major components such as online weather forecasting information, distributed energy resources (e.g., energy storage, solar photovoltaic), dynamic electricity tariff from utilities and demand response (DR) providers together with different mathematical optimization features given by General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS). This intercommunication is possible thanks to the different applications programming interfaces (API) incorporated into the system and to intermediate agents specially developed for this case. Different basic case studies have been presented to envision the possibilities of this system in the future and more complex scenarios, to actively support the DLC strategies. These measures will offer enough flexibility to minimize the impact on user comfort combined with support for multiple DR programs. Thus, given the successful results, this platform can lead to a solution towards more efficient use of energy in the residential environment",

        "abstract": "abstract: The grand transition of electric grids from conventional fossil fuel resources to intermittent bulk renewable resources and distributed energy resources (DERs) has initiated a paradigm shift in power system operation. Distributed energy resources (i.e. rooftop solar photovoltaic, battery storage, electric vehicles, and demand response), communication infrastructures, and smart measurement devices provide the opportunity for electric utility customers to play an active role in power system operation and even benefit financially from this opportunity. However, new operational challenges have been introduced due to the intrinsic characteristics of DERs such as intermittency of renewable resources, distributed nature of these resources, variety of DERs technologies and human-in-the-loop effect. Demand response (DR) is one of DERs and is highly influenced by human-in-the-loop effect. A data-driven based analysis is implemented to analyze and reveal the customers price responsiveness, and human-in-the-loop effect. The results confirm the critical impact of demographic characteristics of customers on their interaction with smart grid and their quality of service (QoS). The proposed framework is also applicable to other types of DERs. A chance-constraint based second-order-cone programming AC optimal power flow (SOCP-ACOPF) is utilized to dispatch DERs in distribution grid with knowing customers price responsiveness and energy output distribution. The simulation shows that the reliability of distribution gird can be improved by using chance-constraint.Dissertation/ThesisMasters Thesis Electrical Engineering 201",

        "title": "Multi-Agent Decision Support Tool to Enable Interoperability among Heterogeneous Energy Systems",
        "abstract": "Worldwide electricity markets are undergoing a major restructuring process. One of the main reasons for the ongoing changes is to enable the adaptation of current market models to the new paradigm that arises from the large-scale integration of distributed generation sources. In order to deal with the unpredictability caused by the intermittent nature of the distributed generation and the large number of variables that contribute to the energy sector balance, it is extremely important to use simulation systems that are capable of dealing with the required complexity. This paper presents the Tools Control Center (TOOCC), a framework that allows the interoperability between heterogeneous energy and power simulation systems through the use of ontologies, allowing the simulation of scenarios with a high degree of complexity, through the cooperation of the individual capacities of each system. A case study based on real data is presented in order to demonstrate the interoperability capabilities of TOOCC. The simulation considers the energy management of a microgrid of a real university campus, from the perspective of the network manager and also of its consumers/producers, in a projection for a typical day of the winter of 2050.This work has been developed in the scope of the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 641794 (project DREAM-GO); CONTEST project - SAICT-POL/23575/2016; and has also been supported by FEDER Funds through COMPETE program and from National Funds through FCT under the project UID/EEA/00760/2013.info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio",

        "abstract": "In the push to develop smart energy systems, designers have increasingly focused on systems that measure and predict user behavior to effect optimal energy consumption. While such focus is an important component in these systems' success, designers have paid substantially less attention to the people on the other side of the energy system loop-the supervisors of power generation processes. Smart energy systems that leverage pervasive computing could add to these supervisory control operators' workload. They'll have to predict possible power plant load and production changes caused by environmental and plant events, as well as dynamic system adaptation in response to consumer behaviors. Contrary to many assumptions, inserting more automation, including distributed sensors and algorithms to postprocess data, won't necessarily reduce operators' workload or improve system performance",

To address this gap, we describe the\nresults of a systematic review of the AI-assisted decision making literature,\nanalyzing 105 selected articles, which grounds the introduction of a taxonomy\nof interaction patterns that delineate various modes of human-AI interactivity.\nWe find that current interactions are dominated by simplistic collaboration\nparadigms and report comparatively little support for truly interactive\nfunctionality. Our taxonomy serves as a valuable tool to understand how\ninteractivity with AI is currently supported in decision-making contexts and\nfoster deliberate choices of interaction designs",

        "abstract": "In everyday life, people often depend on their theory of mind, i.e., their ability to reason about unobservable mental content of others to understand, explain, and predict their behaviour. Many agent-based models have been designed to develop computational theory of mind and analyze its effectiveness in various tasks and settings. However, most existing models are not generic (e.g., only applied in a given setting), not feasible (e.g., require too much information to be processed), or not human-inspired (e.g., do not capture the behavioral heuristics of humans). This hinders their applicability in many settings. Accordingly, we propose a new computational theory of mind, which captures the human decision heuristics of reasoning by abstracting individual beliefs about others. We specifically study computational affinity and show how it can be used in tandem with theory of mind reasoning when designing agent models for human-agent negotiation. We perform two-agent simulations to analyze the role of affinity in getting to agreements when there is a bound on the time to be spent for negotiating. Our results suggest that modeling affinity can ease the negotiation process by decreasing the number of rounds needed for an agreement as well as yield a higher benefit for agents with theory of mind reasoning.</p",

        "abstract": "Leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) in decision support systems has disproportionately focused on technological advancements, often overlooking the alignment between algorithmic outputs and human expectations. A human-centered perspective attempts to alleviate this concern by designing AI solutions for seamless integration with existing processes. Determining what information AI should provide to aid humans is vital, a concept underscored by explainable AI's efforts to justify AI predictions. However, how the information is presented, e.g., the sequence of recommendations and solicitation of interpretations, is equally crucial as complex interactions may emerge between humans and AI. While empirical studies have evaluated human-AI dynamics across domains, a common vocabulary for human-AI interaction protocols is lacking. To promote more deliberate consideration of interaction designs, we introduce a taxonomy of interaction patterns that delineate various modes of human-AI interactivity. We summarize the results of a systematic review of AI-assisted decision making literature and identify trends and opportunities in existing interactions across application domains from 105 articles. We find that current interactions are dominated by simplistic collaboration paradigms, leading to little support for truly interactive functionality. Our taxonomy offers a tool to understand interactivity with AI in decision-making and foster interaction designs for achieving clear communication, trustworthiness, and collaboration",

The various chapters of the book provide a broad coverage of AI systems for state of the art flexible production lines including both cyber-physical production systems (Industry 4.0) and emerging trustworthy and human-centered manufacturing systems (Industry 5.0). From a technology perspective, the book addresses a wide range of AI paradigms such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, active learning, agent-based systems, explainable AI, industrial robots, and AI-based digital twins. Emphasis is put on system architectures and technologies that foster human-AI collaboration based on trusted interactions between workers and AI systems. From a manufacturing applications perspective, the book illustrates the deployment of these AI paradigms in a variety of use cases spanning production planning, quality control, anomaly detection, metrology, workers\u2019 training, supply chain management, as well as various production optimization scenarios.

        "abstract": "The researchers developed a new generation of high-performance fa\u00e7ade systems and supporting design and management tools to support industry in meeting California\u2019s greenhouse gas reduction targets, reduce energy consumption, and enable an adaptable response to minimize real-time demands on the electricity grid. The project resulted in five outcomes: (1) The research team developed an R-5, 1-inch thick, triplepane, insulating glass unit with a novel low-conductance aluminum frame. This technology can help significantly reduce residential cooling and heating loads, particularly during the evening. (2) The team developed a prototype of a windowintegrated local ventilation and energy recovery device that provides clean, dry fresh air through the fa\u00e7ade with minimal energy requirements. (3) A daylight-redirecting louver system was prototyped to redirect sunlight 15\u201340 feet from the window. Simulations estimated that lighting energy use could be reduced by 35\u201354 percent without glare. (4) A control system incorporating physics-based equations and a mathematical solver was prototyped and field tested to demonstrate feasibility. Simulations estimated that total electricity costs could be reduced by 9-28 percent on sunny summer days through adaptive control of operable shading and daylighting components and the thermostat compared to state-of-the-art automatic fa\u00e7ade controls in commercial building perimeter zones. (5) Supporting models and tools needed by industry for technology R&amp;D and market transformation activities were validated. Attaining California\u2019s clean energy goals require making a fundamental shift from today\u2019s ad-hoc assemblages of static components to turnkey, intelligent, responsive, integrated building fa\u00e7ade systems. These systems offered significant reductions in energy use, peak demand, and operating cost in California",

        "title": "Defining Problem from Solutions: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)\n  and Its Applications for Next-Generation Networking",
        "abstract": "Performance optimization is a critical concern in networking, on which Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved great success. Nonetheless, DRL\ntraining relies on precisely defined reward functions, which formulate the\noptimization objective and indicate the positive/negative progress towards the\noptimal. With the ever-increasing environmental complexity and human\nparticipation in Next-Generation Networking (NGN), defining appropriate reward\nfunctions become challenging. In this article, we explore the applications of\nInverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) in NGN. Particularly, if DRL aims to find\noptimal solutions to the problem, IRL finds a problem from the optimal\nsolutions, where the optimal solutions are collected from experts, and the\nproblem is defined by reward inference. Specifically, we first formally\nintroduce the IRL technique, including its fundamentals, workflow, and\ndifference from DRL. Afterward, we present the motivations of IRL applications\nin NGN and survey existing studies. Furthermore, to demonstrate the process of\napplying IRL in NGN, we perform a case study about human-centric prompt\nengineering in Generative AI-enabled networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof using both DRL and IRL techniques and prove the superiority of IRL.Comment: 9 page",

        "title": "Optimizing the Cost of an Heterogeneous Distributed Platform",
        "abstract": "International audienceDistributed platforms become heterogeneous in more and more domains, as heterogeneous computing (HC) onto grids or reconfigurable factories in the industry. For production grids and factories, it is mandatory to control and optimize the economic cost of a such platforms regarding performance objectives. We present in this paper a study which purpose is to optimize the size of such environments depending on the workflow to execute or product to realize. The target platforms are either micro-factories, sized to manufacture products at the micrometric scale, or the heterogeneous computing domain where the key point is to reserve processors of an execution platform onto a grid to compute workflows like medical imaging applications. Thanks to the sizing of the platform, optimal or not, scheduling a workflow in HC environment or a production in the micro-factory is easy because the size of the platform already takes the performance constraints into account. In this paper, we present general results on the platform size optimization. Numerical results are also presented to illustrate 3 cases of our study",

        "abstract": "This report discusses many-task computing (MTC) generically and in the\ncontext of the proposed Blue Waters systems, which is planned to be the largest\nNSF-funded supercomputer when it begins production use in 2012. The aim of this\nreport is to inform the BW project about MTC, including understanding aspects\nof MTC applications that can be used to characterize the domain and\nunderstanding the implications of these aspects to middleware and policies.\nMany MTC applications do not neatly fit the stereotypes of high-performance\ncomputing (HPC) or high-throughput computing (HTC) applications. Like HTC\napplications, by definition MTC applications are structured as graphs of\ndiscrete tasks, with explicit input and output dependencies forming the graph\nedges. However, MTC applications have significant features that distinguish\nthem from typical HTC applications. In particular, different engineering\nconstraints for hardware and software must be met in order to support these\napplications. HTC applications have traditionally run on platforms such as\ngrids and clusters, through either workflow systems or parallel programming\nsystems. MTC applications, in contrast, will often demand a short time to\nsolution, may be communication intensive or data intensive, and may comprise\nvery short tasks. Therefore, hardware and software for MTC must be engineered\nto support the additional communication and I/O and must minimize task dispatch\noverheads. The hardware of large-scale HPC systems, with its high degree of\nparallelism and support for intensive communication, is well suited for MTC\napplications. However, HPC systems often lack a dynamic resource-provisioning\nfeature, are not ideal for task communication via the file system, and have an\nI/O system that is not optimized for MTC-style applications. Hence, additional\nsoftware support is likely to be required to gain full benefit from the HPC\nhardware",

        "title": "Optimization and management of microgrids in the built environment based on intelligent digital twins",
        "abstract": "The interplay between the built environment and energy use has profound implications for global energy consumption, emissions, and the transition towards sustainable systems. Recent analyses reveal that buildings are responsible for consuming approximately 40% of global energy, contributing to over 70% of electricity consumption and nearly a third of all carbon emissions. \r\nAs the energy paradigm shifts, so does the dynamic between infrastructure and energy sources. Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), including microgrids, nanogrids, and behind-the-meter energy storage, offer both challenges and opportunities. Additionally, innovations such as grid-interactive efficient buildings and Electric Vehicle (EV) integration pathways (like EV-to-grid and EV-to-home) are broadening the horizons of demand response, heralding an age marked by heightened demand flexibility.\r\nThe past decade's advancements on the Internet of Things (IoT) have opened an era of interconnected sensors and devices. This transition from limited to expansive data repositories facilitates advanced anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, and smart features based on Machine Learning (ML) and other Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered methods. In this scenario, the emergence of the Digital Twin paradigm (DT) is redefining how we model the contexts in which these innovations operate, even though this concept remains under-explored in the energy and smart grid sectors.\r\n\r\nThis research was conducted with the cooperation of ENEA (Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development) and delves into the challenges and potential of integrating AI with Digital Twins to support and enhance energy management and optimization in built environments. Using a testbed at the Faculty of Architecture of Sapienza University of Rome known as the SmartLAB\u2014a building provided with an IoT network, a photovoltaic system, and an EV charging station\u2014the microgrid is monitored and regulated via an AI-driven energy management system (EMS). Through the deployment of IoT devices, vast data streams are generated enabling insights for an Intelligent Digital Twin (IDT) framework built on open-source methods, integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM), IoT, and AI within a Proof of Concept (PoC) Data Ecosystem. The research's core aims are to craft an autonomous system capable of discerning energy loads using Nai\u0308ve Bayes Classifier with Association Rule Mining ensuring efficient energy consumption management and optimized distribution among distinct loads/users. Moreover, it seeks to enhance the well-being of SmartLAB occupants by overseeing CO2 levels, lowering volatile organic compound (VOC) concentrations through IoT-guided, data-informed procedures. This approach demonstrates adaptability across multiple contexts, from grid interactions to smart ecosystems, improving real-time control and providing data-driven energy optimization strategies.\r\nMoreover, the proposed prototype embraces scalable and cross-disciplinary strategies, paving the way for further integrations, such as space management systems and predictive maintenance. The findings highlight the advantages of embracing DT technologies within the built sector, while ongoing advancements are also discussed towards DT-based Smart Cities and Energy Communities for a more sustainable built environment",

        "title": "Location Awareness in Multi-Agent Control of Distributed Energy Resources",
        "abstract": "The  integration  of  Distributed  Energy  Resource  (DER)  technologies  such  as  heat  pumps, electric vehicles and small-scale generation into the electricity grid at the household level is limited by technical constraints.  This work argues that location is an important aspect for the control and integration of DER and that network topology can inferred without the use of a centralised network model.  It addresses DER integration challenges by presenting a novel approach that uses a decentralised multi-agent system where equipment controllers learn and use their location within the low-voltage section of the power system.\n\n\n\nModels of electrical networks exhibiting technical constraints were developed.  Through theoretical analysis and real network data collection, various sources of location data were identified  and  new  geographical  and  electrical  techniques  were  developed  for  deriving  network topology using Global Positioning System (GPS) and 24-hour voltage logs.  The multi-agent system paradigm and societal structures were examined as an approach to a multi-stakeholder domain and congregations were used as an aid to decentralisation in a non-hierarchical, non-market-based  approach.   Through  formal  description  of  the  agent  attitude  INTEND2, the novel  technique  of  Intention  Transfer  was  applied  to  an  agent  congregation  to  provide  an opt-in, collaborative system.\n\n\n\nTest  facilities  for  multi-agent  systems  were  developed  and  culminated  in  a  new  embedded controller test platform that integrated a real-time dynamic electrical network simulator to provide a full-feedback system integrated with control hardware. Finally, a multi-agent control system  was  developed  and  implemented  that  used  location  data  in  providing  demand-side response to a voltage excursion, with the goals of improving power quality, reducing generator disconnections, and deferring network reinforcement.\n\n\n\nThe resulting communicating and self-organising energy agent community, as demonstrated on a unique hardware-in-the-loop platform, provides an application model and test facility to inspire agent-based, location-aware smart grid applications across the power systems domain",

        "abstract": "The quickening propensity of growth within the areas of information and communications technology and energy networks has triggered the emergence of a central idea termed as Internet of Energy (IoE). Such a concept relates the internet of things, which is the term used in describing the usage of sophisticated digital control devices with the capability of transmitting data via IT systems. The concept of an interconnected energy network is being formed in the upcoming days through upgrades in the field of intelligent energy systems to control real-time energy optimization and management. The energy industry has had a sustained expansion, reaching the IoE milestone and continuing to this cutting-edge power system, which is the next generation of IoE. A directional pathway from the traditional power system to the IoE has been conducted in this research work by addressing the importance of integrating the smart transmission and communication infrastructure, smart metering, pricing and energy management scheme. A detailed investigation of the IoE with respect to technical angles, such as communication architecture, IoE on the supply & demand side, and IoE protocol based on fundamental elements and essential technologies has been carried out to indicate the blueprint and jurisdiction complexity. The integration, security and energy management challenges may deviate the performance of the IoE technology that has been focused with proper control issues and solutions. Finally, a directional framework to establish the next-generation IoE system has been constructed with future scopes to insure higher resiliency, cyber-security and stability.Open Access funding is provided by the Qatar National Library",

        "title": "Coordinated scheduling and optimization of networked microgrids in active distribution systems",
        "abstract": "The global shift towards renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, along with the increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), is driving transformative changes in modern power systems. These developments are essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and advancing the transition towards a sustainable energy future. However, the decentralized and intermittent nature of renewable energy, coupled with the growing demand for EV charging, presents significant challenges in maintaining stability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness within active distribution networks. Traditional power systems, designed for centralized and predictable energy generation, struggle to adapt to these changes, necessitating innovative approaches to energy management.\n\nThis thesis develops a comprehensive framework for the coordinated scheduling of networked microgrids, with a focus on the economic and environmental impacts of integrating hydrogen refueling stations and EV charging infrastructure. Microgrids, as localized energy systems that can operate independently or alongside the main grid, offer a promising solution to the challenges of integrating renewable energy. However, managing these microgrids, particularly in the context of EVs and hydrogen refueling stations, requires advanced optimization techniques to ensure that they operate reliably and efficiently while minimizing costs and environmental impacts.\n\nThe proposed framework employs a two-stage stochastic programming approach to optimize microgrid operations under varying conditions. The first stage focuses on defining microgrid service areas, taking into account security constraints during emergency scenarios such as grid outages. The second stage addresses energy management, optimizing the integration of renewable energy sources, EV and fuel cell vehicle (FCV) charging stations, and flexible loads. The goal is to balance operational costs, maximize the use of renewable energy, and reduce emissions.\n\nThe optimization model is implemented using the GUROBI solver within the GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System) environment, enabling efficient computation of complex, multi-objective optimization problems. By balancing economic and environmental objectives, the framework provides a robust solution for managing microgrids under diverse conditions.\n\nTo validate the framework, simulations were conducted using the IEEE 118-bus test system. This well-established benchmark represents a large-scale power grid and allows for rigorous testing of the framework\u2019s performance in real-world scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in both economic and environmental performance. Specifically, the integration of flexible loads and smart EV and FCV charging strategies reduced operating costs by approximately 4.77% and emissions by 49.13%.\n\nThese findings underscore the potential of the proposed framework to contribute to sustainable energy management by providing a scalable approach for optimizing microgrid operations. By promoting economic efficiency and supporting the integration of clean energy technologies, this research aligns with global efforts to decarbonize power systems and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Additionally, the integration of hydrogen refueling stations within microgrids offers new opportunities for energy storage and management, further supporting the transition to a low-carbon transportation sector.\n\nIn conclusion, this thesis makes a significant contribution to sustainable energy management by developing a robust framework for the coordinated scheduling of networked microgrids. The integration of hydrogen refueling and EV charging infrastructure enhances grid flexibility and resilience, while advanced optimization techniques ensure that economic and environmental goals are achieved. Validation of the framework using the IEEE 118-bus test system confirms its applicability to real-world power systems. The findings highlight the critical role of microgrids in the global transition to cleaner, more sustainable energy systems",

        "title": "Topics in Electromobility and Related\n\nApplications",
        "abstract": "In this thesis, we mainly discuss four topics on Electric Vehicles (EVs) in the context of\n\nsmart grid and smart transportation systems.\n\nThe first topic focuses on investigating the impacts of different EV charging strategies on\n\nthe grid. In Chapter 3, we present a mathematical framework for formulating different EV\n\ncharging problems and investigate a range of typical EV charging strategies with respect to\n\ndifferent actors in the power system. Using this framework, we compare the performances of\n\nall charging strategies on a common power system simulation testbed, highlighting in each\n\ncase positive and negative characteristics.\n\nThe second topic is concerned with the applications of EVs with Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)\n\ncapabilities. In Chapter 4, we apply certain ideas from cooperative control techniques to\n\ntwo V2G applications in different scenarios. In the first scenario, we harness the power\n\nof V2G technologies to reduce current imbalance in a three-phase power network. In the\n\nsecond scenario, we design a fair V2G programme to optimally determine the power dispatch\n\nfrom EVs in a microgrid scenario. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms are verified\n\nthrough a variety of simulation studies.\n\nThe third topic discusses an optimal distributed energy management strategy for power\n\ngeneration in a microgrid scenario. In Chapter 5, we adapt the synchronised version of the\n\nAdditive-Increase-Multiplicative-Decrease (AIMD) algorithms to minimise a cost utility\n\nfunction related to the power generation costs of distributed resources. We investigate the\n\nAIMD based strategy through simulation studies and we illustrate that the performance of\n\nthe proposed method is very close to the full communication centralised case. Finally, we\n\nshow that this idea can be easily extended to another application including thermal balancing\n\nrequirements.\n\nThe last topic focuses on a new design of the Speed Advisory System (SAS) for optimising\n\nboth conventional and electric vehicles networks. In Chapter 6, we demonstrate that, by\n\nusing simple ideas, one can design an effective SAS for electric vehicles to minimise group\n\nenergy consumption in a distributed and privacy-aware manner; Matlab simulation are give\n\nto illustrate the effectiveness of this approach. Further, we extend this idea to conventional\n\nvehicles in Chapter 7 and we show that by using some of the ideas introduced in Chapter\n\n6, group emissions of conventional vehicles can also be minimised under the same SAS\n\nframework. SUMO simulation and Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) tests involving real vehicles\n\nare given to illustrate user acceptability and ease of deployment.\n\nFinally, note that many applications in this thesis are based on the theories of a class\n\nof nonlinear iterative feedback systems. For completeness, we present a rigorous proof on\n\nglobal convergence of consensus of such systems in Chapter 2",

        "title": "Assessment The Agricultural Student's Attitudes Towards Organic Farming (Case of Iran)",
        "abstract": "A surveying research was conducted to study and recognize the knowledge and attitude of students toward organic farming at three universities of Iran in 2010. Our consumption patterns and environmental behaviors are rooted in long lived practices and habits. Social norms and values are among the factors that determine what we buy or what we think about organic products. As they are largely unconscious it is difficult to change them. Students are the agriculturist of tomorrow; therefore policies aimed at developing organic farming should address the needs of this group. To discover agriculturist's knowledge organic farming, a survey among 100 agricultural students was conducted. Questionnaire was used to examine students\u2019 knowledge regarding organic farming. Finding is shown that agriculturist's awareness towards organic farming are low, especially in Pests management and Organic product standards aspect. The result of factor analysis showed that nine factors named as concepts, Nutrient safety and security, Organic farming economic, Organic farming extension, Social issue, fertility, Pests management, Environment safety, Organic product standard explained 73.71% of total variance that the first factor accounts for 11.98% of the variance, the second 10.954%, the third 9.191%, the fourth 8.505%, the fifth 8.426%, the sixth 7.536%, the seventh 7.015%, the eighth 5.746% and the ninth 4.364%. In conclusion, to enhance student knowledge about organic farming, it is important that curriculum develops for familiar student with organic farming practices and concepts such as: ecological equilibrium, agro ecosystem sustainability, new technology and indigenous knowledge, nutrition value, human safety, favorite yield production, soil structure improvement, erosion reduces and etc",

        "title": "The toll of the automobile",
        "abstract": "Animal-vehicle collisions are a common phenomenon worldwide, causing injury or death to millions of animals and hundreds of human passengers each year. Collision numbers can be significant to species conservation, wildlife management, traffic safety, as well as from an economic and political point of view, and should thus be evaluated from these different perspectives. In this thesis, I assess, evaluate, analyse and predict animal-vehicle collisions with respect to their extent, their effect on populations, and their broad and fine scale distribution. A questionnaire with Swedish drivers indicated that nationwide road traffic in 1992 may caused an annual loss in harvest of common game species of 7% to 97% and of 1% to 12% of estimated populations. Road mortality did not appear as an existential threat to most species, although in badgers (Meles meles), traffic probably is the largest single cause of death. A slow population growth rate coupled with a high proportion of adult badger road-kills is responsible for their sensitivity to road mortality. Provided that road mortality is additive, we predicted that losses due to nationwide traffic might already exceed birth rates and limit badger population growth. In roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and moose (Alces alces), road mortality is of minor importance to the population. Broad-scale trends and patterns in collision numbers correlate with harvest and traffic volumes, thus providing a simple means to monitor the toll of road traffic. To predict local collision risks with these species, information on animal abundance and landscape composition, on road traffic parameters, and on the spatial coincidence of roads and landscape elements is needed. However, vehicle speed appeared as one of the most important factors determining collision risks with moose, underlining the influence of human factors on collision risks. Successful counteraction therefore requires an interdisciplinary approach that addresses both the animal and the driver in their shared environment",

The ILO\u2019s mandate on disability issues is specified in the ILO Convention 159 (1983) on vocational rehabilitation and employment. No. 159 defines a disabled person as an individual whose prospects of securing, retaining, and advancing in suitable employment are substantially reduced as a result of a duly recognised physical or mental impairment. The Convention established the principle of equal treatment and employment for workers with disabilities",

        "abstract": "Objectives \nTo examine the causes of adverse events\n(AEs) and potential prevention strategies to minimise the\noccurrence of AEs in hospitalised patients.\n\nMethods \nFor the 744 AEs identified in the patient record\nreview study in 21 Dutch hospitals, trained reviewers\nwere asked to select all causal factors that contributed\nto the AE. The results were analysed together with data\non preventability and consequences of AEs. In addition,\nthe reviewers selected one or more prevention strategies\nfor each preventable AE. The recommended prevention\nstrategies were analysed together with four general\ncausal categories: technical, human, organisational and\npatient-related factors.\n\nResults \nHuman causes were predominantly involved in\nthe causation of AEs (in 61% of the AEs), 61% of those\nbeing preventable and 13% leading to permanent\ndisability. In 39% of the AEs, patient-related factors were\ninvolved, in 14% organisational factors and in 4%\ntechnical factors. Organisational causes contributed\nrelatively often to preventable AEs (93%) and AEs\nresulting in permanent disability (20%). Recommended\nstrategies to prevent AEs were quality assurance/peer\nreview, evaluation of safety behaviour, training and\nprocedures. For the AEs with human and patient-related\ncauses, reviewers predominantly recommended quality\nassurance/peer review. AEs caused by organisational\nfactors were considered preventable by improving\nprocedures.\n\nDiscussion \nHealthcare interventions directed at human\ncauses are recommended because these play a large\nrole in AE causation. In addition, it seems worthwhile to\ndirect interventions on organisational causes because the\nAEs they cause are nearly always believed to be\npreventable. Organisational factors are thus relatively\neasy to tackle. Future research designs should allow\nresearchers to interview healthcare providers that were\ninvolved in the event, as an additional source of\ninformation on contributing factors.",

        "abstract": "The last financial crisis combined with some recent social trends (like growing inequality or environmental problems) inspired many contemporary economists to the\r\nre-evaluation of actual economic knowledge in the search for solutions to these\r\nproblems. Modern economic schools (especially heterodox ones) stress the meaning\r\nof ethical issues in economics more often. The thesis of the paper is that this revival\r\nof the ethical face of present economics depends very strongly on the changing assumptions of human nature within economics and other disciplines which work\r\nalongside economics, such as social psychology or business ethics, for instance. In\r\norder to prove the thesis, the paper provides an evaluation of current economic\r\nschools, especially within the heterodoxy, in search of their ethical aspects, and presents them as a result of the changing assumptions about human beings within those\r\nschools. This ethical dimension of human beings manifests itself in different ways,\r\nwhich can be perceived as a result of it being based on different ethical schools and\r\ndifferent psychological and philosophical assumptions about human nature. Therefore, the paper also considers the current developments of the view on human beings\r\nin contemporary schools of economic ethics",

        "abstract": "Current thinking on African conflicts suffers from misinterpretations oversimplification, lack of focus, lack of conceptual clarity, state-centrism and lack of vision). The paper analyses a variety of the dominant explanations of major international actors and donors, showing how these frequently do not distinguish with sufficient clarity between the \u2018root causes\u2019 of a conflict, its aggravating factors and its triggers. Specifically, a correct assessment of conflict prolonging (or sustaining) factors is of vital importance in Africa\u2019s lingering confrontations. Broader approaches (e.g. \u201cstructural stability\u201d) offer a better analytical framework than familiar one-dimensional explanations. Moreover, for explaining and dealing with violent conflicts a shift of attention from the nation-state towards the local and sub-regional level is needed.Aktuelle Analysen afrikanischer Gewaltkonflikte sind h\u00e4ufig voller Fehlinterpretationen (Mangel an Differenzierung, Genauigkeit und konzeptioneller Klarheit, Staatszentriertheit, fehlende mittelfristige Zielvorstellungen). Breitere Ans\u00e4tze (z. B. das Modell der Strukturellen Stabilit\u00e4t) k\u00f6nnten die Grundlage f\u00fcr bessere Analyseraster und Politiken sein als eindimensionale Erkl\u00e4rungen. h\u00e4ufig differenzieren Erkl\u00e4rungsans\u00e4tze nicht mit ausreichender Klarheit zwischen Ursachen, versch\u00e4rfenden und ausl\u00f6senden Faktoren. Insbesondere die richtige Einordnung konfliktverl\u00e4ngernder Faktoren ist in den jahrzehntelangen gewaltsamen Auseinandersetzungen in Afrika von zentraler Bedeutung. Das Diskussionspapier stellt die gro\u00dfe Variationsbreite dominanter Erkl\u00e4rungsmuster der wichtigsten internationalen Geber und Akteure gegen\u00fcber und fordert einen Perspektivenwechsel zum Einbezug der lokalen und der subregionalen Ebene f\u00fcr die Erkl\u00e4rung und Bearbeitung gewaltsamer Konflikte",

        "abstract": "Greater penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in power networks\nrequires coordination strategies that allow for self-adjustment of\ncontributions in a network of DERs, owing to variability in generation and\ndemand. In this article, a distributed scheme is proposed that enables a DER in\na network to arrive at viable power reference commands that satisfies the DERs\nlocal constraints on its generation and loads it has to service, while, the\naggregated behavior of multiple DERs in the network and their respective loads\nmeet the ancillary services demanded by the grid. The Net-load Management\nsystem for a single unit is referred to as the Local Inverter System (LIS) in\nthis article . A distinguishing feature of the proposed consensus based\nsolution is the distributed finite time termination of the algorithm that\nallows each LIS unit in the network to determine power reference commands in\nthe presence of communication delays in a distributed manner. The proposed\nscheme allows prioritization of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in the network\nand also enables auto-adjustment of contributions from LIS units with lower\npriority resources (non-RES). The methods are validated using\nhardware-in-the-loop simulations with Raspberry PI devices as distributed\ncontrol units, implementing the proposed distributed algorithm and responsible\nfor determining and dispatching realtime power reference commands to simulated\npower electronics interface emulating LIS units for demand response.Comment: 7 pages, 11 Figures, IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid\n  Communication",

The methodology consists of the development of seven models: Agent Model, that describes the characteristics of each agent; Task Model, that describes the tasks that the agents carry out; Expertise Model, that describes the knowledge needed by the agents to achieve their goals; Organisation Model, that describes the structural relationships between agents (software agents and/or human agents); Coordination Model, that describes the dynamic relationships between software agents; Communication Model, that describes the dynamic relationships between human agents and their respective personal assistant software agents; and Design Model, that refines the previous models and determines the most suitable agent architecture for each agent, and the requirements of the agent network",

        "abstract": "The construction of a large class of distributed systems can be simplified by leveraging middleware, which is layered between network operating systems and application components. Middleware resolves heterogeneity and facilitates communication and coordination of distributed components. Existing middleware products enable software engineers to build systems that are distributed across a local-area network. State-of-the-art middleware research aims to push this boundary towards Internet-scale distribution, adaptive and reconfigurable middleware and middleware for dependable and wireless systems. The challenge for software engineering research is to devise notations, techniques, methods and tools for distributed system construction that systematically build and exploit the capabilities that middleware deliver",

        "abstract": "We consider wireless communication networks where network users are subject\nto critical events such as emergencies and crises. If a critical event occurs\nto a user, the user needs to send critical traffic as early as possible.\nHowever, most existing medium access control (MAC) protocols are not adequate\nto meet the urgent need for data transmission by users with critical traffic.\nIn this paper, we devise a class of distributed MAC protocols that achieve\ncoordination using the finite-length memory of users containing their own\nobservations and traffic types. We formulate a protocol design problem and find\noptimal protocols that solve the problem. We show that the proposed protocols\nenable a user with critical traffic to transmit its critical traffic without\ninterruption from other users after a short delay while allowing users to share\nthe channel efficiently when there is no critical traffic. Moreover, the\nproposed protocols require short memory and can be implemented without explicit\nmessage passing.Comment: 24 pages, 7 figures, 1 tabl",

        "abstract": "The development of \"smart\" or \"intelligent\" energy networks has been proposed by both EPRI's IntelliGrid initiative and the European SmartGrids Technology Platform as a key step in meeting our future energy needs. A central challenge in delivering the energy networks of the future is the judicious selection and development of an appropriate set of technologies and techniques which will form \"a toolbox of proven technical solutions\". This paper considers functionality required to deliver key parts of the Smart Grid vision of future energy networks. The role of intelligent systems in providing these networks with the requisite decision-making functionality is discussed. In addition to that functionality, the paper considers the role of intelligent systems, in particular multi-agent systems, in providing flexible and extensible architectures for deploying intelligence within the Smart Grid. Beyond exploiting intelligent systems as architectural elements of the Smart Grid, with the purpose of meeting a set of engineering requirements, the role of intelligent systems as a tool for understanding what those requirements are in the first instance, is also briefly discussed",

        "abstract": "Abstract In the recent years, many methodologies and tools to support the energy efficiency re-design of production systems have been developed, however, they do not investigate the real-time manufacturing process. In this paper, a methodology for energy efficiency re-design of production systems in a context of smart manufacturing is proposed. The continuous production-machine data collection with operator feedbacks enables the creation of a knowledge-based repository that provides useful support during the design of manufacturing systems. A case study in an automotive sector company has allowed to implement the methodology and to assess its effectiveness",

        "abstract": "The quantization of optical fields in vacuum has been known for decades, but\nextending the field quantization to lossy and dispersive media in\nnonequilibrium conditions has proven to be complicated due to the\nposition-dependent electric and magnetic responses of the media. In fact,\nconsistent position-dependent quantum models for the photon number in resonant\nstructures have only been formulated very recently and only for dielectric\nmedia. Here we present a general position-dependent quantized fluctuational\nelectrodynamics (QFED) formalism that extends the consistent field quantization\nto describe the photon number also in the presence of magnetic field-matter\ninteractions. It is shown that the magnetic fluctuations provide an additional\ndegree of freedom in media where the magnetic coupling to the field is\nprominent. Therefore, the field quantization requires an additional independent\nnoise operator that is commuting with the conventional bosonic noise operator\ndescribing the polarization current fluctuations in dielectric media. In\naddition to allowing the detailed description of field fluctuations, our\nmethods provide practical tools for modeling optical energy transfer and the\nformation of thermal balance in general dielectric and magnetic nanodevices. We\nuse the QFED to investigate the magnetic properties of microcavity systems to\ndemonstrate an example geometry in which it is possible to probe fields arising\nfrom the electric and magnetic source terms. We show that, as a consequence of\nthe magnetic Purcell effect, the tuning of the position of an emitter layer\nplaced inside a vacuum cavity can make the emissivity of a magnetic emitter to\nexceed the emissivity of a corresponding electric emitter",

        "abstract": "In low-temperature high-density plasmas quantum effects of the electrons are\nbecoming increasingly important. This requires the development of new\ntheoretical and computational tools. Quantum Monte Carlo methods are among the\nmost successful approaches to first-principle simulations of many-body quantum\nsystems. In this chapter we present a recently developed method---the\nconfiguration path integral Monte Carlo (CPIMC) method for moderately coupled,\nhighly degenerate fermions at finite temperatures. It is based on the second\nquantization representation of the $N$-particle density operator in a basis of\n(anti-)symmetrized $N$-particle states (configurations of occupation numbers)\nand allows to tread arbitrary pair interactions in a continuous space.\n  We give a detailed description of the method and discuss the application to\nelectrons or, more generally, Coulomb-interacting fermions. As a test case we\nconsider a few quantum particles in a one-dimensional harmonic trap. Depending\non the coupling parameter (ratio of the interaction energy to kinetic energy),\nthe method strongly reduces the sign problem as compared to direct path\nintegral Monte Carlo (DPIMC) simulations in the regime of strong degeneracy\nwhich is of particular importance for dense matter in laser plasmas or compact\nstars. In order to provide a self-contained introduction, the chapter includes\na short introduction to Metropolis Monte Carlo methods and the second\nquantization of quantum mechanics.Comment: chapter in book \"Introduction to Complex Plasmas: Scientific\n  Challenges and Technological Opportunities\", Michael Bonitz, K.

        "title": "Data-based fault detection in chemical processes: Managing records with operator intervention and uncertain labels",
        "abstract": "Developing data-driven fault detection systems for chemical plants requires managing uncertain data labels and dynamic attributes due to operator-process interactions. Mislabeled data is a known problem in computer science that has received scarce attention from the process systems community. This work introduces and examines the effects of operator actions in records and labels, and the consequences in the development of detection models. Using a state space model, this work proposes an iterative relabeling scheme for retraining classifiers that continuously refines dynamic attributes and labels. Three case studies are presented: a reactor as a motivating example, flooding in a simulated de-Butanizer column, as a complex case, and foaming in an absorber as an industrial challenge. For the first case, detection accuracy is shown to increase by 14% while operating costs are reduced by 20%. Moreover, regarding the de-Butanizer column, the performance of the proposed strategy is shown to be 10% higher than the filtering strategy. Promising results are finally reported in regard of efficient strategies to deal with the presented problemPeer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft",
