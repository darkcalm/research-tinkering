      "title": "A Data-Driven Strategy to Enable Efficient Participation of Diverse Social Classes in Smart Electric Grids",
      "abstract": "abstract: The grand transition of electric grids from conventional fossil fuel resources to intermittent bulk renewable resources and distributed energy resources (DERs) has initiated a paradigm shift in power system operation. Distributed energy resources (i.e. rooftop solar photovoltaic, battery storage, electric vehicles, and demand response), communication infrastructures, and smart measurement devices provide the opportunity for electric utility customers to play an active role in power system operation and even benefit financially from this opportunity. However, new operational challenges have been introduced due to the intrinsic characteristics of DERs such as intermittency of renewable resources, distributed nature of these resources, variety of DERs technologies and human-in-the-loop effect. Demand response (DR) is one of DERs and is highly influenced by human-in-the-loop effect. A data-driven based analysis is implemented to analyze and reveal the customers price responsiveness, and human-in-the-loop effect. The results confirm the critical impact of demographic characteristics of customers on their interaction with smart grid and their quality of service (QoS). The proposed framework is also applicable to other types of DERs. A chance-constraint based second-order-cone programming AC optimal power flow (SOCP-ACOPF) is utilized to dispatch DERs in distribution grid with knowing customers price responsiveness and energy output distribution. The simulation shows that the reliability of distribution gird can be improved by using chance-constraint.Dissertation/ThesisMasters Thesis Electrical Engineering 201",

      "title": "Multi-Agent Decision Support Tool to Enable Interoperability among Heterogeneous Energy Systems",
      "abstract": "Worldwide electricity markets are undergoing a major restructuring process. One of the main reasons for the ongoing changes is to enable the adaptation of current market models to the new paradigm that arises from the large-scale integration of distributed generation sources. In order to deal with the unpredictability caused by the intermittent nature of the distributed generation and the large number of variables that contribute to the energy sector balance, it is extremely important to use simulation systems that are capable of dealing with the required complexity. This paper presents the Tools Control Center (TOOCC), a framework that allows the interoperability between heterogeneous energy and power simulation systems through the use of ontologies, allowing the simulation of scenarios with a high degree of complexity, through the cooperation of the individual capacities of each system. A case study based on real data is presented in order to demonstrate the interoperability capabilities of TOOCC. The simulation considers the energy management of a microgrid of a real university campus, from the perspective of the network manager and also of its consumers/producers, in a projection for a typical day of the winter of 2050.This work has been developed in the scope of the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 641794 (project DREAM-GO); CONTEST project - SAICT-POL/23575/2016; and has also been supported by FEDER Funds through COMPETE program and from National Funds through FCT under the project UID/EEA/00760/2013.info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio",

      "abstract": "In the push to develop smart energy systems, designers have increasingly focused on systems that measure and predict user behavior to effect optimal energy consumption. While such focus is an important component in these systems' success, designers have paid substantially less attention to the people on the other side of the energy system loop-the supervisors of power generation processes. Smart energy systems that leverage pervasive computing could add to these supervisory control operators' workload. They'll have to predict possible power plant load and production changes caused by environmental and plant events, as well as dynamic system adaptation in response to consumer behaviors. Contrary to many assumptions, inserting more automation, including distributed sensors and algorithms to postprocess data, won't necessarily reduce operators' workload or improve system performance",

Distributed energy resources (i.e. rooftop solar photovoltaic, battery storage, electric vehicles, and demand response), communication infrastructures, and smart measurement devices provide the opportunity for electric utility customers to play an active role in power system operation and even benefit financially from this opportunity. However, new operational challenges have been introduced due to the intrinsic characteristics of DERs such as intermittency of renewable resources, distributed nature of these resources, variety of DERs technologies and human-in-the-loop effect.

      "abstract": "In the push to develop smart energy systems, designers have increasingly focused on systems that measure and predict user behavior to effect optimal energy consumption. While such focus is an important component in these systems' success, designers have paid substantially less attention to the people on the other side of the energy system loop-the supervisors of power generation processes. Smart energy systems that leverage pervasive computing could add to these supervisory control operators' workload. They'll have to predict possible power plant load and production changes caused by environmental and plant events, as well as dynamic system adaptation in response to consumer behaviors. Contrary to many assumptions, inserting more automation, including distributed sensors and algorithms to postprocess data, won't necessarily reduce operators' workload or improve system performance",

      "abstract": "Internet-of-Things (IoT) envisions an intelligent infrastructure of networked\nsmart devices offering task-specific monitoring and control services. The\nunique features of IoT include extreme heterogeneity, massive number of\ndevices, and unpredictable dynamics partially due to human interaction. These\ncall for foundational innovations in network design and management. Ideally, it\nshould allow efficient adaptation to changing environments, and low-cost\nimplementation scalable to massive number of devices, subject to stringent\nlatency constraints. To this end, the overarching goal of this paper is to\noutline a unified framework for online learning and management policies in IoT\nthrough joint advances in communication, networking, learning, and\noptimization. From the network architecture vantage point, the unified\nframework leverages a promising fog architecture that enables smart devices to\nhave proximity access to cloud functionalities at the network edge, along the\ncloud-to-things continuum. From the algorithmic perspective, key innovations\ntarget online approaches adaptive to different degrees of nonstationarity in\nIoT dynamics, and their scalable model-free implementation under limited\nfeedback that motivates blind or bandit approaches. The proposed framework\naspires to offer a stepping stone that leads to systematic designs and analysis\nof task-specific learning and management schemes for IoT, along with a host of\nnew research directions to build on.Comment: Submitted on June 15 to Proceeding of IEEE Special Issue on Adaptive\n  and Scalable Communication Network",

      "abstract": "The effort to continuously improve and innovate smart appliances (SA) energy management requires an experimental research and development environment which integrates widely differing tools and resources seamlessly. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Direct Load Control (DLC) testbed, aiming to conveniently support the research community, as well as analyzing and comparing their designs in a laboratory environment. Based on the LabVIEW computing platform, this original testbed enables access to knowledge of major components such as online weather forecasting information, distributed energy resources (e.g., energy storage, solar photovoltaic), dynamic electricity tariff from utilities and demand response (DR) providers together with different mathematical optimization features given by General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS). This intercommunication is possible thanks to the different applications programming interfaces (API) incorporated into the system and to intermediate agents specially developed for this case. Different basic case studies have been presented to envision the possibilities of this system in the future and more complex scenarios, to actively support the DLC strategies. These measures will offer enough flexibility to minimize the impact on user comfort combined with support for multiple DR programs. Thus, given the successful results, this platform can lead to a solution towards more efficient use of energy in the residential environment",

      "abstract": "Internet-of-Things (IoT) envisions an intelligent infrastructure of networked\nsmart devices offering task-specific monitoring and control services. The\nunique features of IoT include extreme heterogeneity, massive number of\ndevices, and unpredictable dynamics partially due to human interaction. These\ncall for foundational innovations in network design and management. Ideally, it\nshould allow efficient adaptation to changing environments, and low-cost\nimplementation scalable to massive number of devices, subject to stringent\nlatency constraints. To this end, the overarching goal of this paper is to\noutline a unified framework for online learning and management policies in IoT\nthrough joint advances in communication, networking, learning, and\noptimization. From the network architecture vantage point, the unified\nframework leverages a promising fog architecture that enables smart devices to\nhave proximity access to cloud functionalities at the network edge, along the\ncloud-to-things continuum. From the algorithmic perspective, key innovations\ntarget online approaches adaptive to different degrees of nonstationarity in\nIoT dynamics, and their scalable model-free implementation under limited\nfeedback that motivates blind or bandit approaches. The proposed framework\naspires to offer a stepping stone that leads to systematic designs and analysis\nof task-specific learning and management schemes for IoT, along with a host of\nnew research directions to build on.Comment: Submitted on June 15 to Proceeding of IEEE Special Issue on Adaptive\n  and Scalable Communication Network",

      "abstract": "The effort to continuously improve and innovate smart appliances (SA) energy management requires an experimental research and development environment which integrates widely differing tools and resources seamlessly. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Direct Load Control (DLC) testbed, aiming to conveniently support the research community, as well as analyzing and comparing their designs in a laboratory environment. Based on the LabVIEW computing platform, this original testbed enables access to knowledge of major components such as online weather forecasting information, distributed energy resources (e.g., energy storage, solar photovoltaic), dynamic electricity tariff from utilities and demand response (DR) providers together with different mathematical optimization features given by General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS). This intercommunication is possible thanks to the different applications programming interfaces (API) incorporated into the system and to intermediate agents specially developed for this case. Different basic case studies have been presented to envision the possibilities of this system in the future and more complex scenarios, to actively support the DLC strategies. These measures will offer enough flexibility to minimize the impact on user comfort combined with support for multiple DR programs. Thus, given the successful results, this platform can lead to a solution towards more efficient use of energy in the residential environment",

      "title": "A Data-Driven Strategy to Enable Efficient Participation of Diverse Social Classes in Smart Electric Grids",
      "abstract": "abstract: The grand transition of electric grids from conventional fossil fuel resources to intermittent bulk renewable resources and distributed energy resources (DERs) has initiated a paradigm shift in power system operation. Distributed energy resources (i.e. rooftop solar photovoltaic, battery storage, electric vehicles, and demand response), communication infrastructures, and smart measurement devices provide the opportunity for electric utility customers to play an active role in power system operation and even benefit financially from this opportunity. However, new operational challenges have been introduced due to the intrinsic characteristics of DERs such as intermittency of renewable resources, distributed nature of these resources, variety of DERs technologies and human-in-the-loop effect. Demand response (DR) is one of DERs and is highly influenced by human-in-the-loop effect. A data-driven based analysis is implemented to analyze and reveal the customers price responsiveness, and human-in-the-loop effect. The results confirm the critical impact of demographic characteristics of customers on their interaction with smart grid and their quality of service (QoS). The proposed framework is also applicable to other types of DERs. A chance-constraint based second-order-cone programming AC optimal power flow (SOCP-ACOPF) is utilized to dispatch DERs in distribution grid with knowing customers price responsiveness and energy output distribution. The simulation shows that the reliability of distribution gird can be improved by using chance-constraint.Dissertation/ThesisMasters Thesis Electrical Engineering 201",

      "title": "Multi-Agent Decision Support Tool to Enable Interoperability among Heterogeneous Energy Systems",
      "abstract": "Worldwide electricity markets are undergoing a major restructuring process. One of the main reasons for the ongoing changes is to enable the adaptation of current market models to the new paradigm that arises from the large-scale integration of distributed generation sources. In order to deal with the unpredictability caused by the intermittent nature of the distributed generation and the large number of variables that contribute to the energy sector balance, it is extremely important to use simulation systems that are capable of dealing with the required complexity. This paper presents the Tools Control Center (TOOCC), a framework that allows the interoperability between heterogeneous energy and power simulation systems through the use of ontologies, allowing the simulation of scenarios with a high degree of complexity, through the cooperation of the individual capacities of each system. A case study based on real data is presented in order to demonstrate the interoperability capabilities of TOOCC. The simulation considers the energy management of a microgrid of a real university campus, from the perspective of the network manager and also of its consumers/producers, in a projection for a typical day of the winter of 2050.This work has been developed in the scope of the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 641794 (project DREAM-GO); CONTEST project - SAICT-POL/23575/2016; and has also been supported by FEDER Funds through COMPETE program and from National Funds through FCT under the project UID/EEA/00760/2013.info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio",
