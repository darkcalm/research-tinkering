      "title": "Assessment The Agricultural Student's Attitudes Towards Organic Farming (Case of Iran)",
      "abstract": "A surveying research was conducted to study and recognize the knowledge and attitude of students toward organic farming at three universities of Iran in 2010. Our consumption patterns and environmental behaviors are rooted in long lived practices and habits. Social norms and values are among the factors that determine what we buy or what we think about organic products. As they are largely unconscious it is difficult to change them. Students are the agriculturist of tomorrow; therefore policies aimed at developing organic farming should address the needs of this group. To discover agriculturist's knowledge organic farming, a survey among 100 agricultural students was conducted. Questionnaire was used to examine students\u2019 knowledge regarding organic farming. Finding is shown that agriculturist's awareness towards organic farming are low, especially in Pests management and Organic product standards aspect. The result of factor analysis showed that nine factors named as concepts, Nutrient safety and security, Organic farming economic, Organic farming extension, Social issue, fertility, Pests management, Environment safety, Organic product standard explained 73.71% of total variance that the first factor accounts for 11.98% of the variance, the second 10.954%, the third 9.191%, the fourth 8.505%, the fifth 8.426%, the sixth 7.536%, the seventh 7.015%, the eighth 5.746% and the ninth 4.364%. In conclusion, to enhance student knowledge about organic farming, it is important that curriculum develops for familiar student with organic farming practices and concepts such as: ecological equilibrium, agro ecosystem sustainability, new technology and indigenous knowledge, nutrition value, human safety, favorite yield production, soil structure improvement, erosion reduces and etc",

      "title": "The toll of the automobile",
      "abstract": "Animal-vehicle collisions are a common phenomenon worldwide, causing injury or death to millions of animals and hundreds of human passengers each year. Collision numbers can be significant to species conservation, wildlife management, traffic safety, as well as from an economic and political point of view, and should thus be evaluated from these different perspectives. In this thesis, I assess, evaluate, analyse and predict animal-vehicle collisions with respect to their extent, their effect on populations, and their broad and fine scale distribution. A questionnaire with Swedish drivers indicated that nationwide road traffic in 1992 may caused an annual loss in harvest of common game species of 7% to 97% and of 1% to 12% of estimated populations. Road mortality did not appear as an existential threat to most species, although in badgers (Meles meles), traffic probably is the largest single cause of death. A slow population growth rate coupled with a high proportion of adult badger road-kills is responsible for their sensitivity to road mortality. Provided that road mortality is additive, we predicted that losses due to nationwide traffic might already exceed birth rates and limit badger population growth. In roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and moose (Alces alces), road mortality is of minor importance to the population. Broad-scale trends and patterns in collision numbers correlate with harvest and traffic volumes, thus providing a simple means to monitor the toll of road traffic. To predict local collision risks with these species, information on animal abundance and landscape composition, on road traffic parameters, and on the spatial coincidence of roads and landscape elements is needed. However, vehicle speed appeared as one of the most important factors determining collision risks with moose, underlining the influence of human factors on collision risks. Successful counteraction therefore requires an interdisciplinary approach that addresses both the animal and the driver in their shared environment",

The ILO\u2019s mandate on disability issues is specified in the ILO Convention 159 (1983) on vocational rehabilitation and employment.

      "abstract": "Objectives \nTo examine the causes of adverse events\n(AEs) and potential prevention strategies to minimise the\noccurrence of AEs in hospitalised patients.\n\nMethods \nFor the 744 AEs identified in the patient record\nreview study in 21 Dutch hospitals, trained reviewers\nwere asked to select all causal factors that contributed\nto the AE. The results were analysed together with data\non preventability and consequences of AEs. In addition,\nthe reviewers selected one or more prevention strategies\nfor each preventable AE. The recommended prevention\nstrategies were analysed together with four general\ncausal categories: technical, human, organisational and\npatient-related factors.\n\nResults \nHuman causes were predominantly involved in\nthe causation of AEs (in 61% of the AEs), 61% of those\nbeing preventable and 13% leading to permanent\ndisability. In 39% of the AEs, patient-related factors were\ninvolved, in 14% organisational factors and in 4%\ntechnical factors. Organisational causes contributed\nrelatively often to preventable AEs (93%) and AEs\nresulting in permanent disability (20%). Recommended\nstrategies to prevent AEs were quality assurance/peer\nreview, evaluation of safety behaviour, training and\nprocedures. For the AEs with human and patient-related\ncauses, reviewers predominantly recommended quality\nassurance/peer review. AEs caused by organisational\nfactors were considered preventable by improving\nprocedures.\n\nDiscussion \nHealthcare interventions directed at human\ncauses are recommended because these play a large\nrole in AE causation. In addition, it seems worthwhile to\ndirect interventions on organisational causes because the\nAEs they cause are nearly always believed to be\npreventable. Organisational factors are thus relatively\neasy to tackle. Future research designs should allow\nresearchers to interview healthcare providers that were\ninvolved in the event, as an additional source of\ninformation on contributing factors.",

      "abstract": "The last financial crisis combined with some recent social trends (like growing inequality or environmental problems) inspired many contemporary economists to the\r\nre-evaluation of actual economic knowledge in the search for solutions to these\r\nproblems. Modern economic schools (especially heterodox ones) stress the meaning\r\nof ethical issues in economics more often. The thesis of the paper is that this revival\r\nof the ethical face of present economics depends very strongly on the changing assumptions of human nature within economics and other disciplines which work\r\nalongside economics, such as social psychology or business ethics, for instance. In\r\norder to prove the thesis, the paper provides an evaluation of current economic\r\nschools, especially within the heterodoxy, in search of their ethical aspects, and presents them as a result of the changing assumptions about human beings within those\r\nschools. This ethical dimension of human beings manifests itself in different ways,\r\nwhich can be perceived as a result of it being based on different ethical schools and\r\ndifferent psychological and philosophical assumptions about human nature. Therefore, the paper also considers the current developments of the view on human beings\r\nin contemporary schools of economic ethics",

      "abstract": "Current thinking on African conflicts suffers from misinterpretations oversimplification, lack of focus, lack of conceptual clarity, state-centrism and lack of vision). The paper analyses a variety of the dominant explanations of major international actors and donors, showing how these frequently do not distinguish with sufficient clarity between the \u2018root causes\u2019 of a conflict, its aggravating factors and its triggers. Specifically, a correct assessment of conflict prolonging (or sustaining) factors is of vital importance in Africa\u2019s lingering confrontations. Broader approaches (e.g. \u201cstructural stability\u201d) offer a better analytical framework than familiar one-dimensional explanations. Moreover, for explaining and dealing with violent conflicts a shift of attention from the nation-state towards the local and sub-regional level is needed.Aktuelle Analysen afrikanischer Gewaltkonflikte sind h\u00e4ufig voller Fehlinterpretationen (Mangel an Differenzierung, Genauigkeit und konzeptioneller Klarheit, Staatszentriertheit, fehlende mittelfristige Zielvorstellungen). Breitere Ans\u00e4tze (z. B. das Modell der Strukturellen Stabilit\u00e4t) k\u00f6nnten die Grundlage f\u00fcr bessere Analyseraster und Politiken sein als eindimensionale Erkl\u00e4rungen. h\u00e4ufig differenzieren Erkl\u00e4rungsans\u00e4tze nicht mit ausreichender Klarheit zwischen Ursachen, versch\u00e4rfenden und ausl\u00f6senden Faktoren.

      "title": "Assessment The Agricultural Student's Attitudes Towards Organic Farming (Case of Iran)",
      "abstract": "A surveying research was conducted to study and recognize the knowledge and attitude of students toward organic farming at three universities of Iran in 2010. Our consumption patterns and environmental behaviors are rooted in long lived practices and habits. Social norms and values are among the factors that determine what we buy or what we think about organic products. As they are largely unconscious it is difficult to change them. Students are the agriculturist of tomorrow; therefore policies aimed at developing organic farming should address the needs of this group. To discover agriculturist's knowledge organic farming, a survey among 100 agricultural students was conducted. Questionnaire was used to examine students\u2019 knowledge regarding organic farming. Finding is shown that agriculturist's awareness towards organic farming are low, especially in Pests management and Organic product standards aspect. The result of factor analysis showed that nine factors named as concepts, Nutrient safety and security, Organic farming economic, Organic farming extension, Social issue, fertility, Pests management, Environment safety, Organic product standard explained 73.71% of total variance that the first factor accounts for 11.98% of the variance, the second 10.954%, the third 9.191%, the fourth 8.505%, the fifth 8.426%, the sixth 7.536%, the seventh 7.015%, the eighth 5.746% and the ninth 4.364%. In conclusion, to enhance student knowledge about organic farming, it is important that curriculum develops for familiar student with organic farming practices and concepts such as: ecological equilibrium, agro ecosystem sustainability, new technology and indigenous knowledge, nutrition value, human safety, favorite yield production, soil structure improvement, erosion reduces and etc",

      "title": "The toll of the automobile",
      "abstract": "Animal-vehicle collisions are a common phenomenon worldwide, causing injury or death to millions of animals and hundreds of human passengers each year. Collision numbers can be significant to species conservation, wildlife management, traffic safety, as well as from an economic and political point of view, and should thus be evaluated from these different perspectives. In this thesis, I assess, evaluate, analyse and predict animal-vehicle collisions with respect to their extent, their effect on populations, and their broad and fine scale distribution. A questionnaire with Swedish drivers indicated that nationwide road traffic in 1992 may caused an annual loss in harvest of common game species of 7% to 97% and of 1% to 12% of estimated populations. Road mortality did not appear as an existential threat to most species, although in badgers (Meles meles), traffic probably is the largest single cause of death. A slow population growth rate coupled with a high proportion of adult badger road-kills is responsible for their sensitivity to road mortality. Provided that road mortality is additive, we predicted that losses due to nationwide traffic might already exceed birth rates and limit badger population growth. In roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and moose (Alces alces), road mortality is of minor importance to the population. Broad-scale trends and patterns in collision numbers correlate with harvest and traffic volumes, thus providing a simple means to monitor the toll of road traffic. To predict local collision risks with these species, information on animal abundance and landscape composition, on road traffic parameters, and on the spatial coincidence of roads and landscape elements is needed. However, vehicle speed appeared as one of the most important factors determining collision risks with moose, underlining the influence of human factors on collision risks. Successful counteraction therefore requires an interdisciplinary approach that addresses both the animal and the driver in their shared environment",

The ILO\u2019s mandate on disability issues is specified in the ILO Convention 159 (1983) on vocational rehabilitation and employment. No. 159 defines a disabled person as an individual whose prospects of securing, retaining, and advancing in suitable employment are substantially reduced as a result of a duly recognised physical or mental impairment. The Convention established the principle of equal treatment and employment for workers with disabilities",

      "abstract": "Objectives \nTo examine the causes of adverse events\n(AEs) and potential prevention strategies to minimise the\noccurrence of AEs in hospitalised patients.\n\nMethods \nFor the 744 AEs identified in the patient record\nreview study in 21 Dutch hospitals, trained reviewers\nwere asked to select all causal factors that contributed\nto the AE. The results were analysed together with data\non preventability and consequences of AEs. In addition,\nthe reviewers selected one or more prevention strategies\nfor each preventable AE. The recommended prevention\nstrategies were analysed together with four general\ncausal categories: technical, human, organisational and\npatient-related factors.\n\nResults \nHuman causes were predominantly involved in\nthe causation of AEs (in 61% of the AEs), 61% of those\nbeing preventable and 13% leading to permanent\ndisability. In 39% of the AEs, patient-related factors were\ninvolved, in 14% organisational factors and in 4%\ntechnical factors. Organisational causes contributed\nrelatively often to preventable AEs (93%) and AEs\nresulting in permanent disability (20%). Recommended\nstrategies to prevent AEs were quality assurance/peer\nreview, evaluation of safety behaviour, training and\nprocedures. For the AEs with human and patient-related\ncauses, reviewers predominantly recommended quality\nassurance/peer review. AEs caused by organisational\nfactors were considered preventable by improving\nprocedures.\n\nDiscussion \nHealthcare interventions directed at human\ncauses are recommended because these play a large\nrole in AE causation. In addition, it seems worthwhile to\ndirect interventions on organisational causes because the\nAEs they cause are nearly always believed to be\npreventable. Organisational factors are thus relatively\neasy to tackle.

      "title": "The Changing Face of Economics? Ethical Issues in Contemporary Economic Schools as a Consequence of Changes in the Concept of Human Nature",
      "abstract": "The last financial crisis combined with some recent social trends (like growing inequality or environmental problems) inspired many contemporary economists to the\r\nre-evaluation of actual economic knowledge in the search for solutions to these\r\nproblems. Modern economic schools (especially heterodox ones) stress the meaning\r\nof ethical issues in economics more often. The thesis of the paper is that this revival\r\nof the ethical face of present economics depends very strongly on the changing assumptions of human nature within economics and other disciplines which work\r\nalongside economics, such as social psychology or business ethics, for instance. In\r\norder to prove the thesis, the paper provides an evaluation of current economic\r\nschools, especially within the heterodoxy, in search of their ethical aspects, and presents them as a result of the changing assumptions about human beings within those\r\nschools. This ethical dimension of human beings manifests itself in different ways,\r\nwhich can be perceived as a result of it being based on different ethical schools and\r\ndifferent psychological and philosophical assumptions about human nature. Therefore, the paper also considers the current developments of the view on human beings\r\nin contemporary schools of economic ethics",

      "title": "Major flaws in conflict prevention policies towards Africa : the conceptual deficits of international actors\u2019 approaches and how to overcome them",
      "abstract": "Current thinking on African conflicts suffers from misinterpretations oversimplification, lack of focus, lack of conceptual clarity, state-centrism and lack of vision). The paper analyses a variety of the dominant explanations of major international actors and donors, showing how these frequently do not distinguish with sufficient clarity between the \u2018root causes\u2019 of a conflict, its aggravating factors and its triggers. Specifically, a correct assessment of conflict prolonging (or sustaining) factors is of vital importance in Africa\u2019s lingering confrontations. Broader approaches (e.g. \u201cstructural stability\u201d) offer a better analytical framework than familiar one-dimensional explanations. Moreover, for explaining and dealing with violent conflicts a shift of attention from the nation-state towards the local and sub-regional level is needed.Aktuelle Analysen afrikanischer Gewaltkonflikte sind h\u00e4ufig voller Fehlinterpretationen (Mangel an Differenzierung, Genauigkeit und konzeptioneller Klarheit, Staatszentriertheit, fehlende mittelfristige Zielvorstellungen). Breitere Ans\u00e4tze (z. B. das Modell der Strukturellen Stabilit\u00e4t) k\u00f6nnten die Grundlage f\u00fcr bessere Analyseraster und Politiken sein als eindimensionale Erkl\u00e4rungen. h\u00e4ufig differenzieren Erkl\u00e4rungsans\u00e4tze nicht mit ausreichender Klarheit zwischen Ursachen, versch\u00e4rfenden und ausl\u00f6senden Faktoren. Insbesondere die richtige Einordnung konfliktverl\u00e4ngernder Faktoren ist in den jahrzehntelangen gewaltsamen Auseinandersetzungen in Afrika von zentraler Bedeutung. Das Diskussionspapier stellt die gro\u00dfe Variationsbreite dominanter Erkl\u00e4rungsmuster der wichtigsten internationalen Geber und Akteure gegen\u00fcber und fordert einen Perspektivenwechsel zum Einbezug der lokalen und der subregionalen Ebene f\u00fcr die Erkl\u00e4rung und Bearbeitung gewaltsamer Konflikte",

      "title": "Assessment The Agricultural Student's Attitudes Towards Organic Farming (Case of Iran)",
      "abstract": "A surveying research was conducted to study and recognize the knowledge and attitude of students toward organic farming at three universities of Iran in 2010. Our consumption patterns and environmental behaviors are rooted in long lived practices and habits. Social norms and values are among the factors that determine what we buy or what we think about organic products. As they are largely unconscious it is difficult to change them. Students are the agriculturist of tomorrow; therefore policies aimed at developing organic farming should address the needs of this group. To discover agriculturist's knowledge organic farming, a survey among 100 agricultural students was conducted. Questionnaire was used to examine students\u2019 knowledge regarding organic farming. Finding is shown that agriculturist's awareness towards organic farming are low, especially in Pests management and Organic product standards aspect. The result of factor analysis showed that nine factors named as concepts, Nutrient safety and security, Organic farming economic, Organic farming extension, Social issue, fertility, Pests management, Environment safety, Organic product standard explained 73.71% of total variance that the first factor accounts for 11.98% of the variance, the second 10.954%, the third 9.191%, the fourth 8.505%, the fifth 8.426%, the sixth 7.536%, the seventh 7.015%, the eighth 5.746% and the ninth 4.364%. In conclusion, to enhance student knowledge about organic farming, it is important that curriculum develops for familiar student with organic farming practices and concepts such as: ecological equilibrium, agro ecosystem sustainability, new technology and indigenous knowledge, nutrition value, human safety, favorite yield production, soil structure improvement, erosion reduces and etc",

      "title": "The toll of the automobile",
      "abstract": "Animal-vehicle collisions are a common phenomenon worldwide, causing injury or death to millions of animals and hundreds of human passengers each year. Collision numbers can be significant to species conservation, wildlife management, traffic safety, as well as from an economic and political point of view, and should thus be evaluated from these different perspectives. In this thesis, I assess, evaluate, analyse and predict animal-vehicle collisions with respect to their extent, their effect on populations, and their broad and fine scale distribution. A questionnaire with Swedish drivers indicated that nationwide road traffic in 1992 may caused an annual loss in harvest of common game species of 7% to 97% and of 1% to 12% of estimated populations. Road mortality did not appear as an existential threat to most species, although in badgers (Meles meles), traffic probably is the largest single cause of death. A slow population growth rate coupled with a high proportion of adult badger road-kills is responsible for their sensitivity to road mortality. Provided that road mortality is additive, we predicted that losses due to nationwide traffic might already exceed birth rates and limit badger population growth. In roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and moose (Alces alces), road mortality is of minor importance to the population. Broad-scale trends and patterns in collision numbers correlate with harvest and traffic volumes, thus providing a simple means to monitor the toll of road traffic. To predict local collision risks with these species, information on animal abundance and landscape composition, on road traffic parameters, and on the spatial coincidence of roads and landscape elements is needed. However, vehicle speed appeared as one of the most important factors determining collision risks with moose, underlining the influence of human factors on collision risks. Successful counteraction therefore requires an interdisciplinary approach that addresses both the animal and the driver in their shared environment",

      "abstract": "Objectives \nTo examine the causes of adverse events\n(AEs) and potential prevention strategies to minimise the\noccurrence of AEs in hospitalised patients.\n\nMethods \nFor the 744 AEs identified in the patient record\nreview study in 21 Dutch hospitals, trained reviewers\nwere asked to select all causal factors that contributed\nto the AE. The results were analysed together with data\non preventability and consequences of AEs. In addition,\nthe reviewers selected one or more prevention strategies\nfor each preventable AE. The recommended prevention\nstrategies were analysed together with four general\ncausal categories: technical, human, organisational and\npatient-related factors.\n\nResults \nHuman causes were predominantly involved in\nthe causation of AEs (in 61% of the AEs), 61% of those\nbeing preventable and 13% leading to permanent\ndisability. In 39% of the AEs, patient-related factors were\ninvolved, in 14% organisational factors and in 4%\ntechnical factors. Organisational causes contributed\nrelatively often to preventable AEs (93%) and AEs\nresulting in permanent disability (20%). Recommended\nstrategies to prevent AEs were quality assurance/peer\nreview, evaluation of safety behaviour, training and\nprocedures. For the AEs with human and patient-related\ncauses, reviewers predominantly recommended quality\nassurance/peer review. AEs caused by organisational\nfactors were considered preventable by improving\nprocedures.\n\nDiscussion \nHealthcare interventions directed at human\ncauses are recommended because these play a large\nrole in AE causation. In addition, it seems worthwhile to\ndirect interventions on organisational causes because the\nAEs they cause are nearly always believed to be\npreventable. Organisational factors are thus relatively\neasy to tackle. Future research designs should allow\nresearchers to interview healthcare providers that were\ninvolved in the event, as an additional source of\ninformation on contributing factors.",

      "abstract": "The last financial crisis combined with some recent social trends (like growing inequality or environmental problems) inspired many contemporary economists to the\r\nre-evaluation of actual economic knowledge in the search for solutions to these\r\nproblems. Modern economic schools (especially heterodox ones) stress the meaning\r\nof ethical issues in economics more often. The thesis of the paper is that this revival\r\nof the ethical face of present economics depends very strongly on the changing assumptions of human nature within economics and other disciplines which work\r\nalongside economics, such as social psychology or business ethics, for instance. In\r\norder to prove the thesis, the paper provides an evaluation of current economic\r\nschools, especially within the heterodoxy, in search of their ethical aspects, and presents them as a result of the changing assumptions about human beings within those\r\nschools. This ethical dimension of human beings manifests itself in different ways,\r\nwhich can be perceived as a result of it being based on different ethical schools and\r\ndifferent psychological and philosophical assumptions about human nature. Therefore, the paper also considers the current developments of the view on human beings\r\nin contemporary schools of economic ethics",

      "abstract": "Current thinking on African conflicts suffers from misinterpretations oversimplification, lack of focus, lack of conceptual clarity, state-centrism and lack of vision). The paper analyses a variety of the dominant explanations of major international actors and donors, showing how these frequently do not distinguish with sufficient clarity between the \u2018root causes\u2019 of a conflict, its aggravating factors and its triggers. Specifically, a correct assessment of conflict prolonging (or sustaining) factors is of vital importance in Africa\u2019s lingering confrontations. Broader approaches (e.g. \u201cstructural stability\u201d) offer a better analytical framework than familiar one-dimensional explanations. Moreover, for explaining and dealing with violent conflicts a shift of attention from the nation-state towards the local and sub-regional level is needed.Aktuelle Analysen afrikanischer Gewaltkonflikte sind h\u00e4ufig voller Fehlinterpretationen (Mangel an Differenzierung, Genauigkeit und konzeptioneller Klarheit, Staatszentriertheit, fehlende mittelfristige Zielvorstellungen). Breitere Ans\u00e4tze (z. B. das Modell der Strukturellen Stabilit\u00e4t) k\u00f6nnten die Grundlage f\u00fcr bessere Analyseraster und Politiken sein als eindimensionale Erkl\u00e4rungen. h\u00e4ufig differenzieren Erkl\u00e4rungsans\u00e4tze nicht mit ausreichender Klarheit zwischen Ursachen, versch\u00e4rfenden und ausl\u00f6senden Faktoren. Insbesondere die richtige Einordnung konfliktverl\u00e4ngernder Faktoren ist in den jahrzehntelangen gewaltsamen Auseinandersetzungen in Afrika von zentraler Bedeutung. Das Diskussionspapier stellt die gro\u00dfe Variationsbreite dominanter Erkl\u00e4rungsmuster der wichtigsten internationalen Geber und Akteure gegen\u00fcber und fordert einen Perspektivenwechsel zum Einbezug der lokalen und der subregionalen Ebene f\u00fcr die Erkl\u00e4rung und Bearbeitung gewaltsamer Konflikte",
