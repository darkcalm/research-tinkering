This 18 \ndichotomisation into fertile versus infertile, based on lack of conception over 12 month period, is 19 \nfundamentally flawed. Time to conception is strongly influenced by factors such as female age and 20 \nwhilst a minority of couples have absolute infertility (sterility), many are able to conceive without 21 \nintervention but may take longer to do so, reflecting the degree of subfertility. This natural 22 \nvariability in time to conception means that subfertility reflects a prognosis rather than a diagnosis. 23 \nCurrent clinical prediction models in fertility only provide individualised estimates of the probability 24 \nof either treatment independent pregnancy or treatment dependent pregnancy, but do not take 25 \naccount of both.  Together, prognostic factors which are able to predict natural pregnancy and 26 \npredictive factors of response to treatment would be required to estimate the absolute increase in 27 \npregnancy chances with treatment. This stratified medicine approach would be appropriate for 28 \nfacilitating personalised decision-making concerning whether or not to treat subfertile patients.  29 \nPublished models are thus far of little value for decisions regarding when to initiate treatment in 30 \npatients who undergo a period of, ultimately unsuccessful, expectant management. We submit that 31 \na dynamic prediction approach, which estimates the change in subfertility prognosis over the course 32 \nof follow-up, would be ideally suited to inform when the commencement of treatment would be 33 \nmost beneficial in those undergoing expectant management. Further research needs to be 34 \nundertaken to identify treatment predictive factors and to identify or create databases to allow 35 \nthese approaches to be explored. In the interim, the most feasible approach is to use a combination 36 \nof previously published clinical prediction models.  37 \n \n \n3 \n \nIntroduction   38 \nInfertility is defined as \u201ca disease of the reproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a 39 \nclinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse\u201d according to 40 \nthe World Health Organisation (WHO) and International Committee for Monitoring Assisted 41 \nReproductive Technology (ICMART) (Zegers-Hochschild et al., 2009). Absence of pregnancy within 42 \nthis time-period is interpreted as evidence of sterility by many couples, who then request immediate 43 \ntreatment. 44 \nIn fact, the probability of conceiving is highly variable (te Velde et al. 2000) and genuine unresolved 45 \ninfertility or sterility, occurs in a minority (3\u20135%) of all couples (Greenhall and Vessey 1990). 41TAs 46 \ncouples who are more \u201cfertile\u201d41T tend to conceive early, the length of time couples have been 47 \nunsuccessful at conceiving reflects the degree of subfertility. The term \u201cinfertility\u201d is often used 48 \ninterchangeably with \u201csubfertility\u201d ((Gnoth et al. 2005, Gurunath et al. 2011, Habbema et al. 2004)). 49 \nHowever, in this article we define as subfertile those couples in whom routine investigations have 50 \nnot been able to identify any absolute barriers to conception such as blocked Fallopian tubes, 51 \nanovulation or azoospermia. Many of these couples are advised to undergo a period of expectant 52 \nmanagement, meaning that they continue trying to conceive naturally for a specified period of time 53 \nbefore being offered treatment. 54 \nData from non-contracepting populations (Bongaarts 1975) show that increase in the duration of 55 \nunsuccessful unprotected intercourse is associated with decreasing chances of pregnancy. However, 56 \nthe definition of infertility as a failure to conceive within a year represents an oversimplification, as 57 \nmany couples in this group will conceive beyond one year (Bongaarts 1975, Snick et al. 1997). The 58 \nonly certain way of \u2018diagnosing\u2019 absolute infertility in subfertile couples, i.e. establishing with 59 \ncertainty that a couple is sterile, is lack of conception in women at the end of reproductive life. By 60 \nthen of course it is too late to rectify the situation by medical means. Thus, in order to be a clinically 61 \nuseful entity, subfertility needs to reflect the prognosis of a couple in terms of their ability to 62 \n \n \n4 \n \nconceive unaided. Such an approach recognises the fact that apart from duration, a woman\u2019s ability 63 \nto conceive also declines with her age and depends on many other factors that vary the chances of 64 \nconception such as frequency of intercourse, semen quality and pelvic pathology (Evers 2002).  65 \nHaving acknowledged that subfertility represents a prognosis rather than an absolute diagnosis, it is 66 \nworth considering the best way of assessing the chances of pregnancy for the purposes of initiating 67 \ninvestigations and treatment. One option, which allows consideration of time on a continuous scale 68 \n(rather than dichotomously) and a couple\u2019s risk factors for conception, is to use appropriately 69 \ndeveloped and validated clinical prediction models. Many of these already exist in fertility and they 70 \neither predict the chances of pregnancy following treatment or without treatment, but not both 71 \n(Leushuis et al. 2009). However, a method of taking both groups into account to estimate the 72 \nadditional chances of pregnancy following treatment could allow clinicians to identify those who 73 \nwould benefit from it. For example, an absolute increase of 5% in the chance of pregnancy following 74 \nin vitro fertilization (IVF) compared to no treatment, might be important to a woman aged 38 whose 75 \nnatural chances of pregnancy have declined with age, but not to a woman aged 28 whose natural 76 \nchances are still relatively high. 77 \nIn this paper we describe the limitations of current clinical prediction models for subfertility and 78 \nsubsequently aim to explore the advancement of such models to address two key questions in 79 \nfertility care: firstly, how should clinicians discriminate between those who need active fertility 80 \ntreatment versus those who do not? Secondly, given that subfertility prognosis changes over time, 81 \nwhen should those on expectant management be offered active treatment? 82 \n 83 \nExisting clinical prediction models in subfertility 84 \nCritical for the management of a subfertile couple prior to initiation of treatment is knowledge of 85 \ntheir subfertility prognosis i.e. chances of spontaneous conception. As mentioned earlier, a way of 86 \n \n \n5 \n \nestimating subfertility prognosis is through clinical prediction modelling. A time-to-event statistical 87 \nmodel (such as the Cox proportional hazards model) is a good method of predicting the chances of a 88 \nbinary outcome, such as conception (versus no conception), over a period of time. Such models 89 \nadjust for prognostic factors, which are clinical or biological characteristics (such as female age and 90 \nduration of infertility) that are associated with a clinical outcome (such as spontaneous pregnancy) 91 \nin an untreated patient (Italiano 2011). Prognostic factors for subfertility can be obtained from the 92 \nmedical literature, clinical opinion or further research. Table 1 contains a list of known prognostic 93 \nfactors of spontaneous pregnancy from published models (Leushuis et al. 2009). The recently 94 \npublished Prognosis Research Strategy (PROGRESS) articles specify a framework of four interlinked 95 \nthemes for prognostic research. They recommend that large, prospective, registered prognostic 96 \nfactor studies with appropriate sample size and statistical analyses are required in order to find new 97 \nprognostic factors that can predict an outcome (Hemingway et al. 2013, Hingorani et al. 2013, Riley 98 \net al. 2013, Steyerberg et al. 2013). 99 \nA systematic review of clinical prediction models in reproductive medicine identified 29 prediction 100 \nmodels that predicted spontaneous pregnancy (n=9) or successful intrauterine insemination (IUI, 101 \nn=3) or IVF  n=17) (Leushuis et al. 2009). Of these 29 models, only eight were externally validated, 102 \nthree of which showed adequate performance (Custers et al. 2007, Hunault et al. 2004, Smeenk et 103 \nal. 2000, Steures et al. 2006, Steures et al. 2004, Templeton et al. 1996, van der Steeg et al. 2007). 104 \nAssessment of the predictive ability and external validation of a prediction model is essential if it is 105 \nto be used to facilitate clinical practice (Collins 2005, Coppus et al. 2009). Aspects to evaluate include 106 \ndiscrimination (how good a model is distinguishing between patients who do and do not become 107 \npregnant) and calibration (agreement between the probability estimate from the prediction model 108 \nand observed outcome frequencies) (Steyerberg 2009). 109 \nThe Hunault model, synthesised from three previous models based on three prospective databases 110 \nof subfertile women attending a Dutch University hospital, a Dutch general hospital and eleven 111 \n \n \n6 \n \nCanadian University Hospitals, was found to predict spontaneous pregnancy leading to live birth 112 \nreasonably well (Hunault et al. 2004). It had poor discriminatory ability, which is generally the case 113 \nwith prediction modelling in subfertile couples who tend to be rather homogeneous in terms of 114 \nclinical characteristics (Coppus et al. 2009), but calibrated well when applied to external cohorts 115 \n(Hunault et al. 2005, van der Steeg et al. 2007). 116 \nTwo other models, which showed acceptable performance in the Leushuis et al (2009) review, were 117 \nthe Steures et al (2006) model which predicts live birth following IUI, and the Templeton et al (1996) 118 \nmodel which predicts live birth following IVF. Both of these models also had poor discriminatory 119 \nability (Coppus et al. 2009, Smeenk et al. 2007). However, the Templeton model performs 120 \nreasonably well after adjusting for improved IVF success rates over time (te Velde et al. 2014). Since 121 \nthe Leushuis review, a model developed using the Human Fertilisation and Embryological Authority 122 \n(HFEA) database of all IVF treatments in the UK has been published (Nelson and Lawlor 2011) but 123 \nperformed no better than the Templeton model (te Velde et al. 2014). 124 \nA prognostic model could be used to make risk-based decisions in clinical practice. This would 125 \ninvolve calculating the absolute chance of spontaneous pregnancy occurring within a pre-specified 126 \ntime period, e.g. one year, for a given individual (see Figure 1, Model 1a). Decisions regarding 127 \nwhether or not to treat can then be made using some pre-specified clinically agreed chance cut-off. 128 \nFor example, the creators of the Hunault model considered couples with <20% chance of 129 \nspontaneous pregnancy as a poor prognosis group who should undergo immediate treatment 130 \n(Hunault et al. 2004). Those with >40% chance were labelled as having a high chance of spontaneous 131 \npregnancy and the article suggested that these couples should be encouraged to wait for another 132 \nyear. Those in the middle group of 20\u201340% chance should be advised in such a manner as to balance 133 \nthe probability of pregnancy against the risks from fertility treatment. 134 \nHowever, using probabilities from a model that predicts treatment independent pregnancy to make 135 \ntreatment decisions does not take into account the chance that treatment may not be effective in 136 \n \n \n7 \n \nparticular women. For example, being led solely by the above model cut-offs, a woman with a 15% 137 \nchance of pregnancy would undergo immediate treatment. However, depending on the woman\u2019s 138 \nspecific characteristics, her chance of pregnancy following treatment may be no greater, or, it may 139 \nbe substantially greater. Conversely, models that predict pregnancy following treatment do not tell 140 \nus whether the woman\u2019s absolute chance of pregnancy would have been any lower without 141 \ntreatment, and indeed how much lower (Figure 1, Model 1b). The best option would be to use a 142 \ncombined dataset, ideally from randomized controlled trial (RCT) data, including these two groups of 143 \nwomen in order to model the additional benefit of treatment over no treatment. This can be made 144 \npossible using a stratified medicine approach. 145 \n 146 \nAbsolute versus relative risk 147 \nBefore we consider stratified medicine it is important to define absolute and relative risk.  Absolute 148 \nrisk refers to the chance that a patient will have some outcome of interest (for example, a treated 149 \npatient has a 10% risk of mortality and a control patient has a 12.5% risk of mortality). The relative 150 \nrisk refers to the chance of the outcome for one group of patients compared with another (in the 151 \ngiven example the relative risk of mortality decreases by 20% for the treatment group compared to 152 \nthe control group). The word \u2018risk\u2019 is used since the outcome is often unfavourable. However, since 153 \npregnancy is a favourable outcome the term \u2018risk\u2019 is generally replaced with \u2018chance\u2019. If the relative 154 \neffect of treatment is constant for all patients, then the absolute benefit of treatment only increases 155 \nin relation to the baseline pregnancy chances. For example, if statins have a constant relative risk 156 \nreduction for all, then the absolute benefit is highest for those at highest risk of cardiovascular 157 \ndisease (LaRosa et al., 1999). 158 \n 159 \nTo treat or not to treat? - A stratified medicine approach 160 \n \n \n8 \n \nStratified medicine has been defined as \u2018the targeting of treatments (including pharmaceutical and 161 \nnon-pharmaceutical interventions) according to the biological or risk characteristics shared by 162 \nsubgroups of patients\u2019 (Hingorani et al. 2013). A clinician will use such an approach where the 163 \nrelative effect of treatment is believed to be inconsistent across patients. This means one or more 164 \npatient characteristics are associated with changes in the relative effect of treatment. Such 165 \ncharacteristics are called predictive factors of treatment response (Hingorani et al. 2013). The 166 \nstratified medicine approach allows targeting of therapy based on the combination of subfertility 167 \nprognostic factors and such treatment predictive factors, which increase the response to treatment 168 \nin relation to no treatment. This enables decisions to be made regarding who should receive such 169 \ntreatment. For example, in non-small cell lung cancer, the response of the disease to chemotherapy 170 \nis quite poor but there are therapy agents, gefitinib and erlotinib, which optimise therapy by being 171 \neffective only in patients whose tumours harbour specific epidermal growth factor receptor profiles 172 \n(Hall 2013). 173 \nIn the stratified medicine approach the relative effect of treatment is allowed to vary across patients 174 \naccording to their treatment predictive factors. The relative increase in pregnancy chances for 175 \ntreatment in relation to no treatment has limited value since it does not tell us from what baseline 176 \nchance (i.e. chance of pregnancy without treatment) the increase occurs. Stratified medicine 177 \nconsiders the absolute rather than the relative increase in chance of pregnancy with treatment since 178 \nthe former provides the more relevant individualised prediction of successful treatment to guide 179 \ndecision-making. 180 \nSome thought needs to be given to identifying factors that predict differential treatment response. 181 \nIn fertility, the success of treatment, such as IVF, is heavily influenced by factors such as female age 182 \n(van Loendersloot et al. 2010). As age is also a subfertility prognostic factor, increasing age may vary 183 \nthe additional effect of treatment over expectant management on chances of pregnancy. In other 184 \nwords, prognostic factors such as age, which affect the chance of spontaneous pregnancy and 185 \n \n \n9 \n \nsuccess of IVF may also be treatment predictive factors which determine the relative effectiveness of 186 \ntreatment (Hingorani et al. 2013). Of interest is the difference in these two relative effects. 187 \nMoreover, it is likely that an older woman whose chance of pregnancy with treatment is expected to 188 \nbe better than without, will require a more rapid resolution involving assisted reproduction, whilst a 189 \nyounger patient has sufficient time to undergo a series of less invasive (and cheaper) alternatives 190 \nfirst. We know that as female age increases the ability of assisted reproduction technology to make 191 \nup for all births lost by the natural decline of fertility decreases (Leridon 2004). Nevertheless, the 192 \nabsolute (and relative) benefit of treatment may be larger in older women than for younger women.  193 \nThere may also exist factors that are not necessarily prognostic that may predict the treatment 194 \nresponse. For example, in women with different tubal factor subfertility problems those with 195 \nhydrosalpinges had a poorer IVF pregnancy rate, which can be improved by salpingectomy (Johnson 196 \net al. 2011). Within such a cohort of women, subfertility prognosis would not be expected to vary 197 \nbetween different tubal factor diagnoses, but type of tubal factor subfertility is clearly a treatment 198 \npredictive factor. 199 \n 200 \nIssues to consider for a stratified approach 201 \nA stratified model can be developed from: i. one data source that has compared treated versus 202 \nuntreated patient outcomes; or ii. two separate sources \u2013 one to model subfertility prognosis and 203 \none to predict outcome following treatment. We will discuss these in turn. 204 \nOne data source, one model 205 \nThis involves using one dataset, preferably from an RCT, comparing treatment with no treatment. 206 \nOne can then examine the effect of prognostic factors for subfertility (main effects in a statistical 207 \nmodel) (Figure 1, Model 2a) together with treatment predictive factors (interaction terms in a 208 \nstatistical model) (Figure 1, Model 2b). 209 \n \n \n10 \n \nWe could not find any examples of a published stratified medicine analysis for fertility using 210 \ntreatment predictive factors. However, a recent study attempted the secondary analysis of 211 \nindividual patient data from RCTs to determine whether a patient\u2019s prognostic profile, based on a 212 \nscore from the Hunault model, influenced the effectiveness of different fertility treatments (van den 213 \nBoogaard et al. 2013). Investigating how the prognostic score from a model affects the treatment 214 \nresponse, rather than the individual treatment predictive factors which made up the score, is called 215 \na risk-stratified analysis (Kent DM 2007). 216 \nDue to heterogeneity in the treatment protocols of the included trials in the Van den Boogaard study 217 \nit was not possible to combine the individual patient data from each trial to conduct a meta-analysis. 218 \nThe modelling was performed in each trial separately. The study found no effect of prognostic 219 \nprofile on the effectiveness of different clinical strategies, including expectant management. This 220 \nhighlights the need for large RCTs with more heterogeneity in patient characteristics if they are to be 221 \nused for secondary analyses involving modelling (Farooq et al. 2013). However, this is an expensive, 222 \nchallenging and lengthy process. 223 \nAlthough large RCTs are the preference for stratified medicine research, the use of observational 224 \ndata containing treated and non-treated women is an alternative. Such data usually contain a larger 225 \nand more varied sample of patients than an RCT. An observational design requires high quality 226 \nelectronic healthcare data that can be record-linked in order to obtain an accurate history of the 227 \npatient\u2019s journey (Hemingway et al., 2013). However, observational data can suffer from serious 228 \nselection bias issues, and whilst there are methods available that may be able to account for some of 229 \nthese, the results of any analyses should be interpreted with caution. 230 \n 231 \nTwo separate data sources, two models 232 \n \n \n11 \n \nIn the absence of RCTs or observational databases containing both treated and non-treated women, 233 \na third approach is possible. This can use either previously published models \u2013 e.g. a prognostic 234 \nmodel for spontaneous pregnancy, such as Hunault, and a model predicting treatment dependent 235 \npregnancy, such as the Nelson and Lawlor IVF model \u2013 or develop new models for each outcome 236 \nusing two separate data sources. The advantage of the former method is that most of the work has 237 \nalready been done and it is much less expensive than setting up a prospective, or even a 238 \nretrospective, database from scratch. The difference in the absolute probability of success from both 239 \nmodels would give the absolute benefit of treatment (Figure 1, Models 1a and 1b combined). 240 \nHowever, a key problem with this method is the comparability of cohorts. The limitations of 241 \ncombining models developed from two different cohorts were highlighted in the recently updated 242 \nNational Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline on assessment and treatment for 243 \npeople with fertility problems (National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health 244 \n2013). A health economic analysis to compare the cost-effectiveness of different treatment 245 \nstrategies over a woman\u2019s reproductive life used the Hunault and the Nelson and Lawlor models to 246 \ninform the cost-effectiveness model with probabilities of cumulative live birth in women following 247 \nspontaneous pregnancy and IVF dependent pregnancy respectively. However, as the guideline 248 \nacknowledges, there were major limitations associated with this approach. For example, the Hunault 249 \nmodel was developed using a cohort of subfertile women, which excluded those who would not be 250 \nexpected to conceive naturally, meaning the severity of subfertility may not be as high as that in 251 \nwomen referred for IVF (the cohort used for the Nelson and Lawlor models). Further, the maximum 252 \nage of women used to develop the Hunault model was less than the maximum age included in the 253 \nNICE cost-effectiveness model, which may result in an overestimate of the probability of 254 \nspontaneous live birth in older aged women. However, if separate cohorts exist, which contain 255 \npatients with very similar characteristics, who undergo either expectant management or treatment, 256 \nthen previous models can be adapted to fit such data or new models can be developed. If such 257 \n \n \n12 \n \ncohorts are available then this two-model approach would be equivalent to using the one model 258 \napproach with statistical interaction terms between treatment and the treatment predictive factors. 259 \n 260 \nWhen to treat? \u2013 A dynamic prediction approach 261 \nAnother major aspect of clinical decision-making concerns the length of time couples should be 262 \nadvised to continue trying to conceive naturally before treatment should be offered. In order to do 263 \nthis we need a dynamic approach where we constantly assess the change in subfertility prognosis at 264 \ndifferent points in the future. One method is dynamic prediction modelling (van Houwelingen and 265 \nPutter 2012). This involves fitting multiple time to event models from sequential equally spaced time 266 \npoints to predict natural pregnancy over, say, the following year (see Figure 2). This process enables 267 \none to determine the impact of delayed treatment on the predicted probability of pregnancy at 268 \ndifferent points in time. This is not the same as using, for example the Hunault model, to obtain the 269 \nupdated chances of pregnancy as time goes on by iteratively updating the same woman\u2019s prognostic 270 \nfactors for subfertility at baseline (i.e. when the cause of infertility is established). Rather, as time 271 \nprogresses the more fertile couples are excluded from the cohort due to pregnancy.  Therefore 272 \nafter, for example, 6 months the cohort has reduced in size and is less fertile on average than the full 273 \nsized cohort on which the model was originally based.  Furthermore, since the original follow-up 274 \nperiod has been extended by 6 months (i.e. follow-up now ends 18 months from baseline as 275 \nopposed to 12 months) some of the women may have conceived during this period. Thus, different 276 \nmodel estimates will be obtained. 277 \nDynamic prediction could be used to advise those patients who are found to have a high chance of 278 \nconceiving spontaneously at their first visit on when to return for treatment if their attempts are 279 \nunsuccessful e.g. when their absolute chance of pregnancy dips below some pre-specified threshold. 280 \n \n \n13 \n \nIt could also be used to make decisions regarding the immediate treatment for couples who have a 281 \nlow probability of pregnancy at their initial visit, which will decline further with each passing month. 282 \nDynamic prediction should be used with the stratified medicine approach in order to estimate the 283 \nchange in the absolute benefit of treatment over time. In a couple with a good subfertility prognosis 284 \ninitially advised expectant management, this approach could be used to decide when in the future 285 \nthe absolute benefit of treatment is likely to trump their chance of spontaneous pregnancy such that 286 \nthe couple should be advised to return for treatment. 287 \nDynamic prediction requires a cohort of patients with a sufficient length of follow-up to enable 288 \nmodelling at different time points. For this reason, existing observational datasets would be more 289 \nsuitable than an RCT. Finally, as for all clinical prediction modelling, the key steps involved in 290 \ndevelopment and validation should be considered. The latter have been highlighted in the 291 \nPROGRESS series (Steyerberg et al. 2013). 292 \n 293 \nPractical recommendations 294 \nGiven the complexities of the above approach to individualised-decision making in subfertility 295 \ntreatment, it is worth considering some practical guidelines for clinical practice and research. Firstly, 296 \nthe decision whether to treat a subfertile patient requires careful consideration of her background 297 \nchance of spontaneous pregnancy and her predicted response to treatment. The former is 298 \ninfluenced by prognostic factors and the latter by treatment predictive factors. Currently, in the 299 \nNetherlands, an online prediction tool called \u2018Freya\u2019, based on the Hunault model, is used in clinical 300 \npractice to make treatment decisions based on the probability of spontaneous ongoing pregnancy 301 \nwithin the next 12 months (Hunault et al. 2004). However, clinicians should be aware that this model 302 \ndoes not provide an estimate of response to treatment. Currently, the only way to do this is to use a 303 \ncombination of existing models from the literature, such as the Hunault model and the Nelson and 304 \n \n \n14 \n \nLawlor model, which can be used to predict the chance of live birth following IVF. As mentioned 305 \nearlier, this approach was used in a cost-effectiveness analysis of IVF relative to expectant 306 \nmanagement by NICE who acknowledge the shortcomings of this approach (National Collaborating 307 \nCentre for Women's and Children's Health 2013). 308 \n 309 \nSecondly, clinicians looking after couples with unexplained subfertility need to make a conscious 310 \ndecision as to when treatment should be offered. Depending on patient characteristics, such as 311 \nfemale age, the live birth rate following one or more episodes of treatment will vary compared to 312 \nwhat might be expected without treatment. Thus, it may be better to treat some women straight 313 \naway after a diagnosis has been made, whilst in others a period of expectant management may lead 314 \nto comparable or better live birth rates without the expense and invasiveness of active treatment. 315 \nFrom the NICE analysis using the combined models, a 34 year old woman with two years of 316 \nunexplained infertility is predicted to have a treatment independent live birth rate of 20% (National 317 \nCollaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health 2013) compared to 40% after one cycle of 318 \nIVF. The same model predicts a live birth rate of 55% without treatment versus 70% following three 319 \ncomplete cycles of IVF over the next 11 years, suggesting that it would seem advantageous to offer 320 \nIVF treatment. 321 \nFinally, output from clinical predictive models need to be interpreted in the context of the individual 322 \ncircumstances of each couple. For fertility care to be genuinely patient centred, treatment decisions 323 \nshould involve couples themselves and accommodate their personal values and preferences (Dancet 324 \net al. 2011). 325 \n 326 \nConclusions 327 \n \n \n15 \n \nThe current one-year definition of infertility should be used as a trigger for referral to the fertility 328 \nclinic in order to initiate investigations and estimate prognosis \u2013 but not necessarily to begin 329 \ntreatment in all. 330 \nCurrent prognostic models in reproductive medicine are reasonably good at predicting the chances 331 \nof pregnancy in either women who are treated or those who are not. As none of the existing models 332 \ninclude both groups, predicting the marginal benefit of treatment versus no treatment is less 333 \naccurate. 334 \nWe advise the stratified medicine approach to identify those who actually benefit more from fertility 335 \ntreatment based on their prognostic and treatment predictive factors. Subsequently, the added 336 \nbenefit of treatment needs to be considered in context, for example in relation to the age of the 337 \nwoman. We also advise the dynamic prediction approach to estimate the patient\u2019s changing 338 \nsubfertility prognosis over time which could inform the decision about when to treat. 339 \nFurther research needs to be undertaken to identify treatment predictive factors and to identify or 340 \ncreate databases to allow these approaches to be explored. RCT data are preferred, but are the most 341 \nchallenging and expensive choice. In the interim, the most feasible option is to use output from a 342 \ncombination of previously published clinical prediction models, whilst acknowledging the specific 343 \nclinical circumstances of each couple and their preferences. 344 \n 345 \nAuthor\u2019s roles 346 \nDJM, SB and EWS proposed the concept.

Thus the numberof consumers has increased by 35% between 2003 and2006 about 87% of consumers buy organic foodoccasionally or more often and 77% would welcome abroader range of available organic products (AMA,2007).As far as preferences of consumers are concerned,consumption of organic food has been conceptualized asone aspect of high levels of positive attitudes towards theenvironment, or the other way round-environmentalconcern has \u201cbeen found to be a major determinant ofbuying organic food (Grunert and Juhl, 1995). However,the number of organic food consumers who areenvironmentally aware and demonstrate solidarity withorganic farmers is diminishing in favor of those whochoose organic food out of a larger product range basedon trade offs between price, time, and availability(Thomas and Grob,  2005).The body of social science literature dealing withissues of organic farming has grown steadily since 1990:Vogt (Vogt, 2000), has compiled the history of organicfarming, Thomas and Grob (Thomas and Grob, 2005)have assessed changes in principles of organic farmingand its importance in politics and society. Other studiesassess structures of how the organic sector is beingorganized (Schermer, 2005), its competitivenesscompared to conventional agriculture (Dabbert, 1990), butalso the attitudes of farmers towards organic farming andtheir changes in recent years (Oppermann, 2001; Padel,2006; Vogel and Larcher, 2007). Further research subjectsinclude the transition from conventional towards organicfarming (Fischer, 1982; Bichlbauer and Vogel, 1993), aswell as the impact of organic farming on ruraldevelopment, or the rural society (Schermer, 2006). Thereis also a number of studies on motives for buying or notYoung Researchers Club, Karaj Branch, Islamic Azad University, Karaj Branch, Karaj, IranRes. J. Appl. Sci. Eng. Technol., 4(3): 191-195, 2012192buying organic food, willingness to pay higher prices fororganic food (Hamm, 1986; Fricke, 1996), as well as ofmarkets,  marketing  and  regional  development (Hammet al., 2002; Hamm and Gronefeld, 2004; Schmid et al.,2004) with respect to organic food. An assessment of therapidly growing body of social science literatureconcerning the organic sector reveals that relatively littlehas been published on consumers\u2019 preferences. This isespecially true for different social groups, such as students(Freyer et al., 2005).Williams and Dollisso (1998) advanced that thediscipline of agricultural education (teaching and learningin agriculture) should become \u201can active partner inachieving the goals of a sustainable agriculture industry.Marshall and Herring (1991) believed that sustainableagriculture should be integrated into the curriculum.Integrating the technical and scientific elements ofsustainable agriculture would help upgrade the highschool agricultural education curriculum to meet theneeds of students preparing to enter the work force of the21st century food and fiber system (NCAE, 1995).Sustainable agriculture requires a long termperspective and continuing activities over severalgenerations. Threfore, performance and behavior ofcurrent agricultural students as agriculturist andprofessionals will ensure the sustainability of agriculturein the future. In this context, since attitudes, norm andvalue are important determinants of human behaviors andperformance, in long run; attitudes become especiallyimportant becouse they provide direction and purpose tobehaviors and performance (Hyytia and Kola, 2005).Thus, a better understanding of students\u2019 attitude oforganic farming would aid the development of teachingand learning initiatives in this area purposely. Regardingto this subjec, the following specific objectives wereinvestigated: C To find out attitude of students toward organicfarming.C To identify the most important components of theattitude of students toward organic farming.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe population identified to participate in this studywas agricultural students in agricultural colleges ofuniversity of Tehran, Mashhad, and Islamic AzadUniversity, Karaj branch. A sampling formula indicatedthat a total of 220 subjects should be sampled from thepopulation. A total of 220 students were randomlyselected to represent the population. The panel of expertswas used for assuring content validity. The instrumentwas pilot tested for clarity and reliability, the cronbach'salpha coefficient of internal consistency for the itemsmeasuring the students' perceptions toward organicfarming was 0.75 showed that research tool is reliable.The instrument assessed the agriculture students'perceptions students toward organic farming. Students\u2019knowledge was categorized with a score of 1 faded as lowknowledge until 6 high, to measure students' perceptionson 32 items related to organic farming used in this study.Analyses of data were accomplished using factor analysis.Factor analysis was utilized to reveal the latent aspectsbehind the student' opinions. The results that follow arebased on the response to the survey. The appropriatenessof the data for factor analysis was evaluated using Bartlett'test of sphericity.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONDemographic characteristics: Of the 220 studentssurveyed, 43.6% was male and 56.4% female. Theyranged between 18 and 28 years of age, with a mean ageof 22 years. 48% of students were studying cropproduction and breeding, 31% were studying AnimalScience and 21% were horticulture. 43.6% of them werestudent of Bachelor of Science; 36.7% were students ofMaster of Sciences; and 19.7% were Ph.D. students. Knowledge about organic farming:  To determine theknowledge of the respondents with regard to organicfarming, knowledge was categorized with a score of <30graded as low knowledge or unfavorable, 31-60moderately knowledge or neutral and >61 high knowledgeor favorable. The results in Table 1 indicated that amajority of the respondents, 48.6% had an unfavorableknowledge about organic farming, with 34.54% having amoderately knowledge and only 16.86% having a highknowledge.Factor analysis: In this study exploratory factor analysiswith data reduction approach was employed. The mainobjective of this technique is to classify a large number ofvariables into a small number of factors based onrelationships among variables. For this purpose 33variables were selected for the analysis. To determine theappropriateness of data and measure the homogeneity ofvariables on peasant farming system challenges from theviewpoints of extension personnel in the Ministry ofAgriculture, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) andBartlett\u2019s test measures were applied. These statisticsshow the extent to which the indicators of a constructbelong to each other. KMO and Bartlett\u2019s test obtained forthese Variables show that the data are appropriate forfactor analysis as indicated in Table 2.The Table 3 shows all the factors extractable from theanalysis along with their Eigen values, the percent ofvariance of the factor and the previous factors. In presentstudy, 33 components were significantly loaded into ninefactors. Eigen values drive the variances explained byeach factor. Sum of squares of factor's loadings (Eigenvalue) indicates the relative importance of each factor inaccounting for the variance associated with the set ofvariables being analyzed.

The food and fiber system is in thebeginning stages of responding not only to what humanityneeds today but also to what future generations willrequire. Despite a growing body of social studies onvarious aspects of organic farming, preferences ofdifferent consumer groups have not yet received fullattention. This is especially true for students. Ourliterature review revealed that only a few studies havebeen conducted to explore the attitudes of the younggeneration towards organic farming (Leitner et al., 2005;Freyer et al., 2005).Agricultural students play an important role inhelping to create and develop innovations. Given theimportance of their role, it is important to try andunderstand what student\u2019s knowledge is towards organicfarming. Results of this study indicated that respondents ratedthemselves as having limited knowledge of organicfarming practices. In this regard, the ratings of theirawareness about organic farming were relatively high forenvironmental and social dimensions, but less so for foodsecurity and economic aspects. Students\u2019 valued organicfarming Factor analysis indicated that 73% of variance instudents' awareness of organic farming was determined bythe 9 factors. To compare knowledge Components aboutorganic farming determined factors, the followingconclusions were drawn: C Factors of concepts, nutrient safety and security andorganic farming economic have cognitive and believeessence, in this context, students believed organicfarming is voucher ecological equilibrium and agroecosystem sustainability and in organic farmingshould be used incorporation of new technology andindigenous knowledge. C Organic farming economic, social aspect and organicfarming extension were identified as other factorsthat are shown student awareness surface. Finallyfactors of fertility, pests\u2019 management, environmentsafety, and organic product standards are otheraspects that determined by student and explain leastvariance rateC As a result, to enhance students\u2019 knowledge aboutorganic farming, it is important developingcurriculum to familiar student with organic farmingpractices and concepts such as: ecologicalequilibrium, agro ecosystem sustainability, newtechnology and indigenous knowledge, nutritionvalue, human safety, favorite yield production, soilstructure improvement, erosion reduces and etc. C Develop Farm-to-School FTS programs that havegarnered the attentions and energies of students in adiverse array of social location in the food andagricultural systems and are serving as a sort oftouchstone for many in the alternative agri-food(Allen and Guthman, 2006).C Develop programs of community gardens that havethe potential to positively influence dietary behaviorsand enhance environmental awareness andappreciation (Lautenschlager and Chery, 2007).C It is worth mentioning that the guideline results inmeeting the needs of students for preparing to enterthe work force of the 21st century food and fibersystem.Findings in this study may have implications on thecurriculum  agricultural  communication  faculty  wouldRes.

Agricultural communication faculty could teachstudents how to write persuasive messages or designcampaigns that influence farmers\u2019 attitudes towardadopting a farming practice such as organic farming.Knowing the barriers to adopting a farming practicewould help students tailor the messages. Commodityprofessionals could use the data about barriers to adoptingorganic farming to improve the farming technique. REFERENCESAllen, P. and J. Guthman, 2006.

      "abstract": "Animal-vehicle collisions are a common phenomenon worldwide, causing injury or death to millions of animals and hundreds of human passengers each year. Collision numbers can be significant to species conservation, wildlife management, traffic safety, as well as from an economic and political point of view, and should thus be evaluated from these different perspectives. In this thesis, I assess, evaluate, analyse and predict animal-vehicle collisions with respect to their extent, their effect on populations, and their broad and fine scale distribution. A questionnaire with Swedish drivers indicated that nationwide road traffic in 1992 may caused an annual loss in harvest of common game species of 7% to 97% and of 1% to 12% of estimated populations. Road mortality did not appear as an existential threat to most species, although in badgers (Meles meles), traffic probably is the largest single cause of death. A slow population growth rate coupled with a high proportion of adult badger road-kills is responsible for their sensitivity to road mortality. Provided that road mortality is additive, we predicted that losses due to nationwide traffic might already exceed birth rates and limit badger population growth.

In this thesis, \nI assess, evaluate, analyse and predict animal-vehicle collisions with respect to \ntheir extent, their effect on populations, and their broad and fine scale distribution. \nA questionnaire with Swedish drivers indicated that nationwide road traffic in \n1992 may caused an annual loss in harvest of common game species of 7% to 97% \nand of 1% to 12% of estimated populations. Road mortality did not appear as an \nexistential threat to most species, although in badgers (Meles meles), traffic \nprobably is the largest single cause of death. A slow population growth rate \ncoupled with a high proportion of adult badger road-kills is responsible for their \nsensitivity to road mortality. Provided that road mortality is additive, we predicted \nthat losses due to nationwide traffic might already exceed birth rates and limit \nbadger population growth. In roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and moose (Alces \nalces), road mortality is of minor importance to the population. Broad-scale trends \nand patterns in collision numbers correlate with harvest and traffic volumes, thus \nproviding a simple means to monitor the toll of road traffic. To predict local \ncollision risks with these species, information on animal abundance and landscape \ncomposition, on road traffic parameters, and on the spatial coincidence of roads \nand landscape elements is needed. However, vehicle speed appeared as one of the \nmost important factors determining collision risks with moose, underlining the \ninfluence of human factors on collision risks. Successful counteraction therefore \nrequires an interdisciplinary approach that addresses both the animal and the \ndriver in their shared environment. \n \nKey words: animal-vehicle collisions, fences, impact assessment, infrastructure, \nmitigation, road planning, traffic mortality, traffic safety.  \nAuthor\u2019s address: Andreas Seiler, Department of Conservation Biology, SLU, \nGrims\u00f6 Wildlife Research Station, SE-73091 Riddarhyttan, Sweden. \n 4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn the still of the night or day \nThere's a thumping sound on the highway \nWhat looked like a river was a road \nWith headlights for eyes and bumpers for toes \nBozo cruises at full speed ahead \nMr Todd is seconds from dead \nBlinded by a flash from heaven \nSmashed by heavy metal from hell \n \nAdapted from Arapaho, 1.2 Mile from Eden \n 5 \nContents \nIntroduction 7 \nThe extent of animal-vehicle collisions 11 \nRoad kill questionnaire 13 \nEvaluation of animal-vehicle collisions 15 \nHuman perspective 16 \nPolitical, ethical, and legal aspects 16 \nTraffic safety and economical concern 17 \nEcological perspective 18 \nSpecies conservation and population management 18 \nEffect on badger population dynamics 20 \nEvaluation in practise 22 \nFactors and patterns in animal-vehicle collisions 25 \nAnimal abundance 26 \nTraffic intensity 28 \nEnvironmental factors 31 \nMitigation against animal-vehicle collisions 33 \nExclusion fences 34 \nFauna passages 36 \nReduced animal density 37 \nConclusions 38 \nReferences 40 \nAcknowledgements 48 \n 6 \nAppendix \nPaper I-IV \nThis thesis is based on the following papers, which are referred to by their Roman \nnumerals. \nI.

Possible consequences to wildlife have been recognised and \nthere is evidence of direct and indirect effects at both species and ecosystem level \n(Forman et al. 2003). The physical presence of roads, railways, and canals in the \nlandscape dissects habitats, disrupts natural processes, alters microclimate and \ngroundwater flow, but also introduces new and potentially valuable habitats. \nMaintenance and operational activities contaminate the surrounding environment \nwith a variety of chemical pollutants and noise. In addition, infrastructure and \ntraffic impose movement barriers to most terrestrial animals and cause the death of \nbillions of animals each year. These various biotic and abiotic effects operate in a \nsynergetic way, locally as well as at a broader scale, leading to a fragmentation of \nwildlife habitat in a broad sense (Seiler 2003). \nNumerous field reports, conference proceedings, reviews, and handbooks have \nbeen published on this topic so far (Bernard et al. 1987, Reck & Kaule 1993, \nCanters et al. 1997, Rosell Pag\u00e8s & Velasco Rivas 1999, Forman et al. 2003, \nTrocm\u00e9 et al. 2003). Nevertheless, there is still need to improve our understanding \nof the complex pressure of transport infrastructure on wildlife populations and the \nenvironment. Authorities urgently ask for adequate methods to predict, evaluate, \nand counteract adverse effects, and implement this knowledge into the planning \nand maintenance of transport infrastructure in order to meet sector-level policies \non sustainable development and conservation of biodiversity (Eriksson & Skoog \n1996, Westermark 1996, Iuell et al. 2003). Mitigation concepts are needed that \noperate at both strategic and project planning level and can affect the underlying \ncauses as well as the resulting effects and consequences to populations and society \n(Pettersson & Eriksson 1995, Canters et al. 1997, Cuperus et al. 1999). In many \ncases, dose-effect relationships need to be quantified and potential thresholds \nidentified, before adequate mitigation can be chosen and eventually implemented. \nExisting ecological knowledge must be combined with economical and social \nsciences to achieve a holistic approach that allows the whole range of ecological \nfactors operating across the landscape to be integrated within the planning process \n(Seiler & Eriksson 1997, Damard 2003). This does not apply solely to the \nplanning of transport infrastructure, but likewise to all exploitation and \nmanagement of natural resources.  \nA recent tool to describe, analyse, and manage human impacts on the \nenvironment and its consequences to environmental quality is the so called DPSIR \nframework (Luiten 1999, Anonymous 1999). It helps to distinguish causal \nlinkages between driving forces (D) such as policy or economy, their pressure (P) \nto environmental state (S) and the impact (I) on wildlife and society that initiates a \nresponse (R) in policy or legislation affecting the \u2018driving forces\u2019 or providing \ndirect feed-back to the sources of \u2018pressure\u2019 (Figure 1). The DPSIR approach has \nfound ample appliance in environmental monitoring and management in Sweden \n(e.g., Anonymous 1999, Segnestam & Persson 2002). However, the problem still \nremains to define adequate indicators that help to quantify pressures and impacts. 8 \nNo such indicators have yet been implemented to tackle habitat fragmentation \ncaused by transport infrastructure or measure the overall ecological impact of \nroads and railways on wildlife; proposals have been made however (e.g., \nWestermark 1996, Damard et al. 2003).  \nIt is within this context that the present thesis and its four papers should be \nviewed. In this thesis, I have chosen to focus on the problem of animal-vehicle \ncollisions, although this issue is only one among several, and certainly not even \nthe most important pressure of transport infrastructure on wildlife. However, it is \neasily monitored and can be evaluated in a quantitative way as required for the \ndevelopment of indicators. It is also intimately linked with other direct effects of \ninfrastructure such as barrier and disturbance effects, and it relates to both animals \n(road mortality) and humans (traffic safety) (e.g., Seiler 2003).  \n \nDriving forces\ni.e., forestry, agriculture, \ntransportation, \nurbanisation\nState of environment\ni.e., traffic intensity, road density,\nfragmentation patterns, \ntraffic casualties\nImpact on populations\ni.e., habitat fragmentation, \nreduced population sizes, \nincreased mortality, \naltered community structre\nPressures on environment\ni.e., habitat loss, disturbances, \npollution, animal-vehicle\ncollisions, barrier effects\nResponse of society\ni.e., changed policy & legislation, \nenvironmental directives, \nmitigation & compensation\nmeasures\n \n \nFigure 1. Schematic representation of the causal links within the DPSIR framework. \n \nIn the following, I first discuss the extent of animal-vehicle collisions and present \nnew estimates of the number of road-killed mammals in Sweden. This knowledge \nis crucial for the evaluation of mitigation needs. Evaluating animal-vehicle \ncollisions can and must be done from different perspectives including ecological, \neconomical, ethical, and political viewpoints. I discuss these different \nperspectives, with special emphasis on ecological aspects, and conclude that for \nthe most part economic and traffic safety concerns will be more stringent and \nconservative. If the problem is considered significant and counteractive measures \nare required, for whatever reason, more effort is needed to analyse what factors \ndetermine the spatial and temporal distribution of animal-vehicle collisions. I 9 \npresent analyses of trends and spatial patterns in ungulate-vehicle collisions, at \nboth broad and local scales. Finally, I discuss two major mitigation options and \ntheir efficacy in reducing the likelihood of collisions with moose.  \nThese steps are represented by the papers included in this thesis: \nI.  In paper I, we present new estimates of the magnitude of road mortality in \nsome medium-sized and large mammals in Sweden, based on the results of \na drivers\u2019 questionnaire. In the questionnaire, we asked drivers to estimate \nthe total mileage they had driven and the number of collisions with wild \nmammals larger than mice with which they were personally involved as \ndrivers during a period they were free to choose, but for which they were \nconfident that they could remember any incident. By summarizing the \ndriven mileage and the number of collisions reported by all respondents, we \ncalculated a frequency of collisions that could be extrapolated to a national \nlevel. Although the sample size was limited (705 replies with 343 \ncollisions), and the reported number uncertain, the estimates were \nsurprisingly concordant with independent statistics on, e.g., police reported \nungulate-vehicle collisions and earlier road-kill studies. For most species \nincluded in our survey, the level of road mortality did not appear as a threat \nto the nationwide survival of the species. In badgers (Meles meles), \nhowever, estimated road-kill was considerably larger than previously \nassumed. In addition, the ratio of road-killed to hunted animals appears to \nincrease in several species, suggesting that the relative importance of road \ntraffic has risen during the past decades. Our results further suggest that \ndrivers\u2019 questionnaires can be a practical and inexpensive way of \nmonitoring animal-vehicle collisions at broad scale.  \nII.  In paper II, we evaluated the significance of road mortality to a selected \nspecies, the badger, and estimated the critical level of road mortality that a \nbadger population can sustain without decline. Nationwide road kill \nestimates for badger (paper I) were significantly higher than previously \nassumed and road traffic is probably the largest single cause of death in this \nspecies. We used life table analysis and matrix population models to assess \na stable age-structure and population growth. Demographic parameters \namong road-killed badgers were estimated from literature and from 76 \ncarcasses that we collected from public roads. Our population models \nsuggested that losses due to road traffic account for 12-13% of the post-\nbreeding population, which is close to the maximum sustainable loss. \nAssuming the number of road-killed badgers is proportional to traffic \nintensity, we predict that between 1978 and 2049 nationwide road traffic \nwill kill more badgers than the population can sustain without declining. In \nother words, this critical threshold may already be passed in areas of low \nbadger density and high traffic loads. We recommend showing greater \nconcern for this species when planning and maintaining roads in such areas.  \nIII.  In paper III, I investigated the influence of traffic and population density on \ntrends and spatial patterns in ungulate-vehicle collisions. Naturally, for a \ngiven species, collision numbers should be a function of the abundance of \nvehicles and animals, although this relationship may not necessarily be \nlinear. I could show that during the past 30 years in Sweden, changes in 10 \ncollision numbers were strongly related to changes in annual game bags and \ntraffic intensity. With increased resolution, however, other environmental \nfactors such as land cover, road density, and the presence of mitigation \nmeasures gained significance over the density of ungulates and vehicles. \nSpatial patterns were studied at the level of individual hunting areas \n(N=311), moose management districts (N=95), and counties (N=22), \nwhereas trends in ungulate-vehicle collisions (UVC) were studied at \nnational, county, and district level covering periods of 30, 16, and 12 years, \nrespectively. Thus, prediction and evaluation of ungulate-vehicle collisions \nare scale-dependent, whereas large-scale relationships do not necessarily \napply at local scales. To develop spatially explicit models, improved \nknowledge about passage design, fence location, and occurrence of UVC in \ntime and space is needed.  \nIV.  In paper IV, I developed logistic regression models to predict the risk for \nvehicle collisions with moose (Alces alces) on public roads based on \nremotely sensed landscape data, road and traffic statistics, moose harvest as \nan index of population densities, and collision statistics from 1990 to 1999. \nI quantified environmental data from 2000 accident and 2000 non-accident \ncontrol sites in south-central Sweden (mainly the county of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland) \nand tested the predictions on 2600 one-km road sections classified as either \naccident or non-accident roads in the county of \u00d6rebro. Traffic volume, \nvehicle speed, and the occurrence of exclusion fences appeared as the \ndominant road-traffic factors determining collision risks, identifying 72.7% \nof all accident sites. Within a given road category, however, the amount of \nand distance to forest cover, density of intersections between forest edges, \nprivate roads and the main accident road, and moose abundance indexed by \nharvest statistics significantly distinguished between accident and control \nsites. In combination, road-traffic and landscape parameters produced an \noverall concordance in 83.6% of the predicted sites and identified 76.4% of \nall test road sections correctly. The risk of moose-vehicle collisions in \nSweden can thus be predicted from remotely sensed landscape data in \ncombination with road traffic data. Combining road fences with designated \nwildlife passages, increased roadside clearance, and reduced vehicle speed \nmay provide the most effective mitigation measures against collisions with \nmoose.  \nA natural continuation of these studies will be the analysis of spatio-temporal \npatterns in collisions. How does season, weather, or daylight influence effects of \nhabitat, topography, and latitude on the occurrence of collisions? Traffic flow, \nanimal abundance, and animal activity fluctuate at diurnal and seasonal intervals, \nas do records of animal-vehicle collisions (e.g., Lavsund & Sandegren 1991, \nGroot-Bruinderink & Hazebroek 1996, Gundersen & Andreassen 1998). It is \npossible that the patterns studied in paper III and IV will become even clearer if \ntheir actual timing is considered.  \n 11 \nThe extent of animal-vehicle collisions \n \nThe \u2018toll of the automobile\u2019 (sensu Stoner 1925) is certainly the most widely \nacknowledged effect of transport infrastructure on wildlife. Since the appearance \nof the automobile, road and railway kills of wildlife have been of public concern \n(Stoner 1925, Dickerson 1939, Haugen 1944, McClure 1951, Hodson & Snow \n1965, Way 1970, Jonkers & De Vries 1977, Hansen 1982, Lalo 1987, Van den \nTempel 1993, Caletrio et al. 1996, Rodts et al. 1998, Huijser 2000, Forman et al. \n2003). Road-killed fauna includes a widespread variety of terrestrial animal \nspecies, regardless of whether it has a backbone, wings, or legs. Smashed and \nflattened animals alongside roads or railways have become part of the common \nexperience of humans around the world, and are probably seen by many more \npeople than their living conspecifics (e.g., Knutson 1987). The numbers of \ncasualties appear to be steadily growing as traffic increases and infrastructure \nnetworks expand. In their review, Forman & Alexander (1998) concluded that \n\u2018sometime during the last three decades, roads with vehicles probably overtook \nhunting as the leading direct human cause of vertebrate mortality on land\u2019.  \nThe pure numbers of road kills may illustrate the extent of the problem. National \nroad-kill estimates range from some hundred thousand to some hundred million \ncasualties each year (Table 1). Fortunately, only a small fraction of all animal-\nrelated traffic accidents cause human injury or death (Seiler & Folkeson 2003). \nFor the involved animals, however, collisions with vehicles are usually fatal. For \nexample, approximately 92% of all moose and 98% of all roe deer involved in \npolice-reported vehicle collisions in Sweden ultimately died as a consequence of \nan accident (Almkvist et al. 1980). In smaller, slower species, this percentage is \nlikely much higher (Table 1).  \nUnfortunately, most national road-kill estimates are not related to road density, \ntraffic work (driven mileage), or animal density. In addition, most estimates are \nextrapolations of rather limited data (but see Caletrio et al. 1996, Rodts et al. \n1998) obtained by field inventories, drivers\u2019 interviews, or expert estimates. Due \nto differences in quality and uncertainties in these numbers, a quantitative \ncomparison among countries is likely not feasible. \nIn many countries, statistics on vehicle collisions with large ungulates (UVC) \nprovide the most detailed and extensive road kill estimates, because accidents with \nthese species often involve material damage and considerable risk of human \ninjury. In the United States, it was estimated that more than a half million \ncollisions with deer (Odocoileus spp.) occurred in 1991 (Romin & Bissonette \n1996). Within Europe (excluding Russia), approximately 500,000 UVC are \nrecorded each year, with Sweden contributing the greatest number of UVC per \nyear, followed by Austria and Germany (Groot-Bruinderink & Hazebroek 1996). \nThe conflict between ungulates and vehicles in Sweden was highlighted already \nduring the late 1960\u2019s (Anonymous 1971), when UVC accounted for 19% of all \npolice reported road accidents. In recent years, this percentage has exceeded 60% \nand UVC records amounted to over 5,000 moose, 25,000 roe deer (Capreolus \ncapreolus), 2,000 reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), and approximately 1,000 other 12 \nungulates each year (paper III, Lavsund & Sandegren 1991). This increase \ncoincided with a doubling in traffic volume since 1970, but more important for \ntrends and large-scale spatial patterns in UVC was the increased abundance of \nmoose and roe deer (paper III).  \n \nTable 1.

Studies during the 1970\u2019s \nsuggested that about 25% of all UVC with human injury involved and \napproximately 60% of all other UVC were not filed by SNRA. Collisions with \nmoose on highways seemed more likely to be recorded than collisions with roe \ndeer on county roads. However, this pattern was not conclusive and the authors \nrecommended assuming a standard proportional loss of 60% (Almkvist et al. \n1980). Thus, the true number of UVC occurring in Sweden may be at least twice \nthe size as suggested by official statistics (paper I).  13 \nIn Sweden, little is known about vehicle collisions with other species than \nungulates. Early studies on wildlife road casualties date back to the 1960\u2019s \n(Bengtsson 1962) and 1970\u2019s (Bolund 1974, G\u00f6ransson et al. 1978). Initial \nnational road kill estimates ranged from 550,000 to 20 million wild animals per \nyear (Bolund 1974). More accurate estimates were obtained by G\u00f6ransson et al. \n(1978) who conducted intensive inventories along roads in south-central Sweden. \nThey suggested nationwide mortalities may reach a minimum of 1.0 million birds \nand 0.5 million medium-sized mammals (excluding small mammals and ungulates) \nannually. For most species, road mortality was considered being within tolerable \nlimits, accounting for less than 5% of the assumed population size. Since this \nstudy, however, traffic intensity has increased by approximately 50%, the length \nof motorways has doubled (Anonymous 2000), and numbers of UVC increased \nfourteen-fold (paper III). It is, therefore, reasonable to believe that road mortality \nhas also increased in other species. A recent estimate on avian road-kills, for \nexample, suggested as many as 8.5 million birds casualties on Swedish roads in \n1995 (Svensson 1998). This is eight times greater than suggested by G\u00f6ransson et \nal. (1978).  \n \nRoad kill questionnaire \nWe obtained updated information on animal-vehicle collisions in Sweden (paper \nI). During 2000 and 2001, we sent out a questionnaire to Swedish car drivers, \nasking them to estimate the number of animals per driven mileage they had \ncollided with during a specified time. A total of 705 drivers\u2019 reports could be \nevaluated, covering 243.6 million travelled km from 1960 to 2000. The reports \nsuggested a total loss of between 7,000-13,500 moose, 43,500-59,000 roe deer, \n63,500-81,500 hares (Lepus spp.), 22,000-33,000 badgers, and 6,500-12,500 foxes \n(Vulpes vulpes) during the mean reference year 1992 (paper I, Table 3). Among \nthese game species, the extrapolated nationwide road-kill ranged between 7% and \n97% of the average annual harvest, and between 1% and 12% of the assessed total \npopulations in 1992. The frequency of road-kills appeared to have increased over \nthe past 40 years, probably because of changes in traffic volume and population \nsizes (harvest) (Figure 2). However, in badgers and hares, the ratio of estimated \nroad-kill to the annual harvest increased two-fold, which suggests an increase in \nthe relative importance of road mortality. If the relationship between road-kill \nfrequency and traffic volume is constant, and density of animals the similar to \n1992, then road traffic in 2002, for example, may kill up to 15,000 moose, 64,500 \nroe deer and 36,500 badgers.  \nOf course, the uncertainty in these estimates is large and there is also risk for \nbias in the reported accidents, but the results are concordant with independent \nestimates on animal-vehicle collisions and well in line with official UVC statistics \nif adjusted for the 60% unregistered accidents (paper I). Our study suggested that \ndriver interviews can be a cost-efficient source of information on road kills at least \nfor larger wildlife. Provided that road networks are extensive, traffic volumes \nquantified, and data on animal-vehicle collisions can be obtained in a standardized \nway, our study suggested that driver interviews can be a cost-efficient source of \ninformation on road kills at least for larger wildlife. Crucial to such assessment is, 14 \nhowever, control of the large bias that can be expected due to differences in \ndrivers remember collisions with wildlife, are reliable in their identification of the \nspecies, and are willing to report the true number of incidents. We recommend \ntherefore to use standardized and shortened reference periods (for example one \nyear), and exact estimates of the driven mileages. Such data could be obtained for \nexample during the annual safety inspections on motor vehicles made by the \nSwedish Motor Vehicle Inspection Company (Svensk Bilprovning AB).  \nIn extension to our data, we agree with several other researchers (Jahn 1959, \nMcCaffery 1973, G\u00f6ransson & Karlsson 1979, Hicks 1993, Loughry & \nMcDonough 1996) who recommended using road-kill indices for the monitoring \npopulaitons of large and medium sized mammals that eventually might be superior \nto harvest statistics. \n \n10 15 20 25 30 35 40\nREFERENCE PERIOD (YEARS BEFORE 2002)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\nR\nO\nA\nD\n \nK\nI\nL\nL\n \n/\n \nG\nA\nM\nE\n \nB\nA\nG\n \nR\nA\nT\nI\nO\n \n(\n%\n)\nbadger \u00b1 CI\nhares \u00b1 CI\nroe deer \u00b1 CI\nfox\nmoose\nsmall mustelids\n \nFigure 2. Change in the ratio between estimated road kill in Sweden (with 95% confidence \nlimits) and annual harvest in relation to the length of reference periods covering the past 40 \nyears (1960 \u2013 2000). In badgers (Meles meles) and hares (Lepus spp.), the ratio increased \ntwo-fold as the maximum number of reference years was limited from 40 to 10 years (paper \nI, Figure 1).  \n \nAlthough this thesis deals exclusively with animal-vehicle collisions on roads, one \nshould also bear in mind that railway traffic also kills a hitherto unknown but \ncertainly large number of animals each year (Seiler & Folkeson 2003). Radio-\ntelemetry studies on over 400 moose from 4 regions in Sweden suggest that trains \nmay account for up to half of all traffic related mortality in moose populations (K. \nWallin & G. Cederlund, unpubl. data). Thus far, Swedish rail authorities have not \ngranted permission to conduct inventories of train-animal collisions, but since the \nyear 2000, train engineer reports on animal-related issues are filed by the Swedish \nRail Administration. Preliminary analyses of these first statistics suggest that trains \nmay kill at least 1,000 roe deer and 900 moose each year (my wife, pers. 15 \ncomments). In the northern rail district, approximately 5 moose are killed annually \nper 100 km railway, with peak rates during winter (Johansson & Larsson 1999). \nFor comparison, car traffic on public roads in northern Sweden causes less than 3 \nmoose casualties per 100 km and year (SNRA, database). However, it is unknown \nto what degree official reports represent the true number of animal kills and \nwhether this relationship applies to species other than moose and roe deer.  \n \n \nEvaluation of animal-vehicle collisions \n \nThe amount of road mortality is staggering indeed, but is this toll really significant \nand always worthy the costs of mitigation? Evaluating the importance of animal-\nvehicle collisions is a complex task and must involve ecological, economical, \nsocial, and technical perspectives and consider both regional and local scales \n(Figure 3). For example, animal-vehicle collisions may be insignificant for the \nconservation of larger herbivores, but may still conflict with harvest management \ngoals or even be unacceptable for traffic safety reasons. On the other hand, \ncollisions with smaller species such as amphibians may be substantial to the \nsurvival of local populations but receive lesser public concern than accidents with \nungulates. National estimates of road mortality in wildlife may appear negligible, \nbut the local impact may be considerable.  \nTraffic safety\nEconomy\nEthics Policy\nLegislation\nManagement\nConservation\nSignificance\nof animal-\nvehicle\ncollisions\nTraffic safety\nEconomy\nEthics Policy\nLegislation\nManagement\nConservation\nSignificance\nof animal-\nvehicle\ncollisions\n \nFigure 3. Different perspectives from which animal-vehicle collisions can be evaluated. 16 \nHow great a loss can a species cope with? How great an impact are we willing \nto accept? There are no simple rules or thresholds defined thus far that could guide \ndecision-making, but in many cases, it is probably a political issue rather than a \nbiological problem, to determine whether the extent of animal-vehicle collisions is \ncritical and counteraction necessary or not.  \n \nHuman perspective \nPolitical, ethical, and legal aspects \nFrom an animal welfare point of view, any collision between wild animals and \nmotor vehicles is troublesome because it causes unnecessary and partially \navoidable suffering and damage to the animal involved (e.g., Sainsbury et al. \n1995, Fehlberg 1994). Smaller animals probably suffer less as they die \nimmediately upon impact, but the larger the animal, the greater is the proportion of \nwounded survivors. In Sweden, for example, Almkvist et al.  (1980) documented \nthat about 25% of all roe deer but 64% of all moose involved in police reported \nvehicle collisions were not killed immediately but died later or had to be tracked \ndown and shot because of their injuries. The true proportion of injured ungulates \nis certainly much higher, because collisions that are not perceived as serious by the \ndriver (although the animal may suffer internal injury) may not be reported to the \npolice.  \nThe risk to collide with wild animals on roads or railways worries many people \nin Sweden (e.g., Johansson & Larsson 1999). Many respondents to our road kill \nenquiry (paper I), for example, expressed concern for animals they injured but \nwere not killed. Especially collisions with large mammals can be traumatic to the \ndriver (if not hazardous). The European public is generally more concerned about \nkilling and injuring wildlife than about habitat destruction or air pollution (Kirby \n1997). Nonetheless, there is better legal protection for the physical environment \nthan for the welfare of organisms living within. Animal protection laws at a \nEuropean level, as well as in Sweden (Animal Welfare Act, 1988:534), make it an \noffence to cause unnecessary suffering in captive or domestic but not in free-living \nanimals. Only Norway and Finland provide legal protection for the welfare of wild \nanimals (Norwegian Animal Welfare Act (Code: 750.000, 16.06.95), Finnish Act \non Animal Protection (247/1996)). Sainsbury et al. (1993) illustrated this \ninconsistency in a large number of cases across the European Community, where \nthe welfare of wildlife had been compromised due to human activities, including \ncollisions with vehicles and hunting activities. The authors developed a \nmethodology for the assessment of wildlife welfare (Kirkwood et al. 1994) and \nsuggested it to be integrated in environmental impact assessment (EIA). However, \nresistance to include welfare of wildlife under legal protection is strong, as it may \nhave considerable consequences to e.g., hunting and fishing practises and \nrecreational land use.  \nIn European policies and directives, the issue of animal-vehicle collisions is \ninstead considered as part of the ecological problem of habitat fragmentation \ncaused by transport infrastructure (e.g., OECD 1994, Trocm\u00e9 et al. 2003). The \nEuropean Strategic Environmental Impact Assessment (SEA) Directive 17 \n(2001/42/EC) enforces the integration of ecological aspects in future planning and \nprogramming of infrastructure. Recently, a new \u2018Code of Practice for the \nIncorporation of Landscape and Biodiversity in the Planning of Linear Transport \nInfrastructure\u2019 has been developed by the European Council for endorsement in \n2003 that includes recommendations for integration of the Pan-European \nBiological and Landscape Diversity Strategy in environmental impact assessment \n(Damard et al. 2003). Habitat fragmentation issues (including road mortality) are \nalso considered in the new environmental goals for the transport sector in Sweden \n(Eriksson & Skoog 1996, Westermark 1996, Seiler & Eriksson 1997). However, \nthese policies consider the survival of a species and the maintenance of \nbiodiversity, rather than the welfare of individual animals.  \n \nTraffic safety and economical concern \nIn most countries, traffic safety and economy are the driving forces behind \nmitigation efforts against animal-vehicle collisions (e.g., Hartwig 1991, Romin & \nBissonette 1996, Putman 1997, Trocm\u00e9 et al. 2003). This occurs even though the \ntotal socio-economic costs are systematically underestimated, central statistics are \noften incomplete, and the usual assessment methods inadequate (Borer & Fry \n2003). In most European countries, animal-vehicle collisions are believed to make \nup only a small proportion of the total number of traffic accidents. In The \nNetherlands, for example, only 0.3% (29 out of 11,124) reported accidents \ninvolving personal injury or death were due to animals (Borer & Fry 2003). This \ncontrasts the situation in Sweden where about 8% of all road accidents that \ninvolved human injuries or deaths and more than 60% of all police reported road \naccidents were due to collisions with ungulates (paper III). Of course, there is a \ndirect relationship between the seriousness of collisions with animals and the size \nof the animals involved. The larger the species, the greater is the risk for material \ndamage and human injury. Indeed, moose are among the most dangerous animals \nin Sweden, on average about 12 humans are killed and more than 600 are injured \nin collisions with ungulates annually, most of which (78%) included moose. Its tall \nshoulder height and heavy body weight can result in collisions where the whole \nbody mass of the animal strikes directly against the windshield pillars and the \nfront roof of the vehicle. Such accidents can cause severe head and neck injuries \nto front seat passengers (Bj\u00f6rnstig et al. 1986).  \nThe SNRA calculates an average direct cost of between 7,400 and 20,000 \u20ac per \nmoose-vehicle collision, but only between 1,400 and 2,800 \u20ac per collision with roe \ndeer or reindeer, depending on the speed of the vehicle and the severity of the \nhuman injury (Seiler & Folkeson 2003). Annually, the direct cost of ungulate-\nvehicle collisions in Sweden probably exceeds 100 million \u20ac (paper III), while in \nNorway, annual costs for about 1,200 recorded moose-vehicle collisions sum up to \n11-17 million \u20ac. An average moose accident has been evaluated to 9,100 or 14,400 \n\u20ac, depending on whether only the material damage to the vehicle or also the cost to \nmoose management is included (Stikbakke & Gaasemyr 1997). At the European \nlevel (excluding Russia), vehicle collisions with ungulates have been estimated to \nexceed half a million incidents each year, including 300 human fatalities and \n30,000 injuries, producing a total cost of more than 1 billion \u20ac (Groot-Bruinderink \n& Hazebroek 1996).  18 \nSuch economic estimations usually include costs for material damage, and \nhuman injuries and fatalities, but rarely account for \u201cexternal\u201d costs such as loss of \nmeat or hunting opportunities, call-out costs for veterinarians, gamekeepers and \npolice to deal with injured or dead animals, costs for ambulances and any \nsubsequent human medical costs, or societal costs of traffic delays. Understanding \nthe external costs of animal-vehicle collisions is crucial when assessing the \nmonetary value of mitigation measures - and the funds that should be made \navailable for further research or mitigation measures (Borer & Fry 2003). \nEstimations made thus far are unsatisfactory and hardly applicable in road \nplanning. With increasing internalization of external costs in the transport sector \nand increasing constraints on public spending, there is a strong need to improve \neconomic models and methods for evaluating nature and wildlife (e.g., Cedermark \n& von Koch 2000).  \n \nEcological perspective \nSpecies conservation and population management \nDespite the huge numbers of road-kills occurring each year, road traffic likely has \nnot yet had a significant effect on survival or management of most small and \ncommon wildlife species. In rodents, rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), foxes, and \nmany song birds that often dominate road-kill statistics, traffic usually contributes \nless than 5% to the overall (direct) mortality (Haugen 1944, Vestjens 1973, Adams \n& Geis 1973, Bergmann 1974, Oxley et al. 1974, Schmidley & Wilkins 1977, \nG\u00f6ransson et al. 1978, Caletrio et al. 1996). Instead, high numbers of road kills \nmay instead indicate that species are abundant and widespread. Road kill statistics \nmay even be more reliable than hunting statistics in reflecting large scale trends in \ngame species (paper III). \nAlso in most game species, road mortality is not considered a conservation \nproblem (Groot-Bruinderink & Hazebroek 1996). Still, traffic losses should be \nconsidered in harvest goals and should reduce maximum sustainable yield to a \nhunter, if management strategies aim to balance game populations against \nenvironmental, social, and economic constraints. Moose population dynamics, for \nexample, are mainly regulated through hunting (Cederlund & Markgren 1987, \nSylv\u00e9n et al. 1987, Sylv\u00e9n 2003). Road kills in moose account for approximately \n10% of the annual harvest or 3-5% of the total population (paper I, III). This loss \nis considered ecologically sustainable and economically acceptable, at least at a \nnational level (Lavsund & Sandegren 1991). However, since road kills in Sweden \nare usually not included in ordinary moose licenses of an area, the planned harvest \ndoes not compensate for traffic losses and in certain hunting districts, more moose \nare eventually killed by vehicles than shot by hunters (paper III, see also Schwartz \n& Bartley 1991, Child 1998). In Norway, for comparison, traffic mortality is \nconsidered in moose management plans, which aim to keep the ratio of traffic \nlosses to harvest below 4% at a national and 10% at a municipal level (Stikbakke \n& Gaasemyr 1997).  \nNevertheless, there is evidence for a significant effect of road mortality on \ncertain wildlife populations including some rare species (e.g., Forman et al. 2003). 19 \nFor instance, traffic is especially dangerous to herpetofauna (Blaustein & Wake \n1990, Hels & Buchwald 2001). Road density has a proven negative effect on \nsurvival and recruitment of amphibian populations and the risk for local \nextinctions increases with proximity of breeding ponds to well-travelled roads \n(Sj\u00f6gren-Gulve 1994, Fahrig et al. 1995, Vos & Chardon 1998). Traffic losses can \nbe significant to population recruitment in several large mammals such as Florida \npanther (Felis concolor) (Harris & Scheck 1991, Foster & Humphrey 1995) and \nFlorida Key deer (Odocoileus virginianus clavium) (e.g., Calvo & Silvy 1996), \nIberian lynx (Felis pardina) (Rodriguez & Delibes 1992), as well as European \nbadger in The Netherlands (Van der Zee et al. 1992, Wiertz 1993). Other well-\nknown examples of species heavily affected by road traffic include hedgehog \n(Erinaceus europaeus) (Reichholf & Esser 1981, Holsbreek et al. 1999, Huijser \n2000), otter (Lutra lutra) (Madsen 1990, Philcox et al. 1999), barn owl (Typo \nalba) (Newton et al. 1997) and several other birds of prey (Van der Zande et al. \n1980, Van den Tempel 1993).  \nMany questions arise concerning animal-vehicle collisions. For example, what \ndistinguishes species that are vulnerable to road traffic from those that are not? \nWhen does road mortality become a threat to the survival of a species or its \nmanagement? Finally, how great a loss of individuals should be tolerated \npolitically or ecologically?  \nTo evaluate the significance of road mortality (like any other mortality factor) \nfrom an ecological standpoint, it should be studied in the context of population \ndemography, considering sex- and age-specific mortality and fecundity rates. As a \nrule of thumb, the larger the percentage of road kills on all deaths, the more likely \ntraffic is a \u2018key factor\u2019, unless road mortality is compensated for by increased \nsurvival or fecundity of the remaining individuals, or mainly affects the already \n\u2018doomed surplus\u2019 (Southwood & Henderson 2000). However, most mortality \nfactors, including traffic, are neither completely compensatory nor completely \nadditive. Therefore, the percentage of road kills may eventually produce a \nmisleading picture. Similar to the assessment of a maximum sustainable harvest in \ngame or fish (Robinson & Bodmer 1999, Sutherland 2001), estimation of an \necologically \u2018sustainable\u2019 level of road mortality should relate to population \ngrowth rather than to the size of the population or the proportional kill. A \n\u2018sustainable\u2019 loss takes the interest in population growth and does not affect the \npopulation capital, i.e., the population size. The higher the growth rate, the larger a \nloss can be sustained without changes in population density. If population growth \nrate is already close to stationary, however, even a small uncompensated increase \nin mortality can be significant and provoke a decline of the population (e.g., \nCaughley 1994).  \nThus, species that are sensitive to road mortality are typically slow reproducing \n(low growth rate) and long-lived, whereas species that are most exposed to road \ntraffic are wide-ranging or migratory animals with little or no habitat specialisation \n(Verkaar & Bekker 1991, Forman et al. 2003). These behaviours and life history \ntraits are typical for many medium to large carnivores, and include the European \nbadger (Neal & Cheeseman 1996).  \n 20 \nEffect on badger population dynamics \nBadgers are common throughout Europe (Griffiths & Thomas 1993), and can \nadapt to a variety of environments, such as arid subtropics (Pigozzi 1991, \nRodriguez & Delibes 1992) or cold boreal habitats (Lindstr\u00f6m 1989). They are \nopportunistic in their search for food, and collect rather than hunt their prey, \nwhich, at least in low-productive habitats, links them to agricultural areas and \nhuman settlements, and inevitably, roads. Badgers can range over large areas, \nespecially in low density habitats (Seiler et al. 1995, Rodriguez et al. 1996), and \nare hardly cautious when crossing roads, possibly because they have few natural \nenemies and a limited visual sense (Neal & Cheeseman 1996). In addition, badgers \nare slow reproducing, exhibit delayed implantation, and live in social clans where \nsubordinate females may not be allowed to reproduce (e.g., Neal & Cheeseman \n1996). With their small litter sizes, late maturation, and low adult mortality, \nbadgers resemble more of a large carnivore than the medium-sized opportunist \nthey are considered (e.g., Anderson & Trewhella 1985). Badger population \ndynamics are atypically \u2018slow\u2019 (Heppell et al. 2000) compared to ecologically \nsimilar species such as red fox, raccoon (Procyon lotor), or raccoon dog \n(Nyctereutes procyonoides). \nNot surprisingly, road traffic is a major source of mortality in badgers across \nEurope (Griffiths & Thomas 1993), and in The Netherlands, road traffic is held \nresponsible for a nationwide decline during the 1980\u2019s (Van der Zee et al. 1992). \nReported badger road casualties in The Netherlands during the early 1990\u2019s \naccounted for 10-16% of the summer population, but the total loss, including \nunreported accidents and death of juveniles that lost their mother on a road, \nprobably exceeded 25% (Bekker & Canters 1997), which is more than 50% of the \nannual reproduction (Lankester et al. 1991). In the United Kingdom, local declines \nin badger populations have been attributed to increasing traffic (Clarke et al. \n1998), where road casualties probably amount to over 50,000 individuals annually \nor 20% of the total British population (Harris et al. 1991, Neal & Cheeseman \n1996). Also in Denmark (Aaris-S\u00f6rensen 1995), Spain (Revilla et al. 2001) and \nSweden (paper I), road traffic is a major source of mortality, killing between 10-\n20% of badger populations annually. \nWe evaluated the effect of road mortality on badger population dynamics in \nSweden by estimating a maximum road-kill that the Swedish population can \nsustain without declining provided that road mortality is entirely additive (paper \nII). We simulated population dynamics in an age-specific model based on \npublished estimates on fecundity and mortality (Ahnlund 1980). The model \nsuggested an almost stationary growth rate in the Swedish badger population. \nHarvest statistics over the past two decades seem to support this finding (Swedish \nAssociation for Hunting and Wildlife Management). To measure the effect of road \nmortality on population growth rate and estimate the total number of road kills, we \nsimulated population dynamics under roadless conditions, assuming that no \nbadgers would be hit by cars keeping all other mortality factors constant. For this \ncalculation, we needed information on the contribution of road traffic to the \noverall mortality in badgers and data on age and sex ratios among road kills. \nEstimates of road mortality derived from two independent mark and recapture \nstudies suggesting that between 36% and 50% of all deaths might be due to road 21 \ntraffic. A sample of 76 road-killed badgers collected from public roads during \n2001 and literature data (Ahnlund 1980) indicated a strong bias in age structure \ntowards adults (Figure 4), but no difference in sex ratio or fecundity was found \nbetween the road-killed and modelled (living) populations. Through reducing \nmortality rates with the age-specific contribution of road traffic, we observed that \npopulation growth would increase by 18-22% from the base-line population \nmodel. The results suggested a \u2018maximum sustainable\u2019 loss of 12-13% of the \nliving population, a proportion that is close to the nationwide road-kill estimated \nfrom driver\u2019 interviews in paper I. Although badgers are numerous in Sweden, and \ntraffic intensity is low compared to other European countries, the present level of \nroad mortality in badgers may thus be substantial. Even though some \ncompensation of road mortality will occur, we conclude that nationwide road \ntraffic is probably close to the limit that the Swedish badger population can sustain \nwithout declining. Especially in poorer habitats, such as the boreal coniferous \nforest, population growth may already be limited by road mortality, whereas in \nareas with traffic loads above average, road traffic probably surpasses hunting as \nthe leading cause of death in badgers. Bear in mind, however, that there is reason \nto assume substantial regional variations related to habitat quality and traffic \nintensity. For the protection of badgers, we recommend increased efforts on \ncounteracting measures such as fences and \u2018badger tunnels\u2019 (e.g., Bekker & \nCanters 1997) to reduce badger road mortality in the most critical areas. \n  \n0123456789 1 0\nAge class\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n0.40\n0.45\nP\nr\no\np\no\nr\nt\ni\no\nn\n \na\nm\no\nn\ng\n \np\no\ns\nt\n-\ne\nm\ne\nr\ng\ne\nn\nc\ne\n \nd\ne\na\nt\nh\ns\n model 1 (dx1) \n model 2 (dx2)\n model 3 (dx3)\n \nFigure 4. Proportions of badgers dying during age x as obtained from model 1 assuming \nage independent road mortality (dx1) and from samples of road-kills from model 2 (dx2) and \nmodel 3 (dx3; Ahnlund 1980a). All age distributions are significantly different from each \nother, but the road-killed samples were biased towards a higher proportion of adults and \nfewer juveniles than expected from the base-line model (compare to paper II). 22 \nAn important assumption in our model, however, is that the effect of road \nmortality is entirely additive and not compensated by increased survival or \nfecundity of the remaining individuals. In the real world, of course, compensation \noccurs to a certain degree. For example, badger hunting in Sweden is not regulated \nthrough hunting quota or aiming at a certain quantitative harvest goal. Badger \nhunting is a sport rather than a harvest or management tool. Thus, annual harvest \nis probably linked to badger abundance and thereby indirectly influenced by road \nmortality, i.e., the more badgers that are killed by cars, the fewer can be trapped by \nhunters. If this applies, road and hunting mortalities are compensatory and the \ncritical level of road mortality will be higher than suggested by our model. In its \nextreme, if all hunting would be prohibited, road traffic could kill about twice as \nmany badgers as we assume are killed at present.  \nOn the other hand, collections of road-kills not always provide a representative \nsample of the living population (see also Jahn 1959, Hodson & Snow 1965, Dixon \net al. 1996, paper II). Males or dispersing subadults may be more active and thus \nmore often encounter roads than females or stationary individuals. Young and \ninexperienced animals may be less cautious with traffic, and old and weak animals \nslower in their reactions to approaching vehicles than prime-aged individuals. We \nobserved that the sex ratio among road-killed badgers was skewed towards a \nhigher proportion of females in spring and males in autumn/winter. This probably \nreflects differences in activity and mobility associated with nursing and mating \nbehaviour (e.g., Jefferies 1975, Anderson & Trewhella 1985, Van Apeldoorn \n1997). In addition, the proportion of adult badgers among road kills was \nsignificantly higher than expected from the modelled living population. If these \nindividuals were primarily subdominants or dispersers, their chances of survival as \nwell as their fecundity might be smaller than compared to other adults. In dense \npopulations, the loss of these individuals would have only little effect on \npopulation growth. Under poorer conditions and in small, low-density populations, \nhowever, their relative contribution to population recruitment is pronounced. Also, \nfemale mortality in spring is of particular importance to badger populations \nbecause at this time of year, cubs are still dependent on their mother and most \nadult females are already pregnant. Thus, the loss of a single adult female in spring \nthus can strike three generations in one blow. \nThus, there is reason to believe that road mortality in badgers is partly \ncompensatory; however, the effect probably varies with habitat quality and \npopulation density. In boreal (poor) environments and close to the northern edge \nof their distributional range, badgers may be relatively more sensitive to road \ntraffic than their conspecifics from dense populations and richer habitats in \nsouthern Sweden. Due to the large regional variation in badger density, increased \ntraffic probably first affects the distributional range of badgers (in marginal \nhabitats) before reducing their density in southern (optimal) habitats. \n \nEvaluation in practise \nEvaluating the significance of animal-vehicle collisions should be included in \nenvironmental impact assessment for roads and railroads (Seiler & Eriksson \n1997). Similar to other aspects in EIA studies, evaluation of animal-vehicle 23 \ncollisions requires a clear perspective: What may seem unimportant from one \npoint of view may appear significant if seen from another angle. In most species, \ncollisions with vehicles are a political or ethical issue rather than an ecological \nproblem. The number of collisions may be small and unimportant with respect to \nspecies conservation, but significant from a traffic safety point of view. Likewise, \ncollisions may be unknown to and disregarded by the public but of significant \necological importance. For use in EIA, I propose a simple chain of reasoning that \nranks the different perspectives along a gradient of increasing amount of collisions \nand assists in finding adequate counteractive measures (Figure 4).  \nThe foremost question to be asked is whether the number of collisions can be \nsignificant to the conservation of a species. In red-listed and endangered species \n(G\u00e4rdenfors 2000), any road mortality can be a substantial problem even if it is a \nrare event. According to the new environmental law in Sweden, counteraction or \nat least compensation is obligatory if there is reason to assume a significant impact \non these species. Without the involvement of endangered or rare species, however, \nthere is no legal demand on mitigation, although the impact may still be significant \nto the management of wildlife populations. In situations where road mortality \nexceeds other sources of mortality, traffic and not hunting probably acts as the \nmain regulating factor for a population. In order to determine whether road \nmortality is significant to the conservation or management of a species, the \nfollowing questions should be answered:  \nConservation: \n\u2022  Is the proportion of road-kills large in relation to other sources of \nmortality? \n\u2022  Is road mortality additive? \n\u2022  Do traffic losses approximate population recruitment?  \n\u2022  Is the realized growth rate of the population close to stationary?  \n\u2022  Does road mortality affect individuals that would otherwise enjoy a rather \nhigh chance of survival? \n\u2022  How much reduction in road mortality is needed to reach a level with that \nthe population can sustain? \nManagement: \n\u2022  Are road-kills considered in the annual harvest? \n\u2022  How large are traffic losses compared to the average harvest? \n\u2022  Can harvest goals be adjusted to compensate for traffic losses? \n \nIf road mortality is neither a conservation nor a management problem, then there \nmay still be traffic safety aspects that will limit the acceptable level of collision \nnumbers. In addition, there may be economic profit from mitigation efforts in \nterms of improved traffic flow, reduced train delays, and reduced human injury or \ndamage to private property. Internalization of the external costs of animal-vehicle \ncollisions probably encourages increased mitigation efforts. However, even if \nthere is no economic gain in reducing animal-vehicle collisions, there may still be \nlimitations to the number of accidents assigned by environmental policies or from \nan animal welfare point of view. In practise, it may also be of goodwill to a \nlandowner or public opinion that local mitigation measures are recommendable.  24 \nToday, transport infrastructure is to be an integrated part of our life and this \nincludes the physical as well as the social environment. It is ultimately a question \nof what we want with nature in our environmental goals and visions, rather than to \nfinding the maximum load that the environment can still contend with.  \n \n \nYes\nSpecies conservation\nYes No\nWildlife management\nTraffic safety\nEconomic issues\nPolicy / Politics\nPublic opinion\nNo\nYes No\nYes No\nYes No\nNo Yes\nFulfill legal requirements \non mitigation and \ncompensation, prevent \nroad mortality\nIntegrate road kills \ninto game bag and \nadjust hunting quotas, \nreduce road mortality \nif necessary\nApply counteractive \nmeasures\n(fences, passages, \nspeed reduction), \ninform drivers\nAlternative refunding, \neliminate the most\ncost-intensive issues\nMeet policy goals, \nfind integrated \nsolutions, develop \nagenda, strategic \nplanning\nMeet public discussion, \nshow goodwill No action required ?\nT\no\nl\ne\nr\na\nb\nl\ne\n \na\nm\no\nu\nn\nt\n \no\nf\n \nr\no\na\nd\n \nm\no\nr\nt\na\nl\ni\nt\ny\n \n/\nn\nu\nm\nb\ne\nr\n \no\nf\n \nc\no\nl\nl\ni\ns\ni\no\nn\ns\n \nAnimal-vehicle collisions are a problem to:\n \nFigure 4. Flow chart illustrating possible steps in the evaluation of animal-vehicle \ncollisions. If, under a given situation, animal-vehicle collisions are not a problem to the \nconservation or management of a species, there may very well be traffic safety or economic \nreasons that encourage counteraction. Also environmental policies, including protection of \nbiological diversity, or animal welfare considerations, may set a limit to the maximum \nacceptable number of collisions.  25 \nFactors and patterns in animal-vehicle collisions  \n \nIf the amount of animal-vehicle collisions is considered significant at any of the \nproposed levels (Figure 4), more knowledge is needed about the why, where and \nwhen of the accidents to develop adequate counteractive measures. This can be \napproached from different perspectives: From the viewpoint of the wildlife \nmanager or ecologist, one may ask why the animal enters the road corridor and \nwhat its odds are to cross the road barrier successfully. One may study differences \nin road mortality and collision risks between species and attempt to identify those \nthat are most exposed and sensitive. As a car driver, one may be most interested in \nidentifying where and when the risk to collide with an animal is greatest. One may \nwant to learn how collisions can be avoided, how animals react on the road or can \nbe alerted or scared off as we approach. From a governmental standpoint, \nhowever, it may be more important to understand why certain road sections embed \na greater risk of animal-vehicle collisions than others do. Road planners may need \nto develop tools that can help to predict the probability of \u201cblack spots\u201d \nirrespective of the number of animals and vehicles that pass. Since roads are \nsupposed to last for decades, if not longer, one may need to grasp the wider picture \nand study patterns that are long-term and of a broad scale, instead of attempting to \nanswer the most detailed and local issues.  \nFactors responsible for the occurrence of animal-vehicle collisions can be \nsummarized under three major categories: a) the animal, its ecology and \nbehaviour, b) the traffic, its density and velocity, and c) the environment including \nthe road as well as the surrounding landscape (Table 2). The interplay of these \nfactors creates a complex pattern in the spatial and temporal distribution of \nanimal-vehicle collisions that must be understood before effective counteraction \ncan be designed and employed (e.g., Putman 1997, Forman et al. 2003). Spatial \npatterns may relate to local variations in animal abundance and activity, habitat \ndistribution, landscape topography, and road and traffic characteristics (e.g., \nFeldhamer et al. 1986, Berthoud 1987, Groot-Bruinderink & Hazebroek 1996, \nHubbard et al. 2000, Nielsen et al. 2003, Clevenger et al. 2003). Temporal patterns \nmay reflect seasonal and diurnal variations in traffic volume, weather and light \nconditions, and animal activity associated with e.g., foraging, mating or breeding \nbehaviour (e.g., Davies et al. 1987, Kofler & Schulz 1987, Reh & Seitz 1990, \nJaren et al. 1991, Neal & Cheeseman 1996, Gundersen et al. 1998).  \nI studied trends and spatial patterns in vehicle collisions with ungulates mainly \nfrom a traffic safety and road planning perspective. More specifically, I analyzed \nthe effect of animal abundance and traffic intensity on collision risks in order to \ndevelop predictive models. At broad scales, harvest statistics served as an index of \nanimal abundance and provided the most powerful predictor of collision numbers. \nLocally, however, environmental factors, such as habitat distribution or road \nfeatures, more reliably predicted the risk for accidents. Answering the where and \nwhen of animal-vehicle collisions seems, therefore, to be a matter of scale.  \n \n 26 \nTable 2.

Various studies have confirmed that \nbroad-scaled patterns in distribution of animal-vehicle collisions reflect variations \nin animal abundance and, to a lesser degree, traffic volume (e.g., Carbaugh et al. \n1975, Kofler & Schulz 1987, Oosenbrug et al. 1991). McCaffery (1973), for \nexample, observed significant correlations between numbers of collisions with \nwhite-tailed deer and antlered buck harvest in 28 of 29 management areas in \nWisconsin, USA. Puglisi et al. (1974) reported positive relationships between \ncounty deer population estimates and collision numbers among 15 counties in \nPennsylvania. Similarly, I found strong correlations between densities of ungulate-\nvehicle collisions and average annual harvests among 22 Swedish counties as well \nas among moose hunting districts within counties (paper III). The significant \nchange in ungulate-vehicle collisions that occurred in Sweden over the past 3 \ndecades could also be attributed to increasing ungulate densities (Figure 5; paper \nIII). Harvest statistics, as an index to ungulate abundance, were the primary \ncorrelate with collision numbers at national level, whereas the steadily increasing \ntraffic explained a significant part of the residual variation and kept collision \nnumbers at a high level while population sizes declined.  \nThe strong relationship between animal-vehicle collisions and harvest data may \nsuggest that trends and patterns in accident numbers could be predicted from \nharvest statistics. However, this conclusion applies only at broad scales and only \nto species in which harvest directly reflects population density and stands for a \nmajor part of the total mortality. Several authors have criticized the use of harvest \ndata as an index of population density, especially since other estimation methods \nsuch as hunter observations or pellet counts more accurately reflect population \npatterns at finer scales (e.g., Ericsson & Wallin 1999, Solberg & Saether 1999, but \nsee Fuller 1991). In species such as the moose, in which hunting is regulated 27 \nthrough licences and in which management goals aim at balancing harvest against \nenvironmental, social, and economic constraints, game bag statistics may not \nrelate to population density at all (e.g., Sylv\u00e9n 2003). In addition, hunting licenses \nfor moose in Sweden are usually based on previous years\u2019 harvest and population \nestimates. The attempt to balance moose densities can delay harvest-based \npopulation indices with one or two years compared to the actual development of \nthe population (e.g., Cederlund & Markgren 1987). Indeed, I observed a time lag \nof 2 years between annual moose harvests and moose-vehicle collisions at a \nnational level, but no time lag in the relationship for roe deer, in which hunting is \nnot license-based (paper III).  \n \n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nRoe deer\n0123456\nAnnual harvest (per 1000 ha)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nC\no\nl\nl\ni\ns\ni\no\nn\ns\n \np\ne\nr\n \n1\n0\n0\n \nk\nm\n \nr\no\na\nd\n \na\nn\nd\n \ny\ne\na\nr\nMoose\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nRoe deer\n0123456\nAnnual harvest (per 1000 ha)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nC\no\nl\nl\ni\ns\ni\no\nn\ns\n \np\ne\nr\n \n1\n0\n0\n \nk\nm\n \nr\no\na\nd\n \na\nn\nd\n \ny\ne\na\nr\nMoose\n \nFigure 5. Relationship between the average frequencies of police-reported ungulate-vehicle \ncollisions and average annual harvest in moose and roe deer among Swedish counties \nduring 1985 to 1999. In moose: R\u00b2=0.598, F(1,20)=29.787, p<0.0001; in roe deer: \nR\u00b2=0.568, F(1,20)=26.297 p<0.0001.  \n 28 \nFurthermore, measures of animal density usually refer to comparatively large \nareas, encompassing many individuals\u2019 home ranges or even management units. \nAt a local scale though, they will fail to produce an adequate picture of the \nabundance of individuals. Animal-vehicle collisions are spatially and temporally \naggregated (e.g., Bashore et al. 1985, Hartwig 1993, Finder et al. 1999, Hubbard \net al. 2000, Madsen et al. 2002). This implies that patterns observed at a broad \nscale may not apply at a finer scale (O'Neill et al. 1986, paper III), which is \npartially due partly to an emerging influence of local factors, partially to an \nincreased variance and error, and partially to a scale-dependency in the parameters \nstudied. Consequently, different criteria need to be studied to understand the \npattern at different scales. For local risk assessment, measures of animal \nmovement and activity will thus be more appropriate than any density measure. In \npart, these can be derived from knowledge about the species\u2019 habitat utilisation \nand distribution of preferred habitat in the landscape (paper III).  \n \nTraffic intensity \nThe second category of factors influencing numbers and likelihood of animal-\nvehicle collisions is related to traffic density and vehicle speed. Increasing traffic \nhas been held responsible for the growing number of animal-vehicle collisions \nworldwide (e.g., Forman & Alexander 1998). Trend analyses and comparisons of \nfield inventories made during different decades seem to support this idea (e.g., \nJonkers & De Vries 1977, Hansen 1982, Van den Tempel 1993, Newton et al. \n1997, paper I). I observed that the increase in traffic intensity in Sweden over the \npast 30 years explained well the deviation between trends in ungulate harvest and \nungulate-vehicle collisions (paper III). Also in other species (Figure 2), the \nincrease in the ratio of collisions to harvest may partially be attributed to \nincreasing traffic.  \nHowever, the effect of traffic on animal-vehicle collisions is not necessarily \nlinear and can be confounded by population dynamics, animal behaviour, spatial \nand temporal factors, as well as the scale of observation (e.g., Groot-Bruinderink \n& Hazebroek 1996). For example, studies on amphibians (Van Gelder 1973, Kuhn \n1987), small mammals and birds (Oxley et al. 1974), carnivores (Clarke et al. \n1998, Rosell Pag\u00e8s & Velasco Rivas 1999), and ungulates (Sk\u00f6lving 1987, \nBerthoud 1987, paper IV) showed a higher density of collisions on intermediate \nroads than on major highways or on local access roads. Similarly, I found the \nhighest frequencies of moose-vehicle collisions in Sweden on unfenced roads with \na speed limit of 90 km/h and a traffic volume of between 4,000-6,000 vehicles per \naverage day (paper IV). Significantly fewer collisions occurred on minor county \nroads with reduced speed limits and on unfenced highways with traffic denser than \n8,000 vehicles per day and a speed limit of 100 km/h (Figure 6).  \nThese observations suggest that at low traffic volumes, animals may not waver \nto enter a roadway but only few may collide with vehicles while attempting to \ncross. With increased traffic, more animals will be killed while trying to cross a \nroad. On very busy roads, however, approaching animals will more likely be \nrepelled by traffic noise or vehicle movement, which leaves fewer to be run over \nand reduces the fraction of successful individuals. This interaction between 29 \nmortality risk and repellence produces a barrier effect that increases exponentially \nwith traffic volume (Figure 7). Busy highways and large motorways should \ntherefore be considered as an insurmountable barrier to most terrestrial \nvertebrates. For practical use in road planning, traffic levels above 10,000 vehicles \nper day have been proposed as a critical level for considering roads as an effective \nbarrier (e.g., Reck & Kaule 1993, M\u00fcller & Berthoud 1997, Rosell Pag\u00e8s & \nVelasco Rivas 1999).  \n \nA) \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n50 km/h 70 km/h 90 km/h 110 km/h\nSpeed limitation\nM\nV\nC\n \np\ne\nr\n \n1\n0\n0\n \nk\nm\n \na\nn\nd\n \ny\ne\na\nr model-area\ntest-area\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n50 km/h 70 km/h 90 km/h 110 km/h\nSpeed limitation\nM\nV\nC\n \np\ne\nr\n \n1\n0\n0\n \nk\nm\n \na\nn\nd\n \ny\ne\na\nr model-area\ntest-area\n \nB) \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n<2000 2000-\n4000\n4000-\n6000\n6000-\n8000\n>8000\nAverage no. of vehicles per day\nM\nV\nC\n \np\ne\nr\n \n1\n0\n0\n \nk\nm\n \na\nn\nd\n \ny\ne\na\nr\nmodel-area\ntest-area\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n<2000 2000-\n4000\n4000-\n6000\n6000-\n8000\n>8000\nAverage no. of vehicles per day\nM\nV\nC\n \np\ne\nr\n \n1\n0\n0\n \nk\nm\n \na\nn\nd\n \ny\ne\na\nr\nmodel-area\ntest-area\n \nFigure 6.

Conceptual model on the effect of traffic volume on the percentage of animals \nthat successfully cross a road, are repelled by traffic noise and vehicle movement, or get \nkilled as they attempt to cross. The model is based on empirical data indicating that most \ncollisions occur on intermediate roads (compare to Berthoud 1987, Sk\u00f6lving 1987, M\u00fcller \n& Berthoud 1997, paper IV).  \n \nOnce an animal has taken a step onto the road, the risk of colliding with vehicles \nwill increase with traffic volume, vehicle speed, road width, and the presence of \nobstacles such as gullies or central wire railings that slow down animals or prevent \ntheir exit from the road. Clearly, mobile animals may have a greater chance to slip \nbetween cars on a trafficked road than slow moving species. Mader (1981) \nsuggested that the chance of survival increases logarithmically with the velocity of \nthe animal, i.e., the faster the animal, the greater the chance to escape from a road \nbefore the next vehicle arrives. Hels & Buchwald (2001) calculated collision risks \nfor amphibians and small mammals as the product of animal speed, vehicle width, \ntraffic density, and the angle at which the animal crosses the road (i.e., a measure \nof road width). Their model suggested that traffic volumes of less than 4,000 \nvehicles per average day might kill most amphibians trying to cross a road, \nwhereas the mortality risk for faster species, such as small mammals, may only be \nmarginal. Field observations lend support to this notion, for example, traffic \ndensities of 60 cars/h can kill more than 90% of female toads (Bufo bufo) \nmigrating across roads (Van Gelder 1973). However, these models do not account \nfor differences in flight or defensive behaviour among animals. Animals that are \naware of moving vehicles or even recognize the danger may be able to avoid \ncollisions although they move slowly. For the driver of a car, on the other hand, it \nmay be easier to avoid a frog resting on the road than a hare that tries to run away \nfrom the vehicle making abrupt turns and stops.  \nFor the planning of roads, however, it may be most important to understand the \nrelationship between traffic parameters and the actual frequency of collisions with \nwildlife. In paper IV, I describe that the probability of moose-vehicle collisions 31 \nincreased logarithmically with traffic volume and vehicle speed: Roads with low \ntraffic volumes but high speed limits embedded the highest risk of accidents. \nReduction of vehicle speed appeared as the most effective measure to reduce \ncollision risks (Figure 6).  \n \nEnvironmental factors \nAnimal-vehicle collisions are most likely to occur where trafficked roads run \nthrough or between preferred wildlife habitats, or where roads and roadsides \nprovide attractive resources to wildlife. Forest habitat, for example, is an important \nprerequisite for deer-vehicle accidents in Austria (Kofler & Schulz 1987), France \n(Berthoud 1987), in the USA in Illinois (Finder et al. 1999), Iowa (Hubbard et al. \n2000), and Pennsylvania (Puglisi et al. 1974, Bashore et al. 1985), as well as in \nSweden (Almkvist et al. 1980). Moist forests, young pine plantations, and clear \ncuts with high proportion of deciduous vegetation provide important staple forage \nfor moose in Sweden (e.g., Bergstr\u00f6m & Hjeljord 1987, Cederlund & Okarma \n1988, Faber & Lavsund 1999), whereas roe deer preferably feed on grasses and \nherbs in more open habitats (Cederlund et al. 1980). Accordingly, I observed that \nmoose-vehicle collisions were more frequent in areas with high proportions of \nforest and wetland, while the numbers of collisions with roe deer were increased \nin rural (open and agricultural) habitats (paper III). The probability of moose-\nvehicle collisions also depended on the distance to the nearest forest cover and the \namount of forest in proximity to a road (paper IV). The model predicted that an \nincrease of 100 m in distance to the nearest forest can reduce collision risks by \n15% (paper IV).  \nA Spanish study on vertebrate mortality on roads suggested that environmental \nmeasures and habitat quality had a much higher effect on the species-specific \nfrequency of fauna casualties than road features (Gonzalez-Prieto et al. 1993). The \nhighest collision frequencies occurred in undisturbed areas, whereas fewer took \nplace close to human habitations where wildlife habitat was of lower quality and \nanimal densities were reduced. Similarly, in Sweden, G\u00f6ransson et al. (1978) \nobserved increased frequencies of road killed mammals and birds in urban \n(suburban) and forest habitats compared to in open, agricultural areas, a pattern \nwhich reflects differences in population densities between these habitats.  \nThe effect of habitat on collision risks, however, depends also on the \ncomposition of the wider landscape and the juxtaposition of the road relative to \nimportant landscape elements. Where the preferred habitat is extensive and \ncommon, animal-vehicle accident sites tend to be more randomly distributed (e.g., \nAllen & McCullough 1976, Bashore et al. 1985). Where the favourable habitat is \npatchy and coincides with infrastructure, and where linear landscape features such \nas riparian corridors, fence rows or other transport infrastructure funnel animals \nalongside or across a roadway, collision risks will locally be increased and \naccident sites more aggregated (e.g., Feldhamer et al. 1986, Kofler & Schulz 1987, \nLehnert et al. 1996, Lod\u00e9 2000, Nielsen et al. 2003, Clevenger et al. 2003).  \nTraffic casualties in otters (Lutra lutra), for example, were most likely to occur \nwhere roads cross over watercourses along which otters move (e.g., Philcox et al. 32 \n1999). The probability for deer-vehicle collisions in Illinois, USA, is significantly \nincreased where public recreational land near roads and the presence of adjacent \ngullies and riparian travel corridors is intersected by roads (Finder et al. 1999). \nHubbard et al. (2000) observed that the likelihood for accidents with white-tailed \ndeer was increased where highways bridged over (riparian) travel corridors for \ndeer. Also, where exclusion fences terminate or are interrupted by interchanges \nand connecting infrastructure, collision risk will be increased (e.g., Ward 1982, \nFeldhamer et al. 1986, Clevenger et al. 2001). Road kills in Dutch hedgehogs, for \nexample, were more likely to occur where railway corridors, along which \nhedgehogs foraged, intersected with trafficked roads (Huijser 2000). In Denmark, \nmore road-killed foxes and roe deer were found near interchanges than elsewhere \nalong the studied highways (Madsen et al. 1998). This was explained by the \ndesign of interchanges, including the extent of forestation and fencing between the \nroads that attracts but traps animals in the road junction. Similarly, I observed that \nthe risk of moose-vehicle collisions was increased where private roads connected \nto highways (paper IV). This may probably be due to moose using minor roads as \ntravel corridors. However, where private roads connected to bridges or tunnels \nproviding a safe passage, collisions occurred less frequently (paper III).  \nIn addition, temporal factors also may influence the effect of habitat and \nlandscape composition on collision risks. The work of Almkvist et al. (1980), for \nexample, suggested that during daylight the risk for moose-vehicle collisions in \nforested areas was four times greater than in open habitats, whereas the risk during \nnight was about the same in both habitat types. Studies on moose-train collisions \nin Norway demonstrated strong interactions of temporal and spatial factors such as \nlunar phase, snow cover, temperature, and time of day in determining collision \nsites (e.g., Andersen et al. 1991, Gundersen & Andreassen 1998, Gundersen et al. \n1998). \n 33 \nMitigation against animal-vehicle collisions  \n \nVarious measures to counteract animal-vehicle collisions have been tested through \nthe years, yet only few have proven effective (Reed & Ward 1987, Romin & \nBissonette 1996, Putman 1997, Forman et al. 2003). Most counteractive measures \nimplemented today seek to prevent animals from crossing a road (by means of \nfences, gullies, reflectors, and olfactory or acoustical repellents) or to reduce their \npresence in the road corridor (by means of roadside clearance, additional feeding \nor salt lick sites, and population control) (e.g., M\u00fcller & Berthoud 1997, Keller et \nal. 2003). Only exceptionally attempts have been made to alter traffic patterns by \nreduced speed limits or by temporary road closing, or even to adjust road schemes \nas to avoid high-risk areas (Keller et al. 2003). Measures aimed at increasing the \nawareness of a driver by means of warning signs or public education are also used, \nyet mostly in relation to larger animals (e.g., Romin & Bissonette 1996). \n \nDriver\nRoad\nLandowner\nVehicle\nEnvironment \nAnimal\nAuthority\nSpeed\nT\nr\na\nf\nf\ni\nc\n \nRoad corridor Landscape\nP\no\np\nu\nl\na\ni\nt\no\nn\nBehaviour\n \nFigure 8. Factors that influence the occurrence of animal-vehicle collisions can be \nattributed to the vehicle, the animal, and their environment, including the road corridor and \nsurrounding landscape. They relate to the partial responsibilities of the driver, road \nauthority, and wildlife manager/landowner in counteracting collisions. Effective mitigation \nconcepts need to involve all three perspectives.  \n \nTypically, mitigation measures against animal-vehicle collisions aim at \nincreasing human traffic safety rather than reducing road mortality to wildlife \n(e.g., Forman et al. 2003, Keller et al. 2003). This anthropocentric perspective \nusually views the animal as the intruder on the road, without realising that it is the \nroad and its traffic that have encroached on an animal\u2019s habitat in the first place. \nRecently, a new mitigation approach has been proposed that considers fences and \nother counteractive measures as part of an integrated \u2018landscape permeability and \ntraffic safety concept\u2019 that aims at remedying habitat fragmentation due to \ntransport infrastructure in the same way as it increases traffic safety (Keller & 34 \nBekker 2003). Counteracting animal-vehicle collisions thereby calls for \nintegration of road design, traffic regulation, and land use and thus addresses all \nthree actors involved in animal-vehicle collisions: The animal, the driver, and the \nroad with its traffic (Figure 8). Thus, responsibilities for counteracting animal-\nvehicle collisions are in part with the road authority (who decides about road \nlocalisation, design and traffic velocity), the driver (who determines the actual \ntravel speed and can avoid animals in time), and the landowner or wildlife \nmanager (who influences distribution of wildlife habitat relative to a road and \nthereby affects animal movements and abundances).  \n \nExclusion fences \nAmong the various mitigation measures against ungulate-vehicle collisions that \nhave been tested on Swedish roads since the 1970\u2019s (e.g., Anonymous 1980, \nBj\u00f6rnstig et al. 1986, Sk\u00f6lving 1987, Lavsund & Sandegren 1991), only exclusion \nfencing and roadside clearing have proven to work efficiently. Small-scale \nexperiments suggested that fencing can reduce the rate of accidents with moose \nlocally by more than 80%, and with roe deer by up to 55%, while the clearance of \nforested roadsides from palatable or attractive forage for ungulates may result in a \n20% reduction in ungulate-vehicle collisions (Almkvist et al. 1980, Sk\u00f6lving \n1985, Nilsson 1987). I also observed that the presence of fences significantly \nreduced the probability of moose-vehicle collisions per km road (Figure 9). \nTogether with traffic volume and vehicle speed, fencing appeared as the dominant \nroad factor determining collision risks (paper IV).  \nFencing and roadside clearance have become a standard in Swedish road \nmanagement. More than 5,000 km of roads or approximately 34% of motorways \nand national roads have been fenced during the past 25 years, and recent traffic \nsafety policy aims at a significant extension of mitigation fencing (A. Sj\u00f6lund, \nSNRA, pers. comm.). Nevertheless, the overall effect of fencing on the numbers of \ncollisions is probably only marginal: About half of all collisions recorded since \n1975 occurred on national roads. If all fences were equally efficient (80% \neffective in moose and 55% effective in roe deer, see above) and all other factors \ninfluencing animal-vehicle collisions were held constant over time, we may expect \na 13.6% reduction in risk for moose-vehicle collisions, and a 9.4% reduction in \nrisk for roe deer collisions nationwide over the past 25 years. These numbers, \nhowever, are smaller than the observed year-to-year variation in collision numbers \nand thus cannot be confirmed from accident statistics.  \nIt seems obvious that a complete reduction in animal-vehicle collisions can only \nbe achieved by erecting impermeable barriers that separate animals and vehicles. \nSuch measures, however, are costly and only economically beneficial on high-\nspeed roads where the risk for human injury in animal-vehicle collisions is \nsubstantial. On minor roads with intermediate speed limits, there is less economic \ngain for road authorities to erect wildlife-proof fences, although the number of \ncollisions with animals may be considerably higher than on high-speed roads \n(Figure 6, paper IV). This implies that in order to reduce collision numbers \n(instead of the severity of accidents), a larger proportion of intermediate roads \nshould be fenced.  35 \n \nP\nr\no\nb\na\nb\ni\nl\ni\nt\ny\n \nf\no\nr\n \nM\nV\nC\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n012345\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n012345 012345 012345\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n50 km/h\n70 km/h\n90 km/h\n110 km/h\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n50 km/h\n70 km/h\n90 km/h\n110 km/h\n50 km/h\n70 km/h\n90 km/h\n110 km/h\nMoose harvest per 1000 ha land area\nFencing\nFencing\nRoad \nclearance\n100 m\nFencing\nFencing\nRoad \nclearance\n100 m\n \nA) Combined model \n \n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n012345678\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n012345678\nP\nr\no\nb\na\nb\ni\nl\ni\nt\ny\n \nf\no\nr\n \nM\nV\nC\n012345678 012345678\nMean traffic in 1000 vehicles per day\nFencing\n \nB) Traffic model \n \nFigure 9.

B) Predictions of the \ntraffic model with intercepts forced through the origin. \n \n 36 \nExtended fencing, on the other hand, increases the risk of isolation effects on \nwildlife and may even reduce the efficacy of fences as animals determined to cross \na road may force a barrier and eventually break through (Nilsson 1987, Seiler et \nal. 2003). Fences too short, however, may not actually reduce the risk for \naccidents but only shift the problem towards the end of the fences (e.g., Ward \n1982, Foster & Humphrey 1995, Clevenger et al. 2001). In addition, economic \nconstraints in planning and design may result in suboptimal fences that are only \npartially effective and pretend to provide a higher road safety than they actually \ndo. Wallentinus (2000), for example, reported from a 15-year monitoring study \nalong a partially fenced road segment in Sweden that moose accidents were \nactually more common on a fenced road stretch than on an unfenced part. In paper \nIII, I describe that density of moose-vehicle collisions within Swedish parishes \nwas not affected by amount of fencing, but occurrence of conventional road \nbridges that may provide alternative passage to moose, and this, in turn, did reduce \ncollision frequencies.  \n \nFauna passages \nTo counteract isolation and further increase traffic safety, SNRA now \nrecommends combining road fences with passages especially adapted to wildlife at \nlocations where collisions are most frequent or the need for continued wildlife \nmovement is high. Such locations may exist where fences terminate and linear \nlandscape elements and topographic features funnel animals across the roadway \n(e.g., Bashore et al. 1985, Feldhamer et al. 1986, Bennett 1991, Lehnert et al. \n1996, Madsen et al. 1998, Finder et al. 1999, Hubbard et al. 2000). Exact \nlocalisation and adapted design of wildlife passages appeared to be crucial \nrequisites in determining their usage by wildlife (e.g., Olbrich 1984, Clevenger & \nWaltho 2000, Keller & Bekker 2003). However, various observations confirmed \nthat even conventional road bridges and tunnels may provide passage to wildlife \nand thereby reduce the likelihood of animals crossing roads at-grate (e.g., Yanes et \nal. 1995, Rodriguez et al. 1996, Clevenger & Waltho 2000). Ongoing field studies \nsuggest that the size and openness of road underpasses positively affects usage by \nroe deer or moose, whereas badgers and foxes seem to prefer narrower passages \n(A. Seiler, unpubl. data). Snow tracking data from a fenced highway in northern \nSweden (Seiler et al. 2003), for instance, illustrated that moose were reluctant to \nenter narrow road underpasses and instead chose to charge a highway fence with \nthe consequent risk for collisions with vehicles. Similarly, Hubbard et al. (2000) \nobserved that the likelihood for accidents with white-tailed deer in Iowa, USA, \nwas increased where roads bridged over travel corridors for deer. The authors \nbelieved that deer did not accept these conventional passages and instead chose to \ncross over the road.  \nNevertheless, I found that in Sweden the risk for moose-vehicle collisions \ndecreased where tunnels or bridges separated intersecting roads. The density of \nroad passages had a significant effect on density of collisions with moose and roe \ndeer per parish (paper III). Where private roads directly connected to a main road \nbut bridges or tunnels were absent, however, the risk for moose-vehicle collisions \nwas elevated, irrespective of whether this road was fenced or not (paper IV).  37 \nIt remains to be investigated how efficient conventional road bridges or tunnels \nare compared to adapted wildlife passages. It is possible that even small changes \nin design and width of conventional passages could provide sufficient efficiency to \nreduce isolation effects and increase traffic safety. Recommendations for \nminimum dimensions of adapted wildlife passages have been proposed earlier. For \nexample, Olbrich (1984) concluded from field inventories on 788 bridges and \ntunnels in Western Germany that effective wildlife passages should exceed a \nrelative width (width*height/length) of 0.75 for roe deer and 1.5 for red deer \n(Cervus elaphus) and fallow deer (Dama dama). These minimum requirements are \nnot far from standard dimensions used for conventional road underpasses. In \npractise, it seems more likely to find support for the adaptation (enlargement) of \nconventional road underpasses and bridges than for the construction of passages \nexclusively designated to wildlife (e.g., Keller & Bekker 2003).  \n \nReduced animal density \nAnother, rather compelling but little discussed, mitigation option is the reduction \nof animal populations in the vicinity of roads. The observed relationship between \ncollision numbers and harvest statistics in, e.g., ungulates (paper III) suggests that \nintensive population control might reduce the number of animal-vehicle collisions \n(e.g., Keller et al. 2003).  \nCertainly, large-scale reductions in animal densities may have a counteractive \neffect on collision risks, but it will be difficult to find political and public support \nfor such action even if the species is abundant and widespread. Local reductions, \non the other hand, are more easily achieved, but may not necessarily give the \ndesired effect. In their survey of mitigation measures applied across the United \nStates, Romin & Bissonette (1996) reported that only one of two states that tried to \nreduce deer-vehicle collisions through intensified hunting indicated success. \nAlmkvist et al. (1980), for example, expressed doubt as to whether local \nmanagement for reduced moose density would decrease the frequency of moose-\nvehicle collisions. Joyce & Mahoney (2001) observed that numbers of moose-\nvehicle collisions along the Trans-Canada Highway in Newfoundland were \nelevated in areas of both very scarce and very dense moose populations. I found \nno correlation between annual moose harvest and density of moose-vehicle \ncollisions among parishes, but instead a significant influence of road density, \nforest habitat and occurrence of underpasses and bridges (paper III). \nAs discussed before, it is an animals\u2019 activity and mobility rather than the \ndensity of the population that influences risks for collisions with vehicles locally. \nLocal density reduction alongside roads, however, would perturb population \nstructure, distort established territories, and thereby increase an animals\u2019 mobility. \nReduced densities in otherwise attractive habitats may further provoke \nimmigration by inexperienced dispersers that are more likely to attempt to cross a \nroad and collide with vehicles. Thus, a local reduction in animal density may only \ngive a momentary effect, or even increase the risk for collisions.  \nIn conclusion, I know of no empirical study that has yet been published on the \npreceding question; however, there is anecdotal data on moose-vehicle collisions 38 \nin Sweden lending support to the assumption. For example, collisions with moose \ntend to be most frequent during the first years after construction of a new road but \nlessen after 2-3 years. Also, problems with animals forcing entry through a road \nfence seem to occur mainly during the first two to three years after a fence has \nbeen raised (Kjell St\u00e5hl, SNRA, pers. comm.). This seems probable because \nresident moose may either be killed (due to the new road dissecting their home \nranges; e.g., Reilly & Green 1974, Jones 2000) or gradually adapt their \nmovements to the new road or fence and learn to cope with traffic and the risk of \ncollision \u2013 at least to some degree.  \n \n \nConclusions \n \nAnimal-vehicle collisions are a common phenomenon worldwide, causing injury \nor death to millions of animals and hundreds of human passengers each year (e.g., \nRomin & Bissonette 1996, Groot-Bruinderink & Hazebroek 1996, Forman et al. \n2003). Studying and mitigating animal-vehicle collisions can be empowered as \npart of traffic safety programs or in the context of habitat fragmentation or wildlife \nmanagement, but for complete success, a holistic approach that addresses both \ndrivers and animals in their shared (road) environment is needed. In fact, in many \ncases, animal-vehicle collisions are not primarily a conservation problem but must \nbe dealt with from a political and ethical standpoint. Thus, it is not solely in the \nhand of an engineer, economist, or ecologist to judge whether counteraction is \nnecessary. Instead, there is need for interdisciplinary co-operation to develop \nadequate, goal-efficient mitigation concepts.  \nIn Sweden, most wildlife species are not immediately threatened by today\u2019s road \ntraffic. Mitigation measures are therefore focused primarily on increasing traffic \nsafety for humans. Game management is another important factor stimulating the \nimplementation of counteractive measures such as wildlife passages. In some \nspecies, for instance the badger, hunting is probably overtaken by road traffic as \nthe major cause of mortality. Road mortality is especially harmful to species with \nslow reproduction and low population densities. Regional differences in habitat \nquality and dispersion can produce large variation in the significance of road \ntraffic to population dynamics. Thus, although nationwide road-kill estimates may \nappear to be within acceptable levels, impacts at a regional or local scale can be \nsubstantial.  \nAt present, neither the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency nor animal \nwelfare organisations have yet become aware of, or seem to be interested in, this \nissue. Nevertheless, animal-vehicle collisions are now considered as an integrated \npart of the ecological impact of infrastructure and thereby subject to proposed \nenvironmental quality goals of the transport sector. Statistics on animal-vehicle \ncollisions can provide a useful tool to quantify and evaluate environmental \nimpacts of transport infrastructure as well as to monitor trends in wildlife \npopulations.  39 \nIf counteraction is required (or desired), more knowledge about spatial and \ntemporal factors determining collisions risks are needed. I showed that the local \nrisk for collisions with moose, for example, can be predicted reasonably well from \nremotely sensed landscape data and official road traffic data. The spatial and \ntemporal clumping of animal-vehicle collisions implies, however, that patterns \nobserved at one scale may not apply at another scale. Local pattern may not \nsupport a general conclusion, while broad-scale dependencies and trends may tell \nrelatively little about relationships at a local level. In addition, a correlation \nbetween animal density, traffic intensity and collision numbers seems convincing, \nwhile a dose-effect relationship may be curvilinear or even reversed. Since \nresearch on animal-vehicle collisions should address both humans and animals, \ninvestigations should also be at multiple scales.  \nTypically, mitigation measures against animal-vehicle collisions seek to prevent \nanimals from entering a roadway. Fences, warning reflectors, scent repellents, and \nwildlife passages have been used to guarantee unobstructed, safe roads to drivers. \nHowever, it seems it is usually a vehicle that strikes an animal. The significance of \nvehicle speed in models on moose-vehicle collisions, for example, underlined the \nimportance of responsibility by an individual driver. With better knowledge on \nrisk distribution and adequate preventive behaviour, many drivers might be able to \navoid colliding with animals. To achieve effective mitigation against animal-\nvehicle collisions, there is clearly a need for a holistic approach that includes an \nintegrated management of surrounding landscapes (directing animal movements), \nof roads (creating barriers and passages), of animal populations (protection of \nresident animals near roads), as well as a better understanding of driver behaviour \n(awareness and responsible driving).  40 \nReferences  \n \nAaris-S\u00f6rensen, J. 1995.

Of the ten leading causes\nof disability worldwide, five are psychiatric conditions: unipolar depression,\nalcohol use, bipolar affective disorder (manic depression), schizophrenia\nand obsessive-compulsive disorder.1\nThe burden of mental disorders on health and productivity throughout the\nworld has long been profoundly underestimated.2 The impact of mental\nhealth problems in the workplace has serious consequences not only for the\nindividuals whose lives are influenced either directly or indirectly, but also\nfor enterprise productivity. Mental health problems strongly influence\nemployee performance, rates of illnesses, absenteeism, accidents, and staff\nturnover.\nThe workplace is an appropriate environment in which to educate and\nraise individuals\u2019 awareness about mental health problems.  For example,\nencouragement to promote good mental health practices, provide tools for\nrecognition and early identification of the symptoms of problems, and\nestablish links with local mental health services for referral and treatment\ncan be offered.  The need to demystify the topic and lift the taboos about\nthe presence of mental health problems in the workplace while educating\nthe working population regarding early recognition and treatment will\nbenefit employers in terms of higher productivity and reduction in direct\nand in-direct costs.  However, it must be recognised that some mental\nhealth problems need specific clinical care and monitoring, as well as spe-\ncial considerations for the integration or re-integration of the individual\ninto the workforce.\nWhy should the ILO be involved?\nMental illness constitutes one of the world\u2019s most critical and socialhealth problems.  It affects more human lives and wastes more\nhuman resources than any other disabling condition.3 The ILO\u2019s activities\npromote the inclusion of persons with physical, psychiatric and intellectu-\nal disabilities into mainstream training and employment structures.  \nThe ILO\u2019s primary goals regarding disability are to prepare and empower\npeople with disabilities to pursue their employment goals and facilitate\naccess to work and job opportunities in open labour markets, while sensi-\ntising policy makers, trade unions and employers to these issues.  The\nILO\u2019s mandate on disability issues is specified in the ILO Convention 159\n(1983) on vocational rehabilitation and employment.  No. 159 defines a dis-\nabled person as an individual whose prospects of securing, retaining, and\nadvancing in suitable employment are substantially reduced as a result of\na duly recognised physical or mental impairment. The Convention estab-\nlished the principle of equal treatment and employment for workers with\ndisabilities.\nMost recently, the ILO has recognised the need to promote increased\ninvestment in human resource development, which can help support\nemployment productivity and growth.  This focus pays particular attention\nto the human resource needs of vulnerable groups, which include individu-\ni\nIn the ILO study,\nMental health in the\nworkplace, situation\nanalyses of Finland,\nGermany, Poland,\nthe UK and the USA\nprovide in-depth\nassessments of the\nimpact of mental\nhealth concerns in\nthe workplace to\ndetermine the scope\nof the problem in\nthe open labour\nmarket.  \nIn Germany, the var-\nious social partners,\ni.e., the government,\nnon-governmental\norganisations,\nemployees\u2019 and\nemployers\u2019 organi-\nsations, and institu-\ntions responsible for\nhealth and safety in\nthe workplace, have\npaid great attention\nto job-related stress\nand its impact on\nthe work environ-\nment.\nals with mental health problems.  As pointed out, employee mental health\nproblems and their impact on an enterprise\u2019s productivity and disability\ncosts are a critical human resource issue.  Increasingly, employers, employ-\ners\u2019 organisations and international organisational bodies are recognising\nthat the economic and social costs of mental health problems in the work-\nplace cannot be ignored.\nThe purpose of the research\nWith a grant from the Eli Lilly and Company Foundation, the ILOconducted in-depth situation analyses in five countries.  The five coun-\ntries selected were Finland, Germany, Poland, UK, and USA.  The primary\npurpose of these situation analyses was to conduct an in-depth assessment\nof the impact of mental health problems in the workplace in order to deter-\nmine the scope of the problem in competitive employment.  Related to this\npurpose was also the assessment of the specific ramifications of the impact\nof mental health problem for employees and enterprises such as workplace\nproductivity, loss of income, health-care and social security costs, access to\nmental health services and good practices by employers.\nAn essential objective of these situation analyses is that the information col-\nlected and assessed may be used to create further educational materials and\nassist in designing programmes which can be used by governmental agen-\ncies, unions, and employers\u2019 organisations for mental health promotion, pre-\nvention, and rehabilitation.\nThe situation analyses were based primarily on a thorough literature\nreview, including documents from government agencies, NGOs, employer\nand employee organisations, as well as interviews with key informants.  \nThe case of Germany\nIt has been reported that, in Germany, depression, and in particular majordepression is ten times more frequent today than it was 50 years ago.\nThere is also an increasing recognition of the impact of job related stress on\nthe work environment.  \u201cBurnout\u201d is viewed as a serious problem, poten-\ntially affecting many workers, which is directly related to job stressors.  In\nGermany, the various social partners, i.e., the government, non-governmen-\ntal organisations, employees\u2019 and employers\u2019 organisations, and institutions\nresponsible for health and safety in the workplace, have paid great attention\nto job-related stress and its impact on the work environment.  For many\nyears, successful prevention programmes have already been in place in\nmany workplaces.  In Germany, the legislative approach to employment of\npeople with disabilities, including those with a mental health disability, is\nclosely associated with social insurance and its emphasis on rehabilitation\nrather than benefits.\nThe following situation analysis examines the scope and impact of mental\nhealth issues on the German workplace, as well as the role of all social part-\nners in addressing these issues.  Selected key agencies, organisations, and\ninstitutions were highlighted with illustrations of how important it is for all\nthe social partners to work together to be more effective.  Although, the sit-\nuation analysis is primarily concerned with the impact of mental health on\nthe workplace, and in particular with depression, it is viewed within the\ncontext of overall mental health concerns.  This is due to the nature of the\navailable information, which does not always distinguish between depres-\nsion and other mental health concerns, such as work-related stress and\nburnout. \nii\nThe situation analysis examines five major areas: Mental health at the\nnational level, the Economic burden of mental illness, Policy and the leg-\nislative framework, the Role of government and the social partners, and\nManaging mental health in the workplace.\nMENTAL HEALTH AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL examines the current socio-eco-\nnomic environment and its influence on mental health, definitions, and\nprevalence of depression and mental health services.\nTHE ECONOMIC BURDEN OF MENTAL ILLNESS discusses the economic impli-\ncations for treating mental illness.\nPOLICY AND THE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK describes the evolution of the\nlegal framework, identifies relevant laws, and discusses the support and\npromotion for rehabilitation and vocational training.\nTHE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT AND THE SOCIAL PARTNERS examines the\nimplementation of law and policy by the government, NGOs, and other\ninstitutes.\nMANAGING MENTAL HEALTH IN THE WORKPLACE discusses the importance\nof a corporate mental health promotion policy and the relationship of health\nand safety issues to workplace stress and provides examples of corporate\nworkplace health promotion and stress prevention programs.\niii\nThis page has been left blank intentionally.\nGLOSSARY\nThe definitions and terms related to mental health are evolving and still subject to muchdebate.  Terms are often used interchangeably, which can be confusing as well as inac-\ncurate.  It is therefore useful to attempt to define the vocabulary of mental health and to\nmake distinctions.  Specific countries use different terminology to refer to the same issue.\nIn the five situation analyses of mental health in the workplace, the reports have remained\nfaithful to the terminology used by the mental health community in each country.  This\nglossary therefore includes definitions of these nation- specific terms.  The following defi-\nnitions and terminology are based on current usage by such organizations as the WHO and\nILO, participating countries in the situational analyses, and the European Union.  \nThis glossary is conceptually oriented and will give the reader the familiarity with the\nvocabulary of mental health, which is necessary to fully understand the situation analyses.\nMENTAL HEALTH: Though many elements of mental health may be identifiable, the term is\nnot easy to define.  The meaning of being mentally healthy is subject to many interpreta-\ntions rooted in value judgements, which may vary across cultures.  Mental health should\nnot be seen as the absence of illness, but more to do with a form of subjective well-being,\nwhen individuals feel that they are coping, fairly in control of their lives, able to face chal-\nlenges, and take on responsibility.  Mental health is a state of successful performance of\nmental function, resulting in productive activities, fulfilling relationships with other peo-\nple, and the ability to adapt to change and to cope with adversity specific to the individual\u2019s\nculture.1\nMENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS: The vast majority of mental health problems are relatively\nmild, though distressing to the person at the time, and if recognized can be alleviated by\nsupport and perhaps some professional help.  Work and home life need not be too adverse-\nly affected if the appropriate help is obtained.2 In the situation analyses, the terms mental\nhealth problems and mental health difficulties are used interchangeably.\nMENTAL ILLNESS: Mental illness refers collectively to all diagnosable mental health prob-\nlems which become \u201cclinical,\u201d that is where a degree of professional intervention and treat-\nment is required.  Generally, the term refers to more serious problems, rather than, for\nexample, a mild episode of depression or anxiety requiring temporary help.\nThe major psychotic illnesses, such as endogenous depression, schizophrenia, and manic\ndepressive psychosis, would fall in this category and would be seen less often in the work-\nplace.3 Mental illness is sometimes referred to as psychiatric disability.4 This term is used\nprimarily in the United States.\nMENTAL DISORDERS: Mental disorders are health conditions characterized by alterations\nin thinking, mood or behaviour ( or some combination thereof) associated with distress and\n/or impaired functioning.  Mental disorders are associated with increased mortality rates.\nThe risk of death among individuals with a mental disorder is several times higher than in\nthe population as a whole.5\nDEPRESSION:  Depression is an example of a mental disorder largely marked by alterations\nin mood as well as loss of interest in activities previously enjoyed.  It affects more women\nthan men, by a ratio of about 2 to 1.  It is projected that up to 340 million people will suf-\nfer from depression in the near future.  The risk of suicide is high amongst those suffering\nfrom depression.  Yearly, over 800,000 deaths attributable to suicide are recorded world-\nwide:The majority of suicides are due to depression.6\niv\nThere is a great deal of information about the different types, causes and treatments of\ndepression.  However, it is important to realize that depression is not simple.  There are\ndifferent types and different degrees of each type.  There is a high degree of variation\namong people with depression in terms of symptoms, course of illness, and response to\ntreatment, all indicating the complexity and interacting causes of this illness.  The most\ncommon form of depression is chronic unipolar depression (clinical depression).  This cat-\negory of depression has been frequently discussed and written about in the popular media\nin recent years, primarily due to new modalities of treatment.\nOther types of depression recognized at this time are:\n\u2022 Acute Situational Depression\n\u2022 Dysthymia\n\u2022 Bipolar Depression (manic depressive disorder)\n\u2022 Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)\n\u2022 Post Partum Depression\n\u2022 Depression secondary to other diseases or drugs.\nMENTAL HEALTH PROMOTION:  Mental health promotion is a multidimensional concept\nthat implies the creation of individual, social, and environmental conditions, which enable\noptimal overall psychological development.  It is especially focussed, among other con-\ncerns, on personal autonomy, adaptability, and ability to cope with stressors, self-confi-\ndence, social skills, social responsibility, and tolerance.  Prevention of mental disorders\ncould be one of its outcomes.7\nMENTAL HEALTH PREVENTION: Prevention is based on specific knowledge about causal\nrelationships between an illness and risk factors.  Prevention results in measurable out-\ncomes.  Within the context of the workplace, prevention is concerned with taking action to\nreduce or eliminate stressors.  Prevention and promotion are overlapping and related\nactivities.  Promotion can be simultaneously preventative and vice versa.8\nPOST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER:  PTSD or post-traumatic stress disorder can occur\nas an acute disorder soon after a trauma or have a delayed onset in which symptoms occur\nmore than 6 months after the trauma.  It can occur at any age and can follow a natural\ndisaster such as flood or fire or a man-made disaster such as war, imprisonment, assault,\nor rape.\nREHABILITATION: A process aimed at enabling persons with disabilities to regain and\nmaintain their optimal physical, sensory, intellectual, psychiatric, and/ or social function-\nal levels, by providing them with tools to change their lives towards a higher level of inde-\npendence.  Rehabilitation may include measures to provide and/ or restore functions or\ncompensate for the loss or absence of a function or for a functional limitation.  The reha-\nbilitation process does not involve initial medical care.  It includes a wide range of meas-\nures and activities from more basic and general rehabilitation to goal-oriented activities,\nfor instance vocational rehabilitation.9\nSTRESS: Stress is defined as a nonspecific response of the body to any demand made upon\nit which results in symptoms such as rise in the blood pressure, release of hormones,\nquickness of breathe, tightening of muscles, perspiration, and increased cardiac activity.\nStress is not necessarily negative.  Some stress keeps us motivated and alert, while to lit-\ntle stress can create problems.  However, too much stress can trigger problems with men-\ntal and physical health, particularly over a prolonged period of time.10\nJOB STRESS: Job stress can be defined as the harmful physical and emotional response\nthat occurs when the requirements of the job do not match the capabilities, resources, or\nneeds of the worker.  Job stress can lead to poor health and even injury.  Long - term expo-\nsure to job stress has been linked to an increased risk of musculoskeletal disorders,\ndepression, and job burnout, and may contribute to a range of debilitating diseases, rang-\ning from cardiovascular disease to cancer.  Stressful working conditions also may interfere\nwith an employee\u2019s ability to work safely, contributing to work injuries and illnesses.  In\nv\nthe workplace of the 1990s, the most highly ranked and frequently reported organisation-\nal stressors are potential job loss, technological innovation, change, and ineffective top\nmanagement.  At the work unit level, work overload, poor supervision, and inadequate\ntraining are the top-ranking stressors.11\nThe following are specific examples that may lead to job stress:12\nThe design of tasks. Heavy workload, infrequent rests breaks, long work hours and\nshiftwork; hectic and routine tasks that have little inherent meaning, do not utilize work-\ners\u2019 skills and provide little sense of control.\nManagement style. Lack of participation by workers in decision-making, poor commu-\nnication in the organization, lack of family-friendly policies.\nInterpersonal relationships.  Poor social environment and lack of support or help from\ncoworkers and supervisors.\nWork roles. Conflicting to uncertain job expectations, too much responsibility, too many\n\u201chats to wear.\u201d\nCareer concerns.  Job insecurity and lack of opportunity for growth, advancement or pro-\nmotion; rapid changes for which workers are unprepared.\nEnvironmental conditions. Unpleasant or dangerous physical conditions such as\ncrowding, noise, air pollution, or ergonomic problems.\nBURNOUT:  This term is used most frequently in Finland to refer to job stressors and the\nresulting mental health problems that may occur.  It is defined as a three-dimensional syn-\ndrome, characterized by energy depletion (exhaustion), increased mental distance from\none\u2019s job (cynicism) and reduced professional efficacy.13\nMENTAL STRAIN: This term is used in the German situational analysis to refer to psycho-\nlogical stress that impacts everybody in all realms of life.\nWORK ABILITY: Individuals\u2019 work ability is based on their, physical, psychological and\nsocial capacity and professional competence, the work itself, the work environment, and\nthe work organization.  This term is often used in Finland in the world of work. \nJOB INSECURITY: Job insecurity can be defined as perceived powerlessness to maintain\ndesired continuity in a threatened job situation or as a concern about the future of one\u2019s\njob.14\nSTIGMA: Stigma can be defined as a mark of shame, disgrace, or disapproval, which results\nin an individual being shunned or rejected by others.  The stigma associated with all forms\nof mental illness is strong but generally increases the more an individual\u2019s behavior differs\nfrom that of the \u2018norm.\u201915\nINTELLECTUAL DISABILITY: This disability is defined by a person\u2019s capacity to learn and by\nwhat they can or cannot do for themselves.  People with this disability are identified by low\nscores on intelligence tests and sometimes by their poor social competence.16 The term\nmental retardation is also used to refer to a person with an intellectual disability and is\nthe most common term used in the situation analyses.\nDISABILITY MANAGEMENT: The process of effectively dealing with employees who become\ndisabled is referred to as \u201cdisability management.\u201d  Disability management means using\nservices, people, and materials to (i) minimize the impact and cost of disability to the\nemployer and the employee and (ii) encourage return to work of an employee with disabil-\nities.17 It should be noted that the term \u201cdisability management\u201d is not commonly used,\ndespite the fact that practices understood to be within the scope of disability management\nprocesses are now taking place within enterprises of all sizes worldwide.18\nvi\nThis page has been left blank intentionally.\nMental health at the national level\nPart 1\nIn Germany, since\nthe mid 1980s,\nemployees have\nexperienced an\nincrease in stress\nrelated to both physi-\ncal and mental work-\ning conditions.  This\nis due mainly to\nrationalisation and\nthe rapid introduc-\ntion of technology,\nwhich took place in\nthe industrial and\nservice sectors.\nThe socio-economic environment and mental health\nIn Germany, over the past few years the use of the term \u201cstress\u201d hasincreased significantly.  Today, stress seems to be everywhere: at work,\nin traffic, when shopping, in the family.  Feeling \u201cstressed\u201d has a negative\nconnotation and generally means being \u201coverburdened\u201d.  But stress is a\ntwo-edged sword.  It can act as a challenge, which stimulates physical and\nmental abilities, or it can lead to overload and temporary or even long-term\ndisability conditions.\nThese statements are particularly applicable to the world of work:\nResponsibility is, on the one hand, a workplace requirement which devel-\nops social and intellectual abilities.  On the other hand, under certain cir-\ncumstances, it can cause anxieties and feelings of being overloaded.  \nNegative strains can:\n\u2022 Damage mental and physical health;\n\u2022 Hinder the preservation and development of intellectual abilities\nand skills;\n\u2022 Impair social interactions (family, leisure, and political-cultural\nactivities).\nResearch has shown that mental and psychosocial strains such as monoto-\nny, time pressure, and the conduct of superiors are especially important in\nthe workplace.  Since the mid 1980s employees have experienced an\nincrease in stress related to both physical and mental working conditions.\nThis is due mainly to rationalisation and the rapid introduction of technol-\nogy, which took place in the industrial and service sectors.\nToday, entire in-company and inter-company work systems are being\nredesigned.  This includes mechanisation and automation as well as the\nuse of electronic data processing and communication technologies, which\ninvolve far-reaching changes in organisations.  New activities and work-\nplaces, a greater emphasis on group work, \u201cjust-in-time\u201d and \u201clean produc-\ntion\u201d, and a change in the division of labour due to outsourcing are having\na significant impact on stress in the workplace.  On the positive side, these\nchanges have led to a reduction in monotony, increased co-operation,\ngreater autonomy and decision-making ability through group work and\nmore highly skilled tasks.  However, stress due to time pressure, deadlines,\nand demands in terms of quality, quantity, and greater flexibility is\nincreasing.\nThese developments impact organisations in different ways.  Suppliers, for\ninstance, are particularly vulnerable to an increase in workplace stress\nbecause they have to be on continuous standby and are subject to unpre-\ndictable overtime and increased shiftwork. \nIt is becoming clear that physical stress in the workplace has decreased and\nmental stress has increased.  Social parameters at the end of the 1990s,\nincluding global market competition, unemployment, and problems in\nfinancing government social welfare benefits, have also increased work\nstress.  Many companies, however, recognise that appreciable gains in pro-\nductivity are only possible by creating a motivated and committed work-\n1\nBurnout and depres-\nsion are among the\nmost common nega-\ntive consequences\nof workplace stress.\nforce.  The level of work stress will vary according to the economic sector, the\neconomic situation, the level of rationalisation, corporate philosophy, and\nthe objectives of trade unions. \nThe increased flexibility demanded in the workforce is having a negative\neffect due to2: \n\u2022 Compression of several jobs into one,\n\u2022 Result orientation, \n\u2022 Blurring of the boundaries between work and private life, \n\u2022 Overload, \n\u2022 Unpredictability of work requirements, \n\u2022 Neglect of safety and health protection at work. \nThe prevalence of depression \nBurnout and depression are among the most common negative conse-quences of workplace stress.\nThere is an increasing amount of discussion regarding the phenomenon of\n\u201cburnout\u201d as a result of mental stress in the work environment.3 Burnout is\ncaused by a high concentration  of work and pressure to achieve, as well as\nby a strong personal identification with customers or clients and a high\nsense of responsibility.  Increasingly, in all occupations, issues related to the\norganisation of work (pressure of time, lack of social support from col-\nleagues, inadequate backing from superiors, little or no feedback and lack of\nrecognition of work performed, including social recognition) are being cited\nas possible reasons for burnout.\nAfter an initial phase of reduced commitment to work, burnout  can lead to\nemotional reactions which can impact physical and mental health.\nDepression has been cited as a mental health problem that can be triggered\nby job burnout.\nDepression has been identified in at least 6 % of the population in Germany.\nAcademic opinion continues to hold the view that women become ill twice as\noften as men.  However, studies4 indicate that women do not have depres-\nsion more frequently, but that they have a higher relapse rate and are more\nprone to chronicity.  Contrary to popular opinion, the prevalence of depres-\nsion is not necessarily related to socio-economic status.  However, as with\nother mental illnesses, if depression becomes chronic, it can lead to lower\nsocio-economic status.\nStudies state that serious depressive illness is ten times more frequent\ntoday than it was 50 ago.5 Those affected are becoming younger and\nyounger.  According to information from the Federal Ministry of Health,6\nuse of anti-depressant drugs by those aged between 25 and 30 increased\nfrom 0.1% in 1986 to 1.1% in 19897.\nFamily doctors and mental health professionals are primarily responsible\nfor the timely recognition and adequate treatment of depressive disorders.\n2\nTraditional strains Psychosocial strains\nMachine accidents -65% Inappropriate mental load +40%\nHeat, cold, draughts -37% In-company personnel turnover +43%\nAppropriate physical load -40% Time pressure, stress +65%\nNoise -47%\nThe decline of \u201ctraditional\u201d strains in the working domain \n(Raithel & Lehnert1)\nIn popular medical\nand practical guides,\ndepression is\ndescribed as the\n\u201cdisease of the age.\u201d\nHowever, family doctors diagnose only about 60% of all mental health dis-\norders.  The detection rate rises as the severity and clarity of the symptoms\nincrease.  The mental health problems which are often not recognized are\nthose which do not have fully developed symptoms of a depressive illness.\nThese mental health problems are the ones for which there are increasing-\nly treatment options which can lower the occurrence of serious depressive\nillness.\nThe focus of secondary prevention is on reducing the number and severity\nof depressive episodes and on reducing the suicide risk.  Since it can be\nassumed that over 50% of depressions are not diagnosed and over 75% are\ninadequately treated, appropriate care requires an improvement in the\nknowledge level of general practitioners.  Medication can significantly\nreduce the probability of relapse.  This can also be accomplished through\npsychotherapeutic treatment without medication though with less success.\nA combination of psychotherapy and appropriate medication appears to be\nthe most effective solution.  However, only a small percentage of persons\nwith depression in Germany receive such treatment.8\nDefining Depression\nRecent efforts have focused on defining depression as an autonomous setof pathological symptoms, rather than feelings of despondency, sadness\nor despair, which belong to the fundamental phenomenon of human experi-\nence. \nThere is a discrepancy between the \u201cacademic view\u201d, which sees depression\nin the narrow sense, as a condition triggered by a chemical imbalance, and\npopular science, which tends to propagate a wide-ranging definition of\ndepression which includes conditions due to environmental and social fac-\ntors.\nPopular science, depicts the \u201cmental torment of depression\u201d9 as caused by\nproblems which get out of control and burden a person\u2019s emotional state.\nLife as a whole becomes too much to handle, and so uncontrollable stress\nleads to exhaustion, fatigue and emptiness.  In popular medical and practi-\ncal guides, depression is described as the \u201cdisease of the age.\u201d  It is attrib-\nuted, in part, to isolation and various types of stress triggered by work, fam-\nily, and other environmental and social factors.  Pfeiler (1996)10 points out\nthat when describing the symptoms of depression, these publications only\nconsider depression due to chemical imbalance.  Nuber (1993)11 therefore\nwarns against an excessive use of the term depression.  She points out that\ndepressions have been mistakenly identified in cases of despondency, fluc-\ntuating moods, or sadness due to loss.  \u201cDepressions are an illness, whereas\nfluctuating moods and sadness are not,\u201d12 she writes.  This highlights a\nproblem which is neglected by most general practitioners and established\nneurologists13, that is the general tendency in German society to scorn act-\ning emotionally.  Even sadness is judged negatively.  When men in particu-\nlar give way to their feelings, sadness is quickly regarded as depression\nrequiring treatment.  This attitude partly explains the enormous rise in the\nincidence of depression. This situation analysis reflects a broader approach\nin understanding and defining depression rather than a narrow academic\ndefinition.\nCaring for depression\nMental health care services for people who have depression are provid-ed primarily by general practitioners or physicians and consultants in\n3\nIn general, when\nsymptoms of\ndepression arise,\nthere is easy access\nto medical help,\nwhich is free of\ncharge through the\nstatutory health\ninsurance scheme.\nneurology, psychiatry, psychotherapy, and pharmacology.  Non-medical psy-\nchotherapists are also involved in the treatment.  The mandatory health\ninsurance agencies will, under certain circumstances, cover the costs of non-\nmedical psychotherapeutic treatment.  Socio-psychiatric services, social\nservices and advisory agencies make a major contribution to care and\nadvice. In-patient care involves physicians, nurses, and psychologists, occu-\npational and rehabilitation therapists, and social workers.  In addition to\nspecialist psychiatric hospitals, there are psychiatric and psychosomatic\ndepartments in general hospitals. \nStudies estimate that about 60% of individuals who have had at least one\ndepressive episode in their lives have consulted a physician about it.\nSurveys show that in neurological practices depression was the main subject\nin about 9% of consultations.\nIn general, when symptoms arise, there is easy access to medical help, which\nis free of charge through the statutory health insurance scheme14.  Pfeiler\n(1996), however, points out that there exist major uncertainties with regard\nto adequate diagnosis, mainly on the part of non-psychiatric general practi-\ntioners.  This of course also affects the efficiency of the treatment measures.\nHe says, \u201cWith nearly half the patients diagnosed as depressive - in accor-\ndance with the classification criteria of ICD-9 - there is no depression, and\nin 87% of the cases the diagnostic classification as psychotic, neurotic and\nreactive depression is not appropriate.\u201d15 Pfeiler also points out that by far\nthe greater number (75%) of outpatients diagnosed as depressive are not\nsuffering from clinically relevant complaints. \u201cNevertheless a therapy\ninvolving psychopharmaceutical drugs is normally applied; psychosocial fac-\ntors are medicalised, which may not infrequently mean an iatrogenic chroni-\nfication of wellness disorders.\u201d16\nMental Health and Employment \nInformation regarding the employment status of the mentally disabled* is\ndifficult to obtain.  The data does not differentiate between types of disabil-\nity.  The Federal Employment Agency does not provide information about\nthe connection between type of work and type of disability.  Other sources\ndo not provide a separate category for disability caused by mental illness.\nThe Federal Statistics Agency, for instance, does not differentiate between\nparalysis caused by severance of the spinal cord, cerebral disorders, mental\nillness, and addictive illnesses.\nKleffmann (1996)17 states that approximately one third of all patients treat-\ned in psychiatric clinics are unemployed.  All available studies demonstrate\nthat individuals with mental health disabilities have a greater rate of unem-\nployment than the population at large.  Moreover a greater proportion of\npeople with mental health disabilities are unemployed in comparison with\nother types of disabilities.18\nGerman Health Reports points out that in comparison with other types of\ndisabilities people with mental health problems often require a longer peri-\nod  of recovery before they can return to work.    Particular problems arise\nfor persons with mental health disabilities when they attempt to integrate\ninto the open labour market. It is considerably more difficult to re-integrate\n4\n*In Germany, the term \u201cmentally disabled\u201d (\u201cgeisteg Behinderte\u201d) is used in a legal as\nwell as a popular context to refer to persons with mental health disabilities and per-\nsons with intellectual disabilities/mental retardation. (4th Report of the Federal\nGovernment of Germany on the Situation of Persons with Disabilities and the\nDevelopment of Rehabilitation. Editor Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs,\n1998) Since this report does not address persons with intellectual disabilities, the term\n\u201cmentally disabled\u201d will not be used but rather the phrase \u201cmental health disabilities.\u201d \nIn Germany, there is\na growing unem-\nployment rate\namong people with\ndisabilities.\nthe severely disabled into working life than those who are not disabled.  In\nall age groups the severely disabled remain unemployed for longer periods\nand do not have as many job opportunities as their peers who are not dis-\nabled. \nBecause available statistics do not differentiate between types of disability,\nthis report refers to all of the severely disabled. \nIn Germany, the situation of the severely disabled in the labour market con-\ntinues to worsen.  The number of severely disabled people of working age is\nincreasing and employment opportunities are limited.  Consequently, there\nis a growing unemployment rate among people with disabilities.  The gap\nbetween supply and demand of jobs for disabled persons is growing19.  The\nactual number of disabled workers employed by employers in the private\nand public sectors who are obliged by law to employ disabled workers has\ndecreased from 4.2% (1993) through 4.0% (1994 and 1995) down to 3,9%\n(1996).  The rate of unemployment among the severely disabled has risen\nfrom 14.6% (1993), 15.0% (1994), 15.4% (1995), 16.1% (1996) up to 17.9%\n(1997).\nHealth and unemployment are related to one another in many ways.  Partly\ndue to company policy regarding hiring and dismissal of staff, people who\nare not perfectly healthy or whose working capacity is limited are more like-\nly to be unemployed.  They run a greater risk of being dismissed, remain\nunemployed for a longer than average period, and their chances of re-inte-\ngration into working life are lower.\nJob loss and long-term unemployment can lead to behaviour which damages\nhealth and can cause or exacerbate mental health problems resulting from\nthe sufferer\u2019s relationship to society.  The proportion of the unemployed suf-\nfering from health problems varied in West Germany between 19% (1985)\nand 28,7% (1992). In 1997 the figure was 25,3% of the total unemployed.  In\nEast Germany, the figure has risen from 10.0% in 1992 to 16.4% in 1997.\nWithin these statistics, the blue-collar sector and the older and long-term\nunemployed predominate.  They are the ones who find it most difficult to\nreintegrate into the labour market. \nFinancial disadvantage, and the need to drastically limit expenses or to\nenter into debt because of unemployment are important causes of psychoso-\ncial stress.  In the 1930s, inadequate nutrition and poor living conditions\nhad a serious impact on health.   Today, in contrast, improved social secu-\nrity provisions prevent the unemployed from experiencing the full effects of\npoverty. Nevertheless, unemployment does carry the risk of poverty in\nGermany.  If the economic situation of the unemployed continues to deteri-\norate, the situation which existed in the 1930s could gain new relevance. \nThe negative effects of unemployment vary according to age and work expe-\nrience.  Those who are unemployed in middle age (generally with depen-\ndants) are most vulnerable.  Older people are less vulnerable because they\ntake early retirement out of a sense of inevitability and resignation.  The\nyoung who have never worked are also less vulnerable.  However, if they are\nnot given the chance to work, they miss out on opportunities for self-devel-\nopment, such as the transition from school to working life, which are usual-\nly beneficial to mental health. \nIn a society centred around work, employment represents the most impor-\ntant connection with social reality.  In addition to providing an independent\nliving, earning money fulfils many other decisive psychological functions\nsuch as:\n\u2022 Provision of social contacts outside the immediate social circle \n\u2022 Pursuit of common goals \n\u2022 Acquisition or use of skills \n\u2022 Fixed time structure\n5\nAccording to\nGerman Health\nReports:\n\u201cJobs which have a\nnegative effect on\nhealth increase the\nrisk of damage to\nhealth in the long\nterm and therefore\nalso the risk of los-\ning the job itself.\nUnemployed per-\nsons who already\nhave problems with\nhealth are particular-\nly vulnerable to the\nstress of unemploy-\nment, as this\nemphasises the\neffects of other\nstressful life condi-\ntions . It is consider-\nably more difficult\nfor unemployed per-\nsons with health\nproblems to return\nto employment; the\nperiod for which\nthey are unem-\nployed is longer on\naverage.  In addi-\ntion, the longer the\nperiod of unemploy-\nment, the more diffi-\nculty the long term\nunemployed have in\nfinding a job.\u201d20\n\u2022 social status and professional prestige.\nThese psychological functions often can not be fulfilled by other activities. \nPeople may react to unemployment in different ways. Some individuals, for\nexample,  have chosen to be unemployed during a transition from one job to\nanother and consequently do not experience as much distress. Others have\na dramatic emotional reaction as a result of the accumulation of everyday\nstresses and because the effects of unemployment are often stronger when\nother personal crises occur.  The German health report for 1998 cites the fol-\nlowing factors with regard to the handling of unemployment by the individ-\nual: \n\u201cThe significance of the way work has been experienced up to the time of\nunemployment is a central factor. As is to be expected, an individual who\nplaces a high value on working suffers more from the loss of employment. \nReactions of men and women to unemployment differ particularly when\nwork has a different meaning for each of them.  If alternative social roles to\nwork are available, this can lessen the results of job loss on an individual\nbasis.  For women, alternatives are more readily available in the tradition-\nal social roles of housewife and mother, which encourages some women to\nenter the \u201csilent reserve\u201d of the labour market.  Results of studies from the\nformer East Germany show, however, that the fact that a large proportion\nof women previously worked and that they were strongly orientated towards\ntheir work is responsible for comparable stress levels in women and men in\nthis region.\u201d\n6\nThe economic burden of\nmental illness\nPart 2\nBackground information and data \nIn 1993, 2.2% of days lost from work among compulsory members of thestatutory health insurance scheme were due to depressive disorders (a\ntotal of about 282,000 cases of work incapacity leading to 10.9 million days\nabsence).  Women accounted for about twice as many cases of work inca-\npacity as men (1,285 versus 592 cases per 100,000 compulsory members).\nAccording to statistics from local insurance funds (Allgemeine\nOrtskrankenkassen \u2013 AOK) AOK West accounted for more than twice as\nmany cases of work incapacity as AOK East (AOK West: men 748, women\n1,670; AOK East: men 314, women 782 cases of work incapacity per 100,\n000 compulsory members).*\nOn average, depression-related work incapacity lasts approximately two\nand a half times longer than incapacity due to other illnesses.  Depressive\ndisorders account for a significant proportion of premature retirements.  In\n1995 there were 18,629 early retirements (7,146 men, 11,483 women) due\nto depressive disorders, corresponding to approximately 6.3% of all 297,164\nearly retirements.  The average retirement age was between 50 and 54.\nIn 1998 the annual average sickness rate for employed compulsory compa-\nny health fund members was only 4.4 %, the lowest in 30 years, including\nthe old Federal States (4.5%). 1 In 1997, around 81% of absences due to\nwork incapacity could be attributed to six groups of illnesses: muscular and\nskeletal disorders (29.2%), disorders of the respiratory tracts (16.8%),\ninjuries/poisoning (14.1%), digestive disorders (7.7%), heart and circulation\ndisorders (7.3%) and psychiatric disorders (5.8%).  Though there is a down-\nward trend in sick leaves due to the other five illness groups, the figures\nare up for mental health problems.  This is partly due to changes in diag-\nnostic procedures.  Though mental health disorders as an illness group\nremained of secondary importance in the old Federal States through the\n1980s, they currently account for 5.9% of all days of illness and occupy sixth\nplace in terms of work incapacity.  They are the third most important diag-\nnostic group in hospitals, representing 11% of treatment days. \nSuicide and illnesses allied to depression\nPeople with depression are at greater risk of committing suicide.  It isestimated in Germany that 3-4%  of people with depression commit sui-\ncide.  In the case of people who are receiving or have received in-patient\ntreatment for major depression, the probability is 15%. In fact, a large pro-\nportion of all suicides are attributed to depression.2\nAlthough different mental illnesses can coexist in the same person, this sit-\nuation  is  often underestimated.  More than 60% of all patients are diag-\nnosed with more than one  mental illness.   In the case of major depression\nit can be assumed that a personality disorder is present in approximately\n18% of cases and addictive illness and anxiety are present in 60-75%.  It is\n7\nThough days lost\nfrom work due to\nother major illness\ngroups are declining,\nan increasing num-\nber of sick leaves\ncan be attributed to\nmental health prob-\nlems.\n*AOK West covers insured people in the former West Germany while AOK East\ncovers those in the former East Germany.  The socio-economic conditions in the two\nparts still differ significantly in several aspects even ten years after reunification.\nAccording to an\nestimate by the\nFederal Institute for\nOccupational Safety\nand Health, in 1997,\nmental health disor-\nders accounted for\ncosts of 5.2 billion DM\nin production lost\nbecause of absen-\nteeism. \noften overlooked that in 10% of cases, patients with psychosomatic or chron-\nic somatic illnesses also suffer from depression.  Depressive disorder is pres-\nent in approximately 15% of non-surgical and surgical hospital cases.  This\nfigure rises to 30-35% in the case of patients suffering from neurological dis-\norders.3\nThe cost of treating mental illness\nIn 1995, approximately 1% of all registered hospital cases were attributedto depressive disorders.  The cost of this in-patient treatment is estimat-\ned at 2 billion DM per year.  Individuals with depression represented 3.3%\nof the 900,973 rehabilitation treatments paid for by pension insurance.4\nIncapacity to work leads to absenteeism and ensuing loss of resources.  In\n1994, 2.32 million working years were lost through absenteeism.  Men\naccounted for 1.28 million or 55.3% of absences caused by illness and women\n1.03 million or 44.7%.  It is difficult; however, to determine the number of\nworking years lost through depression because the statistics are not differ-\nentiated.  \nIn Germany, there is no adequate database for determining exact sickness\ncosts, but some studies provide indications.  Both direct and indirect costs of\nmedical treatment, such as production losses due to absenteeism, should be\nincluded in calculations.  For 1997, based on statistics for employed persons\n(excluding self-employed) and the gross income from employment, the\nFederal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health determined an annu-\nal volume of 89.5 billion DM in production lost because of absenteeism relat-\ned to illness.  According to this estimate, mental health disorders account for\ncosts of 5.2 billion DM. \n8\nPolicy and the legislative\nframework\nPart 3\nThe German system of social security has a long history.  It emphasisessocial insurance, which protects against illness, accidents at work,\nunemployment, disability, old age, and death. The system is funded prima-\nrily through contributions from employees and employers; benefits are\neither in the form of cash payments or services.\nThe main features of the German social insurance system are:\n\u2022 Compulsory insurance: everyone is required to protect him or her-\nself against risk.\n\u2022 Solidarity: through their work and contributions the working pop-\nulation enables those who can no longer work to benefit from economic\ndevelopment.\n\u2022 Autonomous administration: volunteer representatives of the\ninsured and of employers co-operate in the management of social insur-\nance. \nThere are five types of insurance within the system: health, accident, pen-\nsions, unemployment, and nursing.  Each branch operates independently,\nbut their decision-making process is bound by statutory regulations.\nHealth insurance and accident insurance play an important role in work-\nplace health promotion and protection.  \nThe services offered by health insurance funds are governed by the Fifth\nBook of the Social Security Code.  They mainly provide benefits in kind,\nmeaning that insured persons receive health care services from suppliers\nwho are paid directly by the health insurance funds.  Health insurance is\ncovered by the following funds:\n\u2022 Local sickness funds \n\u2022 Guilds\u2019 insurance funds \n\u2022 Companies\u2019 health insurance funds \n\u2022 Substitute insurance funds \n\u2022 Agricultural insurance funds \n\u2022 Seamen\u2019s health insurance fund\n\u2022 Federal miners\u2019 insurance fund\nThe statutory accident insurance funds insure their members against acci-\ndents in the workplace, including occupational diseases.  Their primary\nresponsibility is to prevent accidents at work, occupational diseases, and\nwork-related health risks.  The benefits they provide are: medical and voca-\ntional rehabilitation, injury benefits or temporary allowances, nursing, dis-\nability pensions or survivors\u2019 pensions, and transportation costs and death\nbenefits.\nIn Germany, professional and trade associations are the accident insurance\ncarriers.  They include industrial associations (for all enterprises in indus-\ntry and the public service sector, agricultural and horticultural enterpris-\nes) and the mariners\u2018 association (for all of seafaring and sea-fishery enter-\nprises).\nIn 1989, under the Act on the Structural Reform of the Health Care\nSystem, health promotion became a legal component of health insurance\npolicies.  This enabled health insurance funds to develop and finance a\n9\nThe German system\nof social security has\na long history.  It\nemphasises social\ninsurance, which\nprotects against ill-\nness, accidents at\nwork, unemployment,\ndisability, old age,\nand death.\nGermany\u2019s new\nhealth care reform\ninitiative requires\nthe health insurance\nfunds to engage in\npreventing work-\nrelated health risk.\nHealth promotion\ninterventions in the\nworkplace are\ndefined as any activ-\nity which con-\ntributes to prevent-\ning workplace haz-\nards by strengthen-\ning factors con-\nducive to health at\nindividual and\norganisational lev-\nels.\nbroad range of workplace health promotion programmes and activities.  The\nbig branches of health insurance funds therefore allocated a small part of\ntheir research resources to health promotion. \nIn 1997, the health insurance funds were re-regulated.  They could no longer\nfund community health promotion activities, and their workplace-related\nactivities were restricted to research into possible relationships between\nhazardous working conditions and work-related diseases.  At the same time,\nthe responsibilities of the statutory accident insurance funds in the area of\nprevention were expanded.  These changes resulted from adapting German\nstatutes to the European Framework Directive on Health and Safety\n(Worker Protection Act 1996), which extended the obligations and responsi-\nbilities of employers with regard to health and safety.  They strengthened\nco-operation between health and accident insurance funds. \nFollowing the inauguration of the new German administration in 1998, the\nGerman Health Ministry started a new health care reform initiative aimed\nat containing escalating public health care costs.  As part of this initiative\nthe Federal government again revised the legal basis for health promotion\ninvestments by health insurance funds.  Beginning on January 1, 2000 the\nhealth insurance funds were again authorised to develop and finance work-\nplace health promotion, including the organisation of primary prevention\nand workplace health promotion activities.  All activities have to be based\non a national quality assurance system established by the health insurance\nfunds and must bring in other key players in public health such as the fed-\neral health agency, public health services, public health sciences, and the\nmedical profession.\nThe new law defines workplace health promotion as a supplementary field\nof action to health and safety.  It requires the health insurance funds to\nengage in preventing work-related health risks.  Total expenditures of the\nhealth insurance funds may not exceed 5 Deutschmarks per insured per\nyear for health promotion.\nBased on the Worker Protection Act and the extended prevention role of the\naccident insurance funds, the new strategy to ensure health and safety at\nwork comprises the following elements:\n\u2022 Hazard and stress analysis (risk assessment)\n\u2022 Planning of interventions\n\u2022 Prevention of accidents at work and work-related diseases\n\u2022 Health and safety at work\nHealth promotion interventions in the workplace are defined as any activi-\nty which contributes to preventing workplace hazards by strengthening fac-\ntors conducive to health at individual and organisational levels.  The\nGerman approach reflects the concept of workplace health promotion laid\ndown in the Luxembourg Declaration of the European Network for\nWorkplace Health Promotion, which has been formally adopted by a num-\nber of German companies. \nDiscrimination and the right to work: the evolution\nof the legal framework\nAccording to German law, \u201cdisabled people\u201d are all those who are affect-ed by a functional limitation originating from a physical, mental, or\nemotional state, which deviates from the norm for a person of that age and\nis not temporary.  This reflects the three stages of the WHO definition of\ndisablement: impairment, disability, handicap.\nThe right of all people to be treated equally is firmly rooted in the German\nBasic Law, to which the following statement was added in 1994: \u201cNo-one\n10\nIn all German laws\nand regulations,\nmental health dis-\nability is placed on\nthe same level as\nphysical disability.\nIt is not governed by\nseparate laws or\ntreated in a special\nway.  \nThe co-ordination of\nservices and achiev-\ning uninterrupted\nprocedures are seen\nin Germany to be the\ncentral problems in\ntrying to achieve\neffective and cost-\neffective rehabilita-\ntion.\u201d1\nIn the private and\npublic sectors, com-\npanies with more\nthan 16 employees\nmust fill 6% of jobs\nwith disabled per-\nsons in a way which\nallows them to be\n\u201cable to utilise and\ndevelop further their\nknowledge and skills\nas fully as possible.\u201d\nmay be disadvantaged because of his disability.\u201d  According to the First\nBook of the Code of Social Law, people who are physically, mentally, or\nemotionally disabled or who are threatened by this type disability have a\n\u201csocial right\u201d to the help they require.  The goals of the law, and of the Act\non the Harmonisation of the Services for Rehabilitation and the\nFederal Social Assistance Act, are as follows: \n\u2022 To prevent, remove, or improve disability, avoid its worsening, or\nreduce its effects; \n\u2022 To secure a place in the community, particularly in working life, for\nthe disabled person, which corresponds to his or her preferences and abili-\nties. \nAs in all other German laws and regulations, mental health disability is\nplaced on the same level as physical disability.  It is not governed by sepa-\nrate laws or treated in a special way.  Legislation also exists to promote the\ninclusion of people with mental health disabilities in gainful employment.\nThe most important laws governing the rights of people with disabilities\nare:\n\u2022 The Social Code,\n\u2022 The Vocational Training Act,\n\u2022 The Employment Protection Act,\n\u2022 The Severely Disabled Persons Act 1974.\nThe objective of all of these laws is to rehabilitate people with disabilities\nand allow them, as far as possible, to permanently engage in gainful work.\nTheir underlying principle, \u201crehabilitation before pension,\u201d is laid down in\nthe Rehabilitation Harmonisation Act.  Rehabilitation is based on a net-\nwork of medical, educational, occupational, and social measures.\nResponsibility for rehabilitation is shared by:\n\u2022 Statutory health insurance,\n\u2022 Statutory pensions insurance,\n\u2022 Statutory accident insurance,\n\u2022 Social welfare agencies, State benefit offices, local benefit offices,\nthe main welfare offices and local welfare offices, \n\u2022 The Federal Institute for Labour,\n\u2022 Communities, if none of the former are responsible.\nThe nature and cause of the disability and the insurance relationship deter-\nmine which of these institutions is responsible.  Despite basic entitlement\nto equal benefits, the number of rehabilitation initiatives and of institutions\ncharged with enforcing them is so large, that individuals with the same dis-\nability sometimes receive different benefits.  Though the involvement of so\nmany agencies and institutions allows specific preventive activities and the\ndevelopment of defined policies and services, the co-ordination of services\nneeds to be improved to avoid inconsistency, difficulties in identifying the\nappropriate agency, and delays in the delivery of services.  Some regions\nand local authorities have appointed a disabled services co-ordinator, but in\nmost cases this is left to independent institutions (NGOs). \nTHE SEVERELY DISABLED PERSONS ACT 1974\nThe Severely Disabled Persons Act covers the relationship between employ-\ners and severely disabled employees.  The Act\u2019s  primary function is to pro-\ntect workers with disabilities and define employers\u2019 responsibilities towards\nthem.  Amended in 1986 and 1990, it is the basis of current compulsory\nemployment policy.  In the private and public sectors, companies with more\nthan 16 employees must fill 6% of jobs with disabled persons in a way which\nallows them to be \u201cable to utilise and develop further their knowledge and\n11\n\u201cThere is the danger\nthat the disadvan-\ntages resulting from\nformal equality of\ntreatment will give a\nboost to further\nexclusion of mental-\nly disabled persons.\nThe legal equality\nprovided by the\nSeverely Disabled\nPersons Act does\nnot always lead to\nequal opportunities.\nFor example, the\nspecial employment\nprotection often\ndoes not become a\nreality for the men-\ntally disabled.  It can\nonly be granted if at\nleast an application\nfor recognition of\nthe disability has\nbeen submitted at\nthe time the notice\nof dismissal is\ngiven... In the case\nof mentally disabled\npersons (this) ... is\noften not the case.\nThey waive the right\nto a disability identi-\nty card for fear of\nbeing stigmatised.\u201d4\nskills as fully as possible\u201d2.  The act does, however, allow the employer to\nsubstitute a fee and \u201cbuy out\u201d of this obligation.  In the past, employers have\nattempted to avoid taking on new staff with disabilities by satisfying the\nquota through long-standing employees diagnosed as disabled*.\nUnder the Severely Disabled Persons Act the disabled employees are enti-\ntled to special employment protection.  A person with a disability can only\nbe given notice of dismissal with the consent of the main welfare body.  This,\nhowever, discourages employers from hiring individuals with disabilities\nbecause it gives them the false impression that disabled persons have\nabsolute job security. \nThe act establishes finance grants, which are administered by the main wel-\nfare agencies in collaboration with psychosocial services and independent\nagencies.  These grants are intended to ensure that disabled persons are\nemployed in accordance with their skills and knowledge and that they do not\nlose their social status.  The grants are not linked to the severity of the dis-\nability.  People with mental health disabilities usually do not want to be\nissued \u201ca disability identity card,\u201d which indicates that they are 30% to 50%\ndisabled and unable to find or retain employment for fear of stigmatisation.\nGerman legislation does not differentiate between physically, mentally, or\npsychologically disabled people, which can lead to unequal treatment for the\nmentally and psychologically disabled.  Because much of medical, occupa-\ntional, and social rehabilitation is geared to physical disabilities, it can be\ncounterproductive for the mentally disabled, whose treatment requires a\nhighly integrated team approach.3 Rehabilitation facilities are usually\nlocated a long way from people\u2019s homes, which, in the case of the mentally\ndisabled, often worsens the feeling of social isolation. \nVocational training for people with disabilities\nIn Germany, the Federal Institute for Vocational Training recognisesabout 780 training regulations for disabled persons, relating to approxi-\nmately 150 occupations.  People with disabilities can apply to the agency\nresponsible for specific training for training according to special regulations.  \nThe Vocational Training Act and the Crafts Regulations provide for the\nmodification of training courses set out in the Training Regulations to take\ninto account the needs of disabled trainees.  To increase equality of oppor-\ntunity, the Federal Institute for Vocational Training adopted a recommen-\ndation in 1998 for the development of nation-wide special training regula-\ntions for disabled persons.  The chambers of industry, commerce, and crafts\nhave also passed regional training regulations.  The mentally disabled, like\nthe physically disabled, receive the help and services required for their per-\nmanent integration into the workplace.  However, professional rehabilita-\ntion is not implemented as automatically for the mentally disabled as for the\nphysically disabled.  Characteristics of mental health disability make tar-\ngeted rehabilitation more difficult.  \u201cIt is often not possible to make a safe\nprediction with regard to the success of the measures; if this is the case it is\nnecessary first to develop prospects for rehabilitation within the framework\nof specific preparation for work which helps to chart a course from clinical\nsupervision into the real world of work and social life.\u201d5\n12\n*In Germany, all people who are legally recognized as being disabled are labelled\n\u201cschwerbehindert\u201d which translates literally as being \u201cseverely disabled\u201d: Within the\nlaw, there exist different levels regarding the degree of disability.  As the term\n\u201cseverely disabled\u201d creates misunderstandings in international discussion, this\nreport refers to disabled persons meaning all persons having a legally recognized\ndisability and being covered by the Severely Disabled Persons Act.\nPrevention is inte-\ngral to any rehabili-\ntative approach.\nThe substance of\nprevention must be\naimed at mitigating\nrisk factors which\nworsen illness and\nthe ensuing disabili-\nty. \nVocational training\nof people with men-\ntal health disabilities\nis based on the con-\ncept of keeping peo-\nple \u201cas close to the\ncommunity and the\ncompany as possi-\nble\u201d.\nTraining courses which aim to prepare the mentally disabled for work take\nplace in job training centres and in rehabilitation institutions for the men-\ntally ill and disabled.  They provide important opportunities for job prepa-\nration near the participant\u2019s home.  While rehabilitation institutions carry\nout medical treatment and initial preparation for working life, the job train-\ning centres, as special institutions for professional rehabilitation, offer prac-\ntical occupational qualifications as well as psychosocial support.  They\nimpart or update professional knowledge and skills and give participants\nthe opportunity to practice or acquire generally expected modes of social\nbehaviour in the workplace or at the training or retraining location.  They\ndo this by:\n\u2022 Strengthening physical, mental and social stability, \n\u2022 Encouraging motivation, \n\u2022 Creating the necessary view of reality, \n\u2022 Preparing for and implementing a realistic choice of job or profes-\nsion, \n\u2022 Getting to know and dealing with the disability in the real world of\nwork. \n\u201cThe courses offered in the job training centres generally last between 12\nand 15 months, but three-month courses are also offered. The aim is to find\na realistic job perspective, to reintegrate the participants into the general\nemployment market or to make them sufficiently stable to undertake sub-\nsequent retraining or training.  In some cases the course may lead to the\njudgement that an individual is not fit for work.\u201d6 Men and women who are\ngenerally at least 18 years old and who have a mental health problem can\nbe accepted into job training centres.\nREHABILITATION\nKey components of rehabilitation for mental health disabilities (as with all\ndisabilities) are vocational assessment, training, and follow-up support.\nThis process  must be handled flexibly and without rigid time limits.  It\nshould always be possible to extend or shorten the measures and to switch\nbetween medical and occupational rehabilitation.\n\u201cTo avoid relapses, waiting times must be minimised and utilised as mean-\ningfully as possible.  For mentally disabled persons frequent changes of\nmeasures with different reference persons and geographical situations must\nbe avoided. Training measures to prepare for an occupation should pass as\nsmoothly as possibly into vocational training.\u201c7\nVocational training of people with mental health disabilities is based on the\nconcept of keeping people \u201cas close to the community and the company as\npossible\u201d.  But studies show \u201cthat 40% of adolescents suffering from schizo-\nphrenia cannot immediately resume their educational and occupational\nactivity or return to their home environment after inpatient treatment\nbecause of the chronic nature of their disorder or marked disturbances with-\nin their family.\u201d8 Training is also based on the principle that one should\nproceed to a higher level of occupational qualification only after the lower\nlevel has been consolidated.  \u201cThe premature commencement of occupation-\nal rehabilitation measures based on unreal wishes without understanding\nof the illness mostly results in failure.\u201d9 The purpose of rehabilitation is not\nonly to integrate people with disabilities into the economic and social main-\nstream of society, but also to prevent further disability.  Prevention is inte-\ngral to any rehabilitative approach.  The substance of prevention must be\naimed at mitigating risk factors which worsen illness and the ensuing dis-\nability. \nThe choice of occupation for the individual with a mental health disability\nis determined by the specific dynamics of the illness.  Preparation for occu-\n13\nIn Germany, finan-\ncial support for\ncompanies integrat-\ning disabled\nemployees into the\nworkplace is avail-\nable from the\nEmployment Office.\nBenefits are also\navailable under the\nSeverely Disabled\nPersons Act. \n\u201cPsychosocial serv-\nices and work assist-\nantships help pre-\npare and stabilise\nintegration.  The\ntasks encompass\neducational work for\ncompanies, intensive\nadvice, support, and\nassistance with prob-\nlems in the company\nand the social envi-\nronment.\u201d13\npational and social re-integration should take place in the hospital and\nshould. begin as soon as the acute illness processes have receded.\nCollaboration between the general practitioner, the consultant, the hospital,\nthe vocational adviser, the school, the parents and the rehabilitation facili-\nty is essential\n\u201cMeasures to prepare for an occupation therefore fulfill an important bridg-\ning function towards occupational and social reality.  On this road the dis-\nabled person often needs special assistance to master the anxieties arising\n(medication, sound relationships, dosed demands, experience of success,\nrecuperation breaks, possibilities of withdrawing).\u201d10\nWORK AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY\nLengthy periods of illness or hospital stays frequently lead to a loss of ele-\nmentary mental and social skills.  \u201cPatterns of communication and interac-\ntion acquired in the illness process and typical for mentally disabled persons\nhave to be broken down and new patterns of communication learned.  It\nshould also be considered, however, that for some patients the hospital with\nits very low-stimulus and low-demand living organisation is an attractive\nalternative to the anxiety-inducing demands of actual life.\u201d11\nThe crucial consideration in occupational integration is to make vocational\ntraining available as soon as the appropriate training programme has been\nidentified.\n\u201cThe working time must be organised to be as flexible as possible (breaks,\npossibilities for withdrawing when overtaxed, work plans before and after\ncrises).  By means of adapted requirements overload and understretching\nmust be avoided as far as possible.\u201d12\nFinancial support for companies integrating disabled employees into the\nworkplace is available from the Employment Office.  Benefits are also avail-\nable under the Severely Disabled Persons Act. \nCORPORATE OCCUPATIONAL TRAINING\nA stable home and flexible training programme are the major prerequisites\nfor the success of corporate occupational training for mentally disabled per-\nsons.  Companies can access the support of skilled specialists, usually pro-\nvided through local psychosocial services.  Special provisions can be made\nfor people with mental health disabilities for whom the standard examina-\ntion situations are too emotionally stressful to allow peak performance.  And\nthere are special training regulations for disabled persons. \nWorkshops for disabled people cater primarily to people with intellectu-\nal disabilities  who are not ready for the general employment market.   Since\nthe workshops are geared primarily to people with intellectual and physi-\ncally disabilities,  individuals with mental health disabilities often are not\nperforming tasks which match their capabilities.  Furthermore, they often\nfeel stigmatized by being juxtapositioned with more visible disabilities\nTransitional companies ease the transition from a workshop for disabled\npeople to the general employment market.  They often include companies\noperating as much as possible under  market conditions.   They seek to mit-\nigate the processes of mental and social deterioration brought about by\nunemployment and long periods of hospitalisation and preparation for rein-\ntegration.  A major element of these models is that they provide reasonable\nremuneration appropriate to the work performed. \nSpecial forms of assistance are necessary to enable persons with mental\nhealth disabilities to enter the world of gainful employment.  Socio-psychi-\natric services, which have been built up over the past few years, seek to\ninvolve patient organisations and family to prevent social withdrawal and to\nrestore or maintain qualifications. \n14\nSelf-help initiatives: The advent of social psychiatry has led to the emer-\ngence of numerous self-help organisations and introduced psychotherapeu-\ntic approaches into rehabilitation.  To be effective, however, they require a\nsupportive situation in the community, workplace, and family, which is not\nalways present. \n15\nThis page has been left blank intentionally.\nThe role of government and\nthe social partners\nPart 4\nGovernment\nGovernment policy in Germany is to treat all types of disability equally.It attempts to create as much equality of opportunity as possible for\ndisabled people and to reduce disadvantages.  It assumes that disabled per-\nsons are not  passive recipients or objects of help and support.  In fact they\nare responsible citizens and are the experts regarding their disability and\nhow they can best use their abilities to ensure their social and economic\nintegration into society.\nLegal regulations, institutions, and services cannot be more than an oppor-\ntunity and a chance for integration.  The disabled person or the person\nthreatened with disability must be motivated to take advantage of them.\nAdvice and help regarding integration must be adapted to the  person\u2019s\nlevel of motivation and must develop it, taking into consideration the reha-\nbilitation measures which are possible in each case. \nTHE INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORK\nQuestions regarding the rehabilitation and integration of disabled people\nmust be discussed and solved nationally, but they are also the subject of a\ngrowing exchange of experience at the international level.  Achieving equal\nopportunity for people with disabilities is becoming a central feature of\ndecisions taken internationally.  Ethical questions regarding treatment,\nparticularly of people who are unable to grant permission on their own\nbehalf, are being more frequently discussed.  \nResolutions and directives of the European Council of Ministers and the\nUnited Nations have influenced German policy and legislation. The\nEuropean Council of Ministers has played a pioneering role with its 1992\nresolution regarding \u201cA coherent policy for the disabled.\u201d  This sets out a\ncomprehensive concept and direction, relating the demands and develop-\nments in the different areas of life and politics to one another and drafting\na script for a European policy for disabled persons.  The \u201cFramework\nProvisions for the Creation of Equality of Opportunity for the Disabled \u201d\nwhich were passed by the General Assembly of the United Nations are also\nattracting increasing public attention. \nThe specifications of the European Council of Ministers and the United\nNations influenced the  resolutions passed by the executive institutions of\nthe European Union.  The European Parliament refers to the framework\ndirectives of the United Nations in its 1996 \u201cResolution on the Rights of the\nDisabled.\u201d  The Council of Ministers and the government representatives in\nthe Council refer to the resolution of the European Council of Ministers in\ntheir \u201cResolution on Equality of Opportunity for the Disabled,\u201d also of 1996.\nBoth resolutions require that member states achieve equality of opportuni-\nty for disabled people and state strongly that any kind of negative discrim-\nination against people with disabilities must be avoided or eliminated. \nIn order to further strengthen these goals, the European Council of\nMinisters included the following in the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997:\n\u2022 An employment chapter which also applies to the disabled; \n16\nGerman government\npolicy assumes that\ndisabled persons are\nnot  passive recipi-\nents or objects of\nhelp and support.  In\nfact they are respon-\nsible citizens and are\nthe experts regarding\ntheir disability and\nhow they can best\nuse their abilities to\nensure their social\nand economic inte-\ngration into society.\nGerman policy on\ndisability issues is\nbeing influenced by\nthe European\nCouncil of Ministers\nand the United\nNations.\n\u201cNo-one may be put\nat a disadvantage\nbecause of his or\nher disability.\u201d\nGerman Basic Law,\n1994\nThe Federation of\nGerman Employer\nAssociations advo-\ncates maximising\nthe efficiency of\nrehabilitation meas-\nures and increasing\nthe responsibility of\ndisabled persons for\ntheir own concerns\nand care.  \n\u2022 The social charter, which did not previously apply to all member\nstates; \n\u2022 Empowerments in the Treaty on the European Union for\nCommunity institutions; \n\u2022 Fighting discrimination on several grounds including disability; \n\u2022 With a qualified majority, programmes to establish initiatives to\ncombat social exclusion. \nPositive discrimination, such as the obligation to employ disabled persons\nand the special employment security, which they enjoy, cannot be called into\nquestion at the European level.  The Treaty of Amsterdam led to a strength-\nening of social policy at the level of the European Community.\nPOLICY IN GERMANY\nA 1994 change to the German Basic Law stating that \u201cno-one may be put at\na disadvantage because of his or her disability\u201c had the following effects:\n\u2022 Efforts towards equal rights for disabled people and their participa-\ntion in the life of society were confirmed and took an important step forward;\n\u2022 The presumption that disabled people should be integrated into\nsociety became a stronger component of the Constitution of the Federal\nRepublic of Germany; \n\u2022 The protection of disabled persons against disadvantageous treat-\nment acquired constitutional status. \nAs a fundamental constitutional right, prohibition of disadvantageous\ntreatment is binding on the legislature, the administration, the judiciary,\nand the rulings of the courts in the Federation and the Federal States.  The\nBasic Law gives disabled persons the right to demand that unfavourable\ndecisions and measures taken by public authorities not be based on any\nphysical, mental, or emotional disability.  This is a right which protects indi-\nviduals, but does not extend to groups. \nThough the Basic Law does not contain specific directives to legislative\nauthorities, the German government considers it fundamentally appropri-\nate to change rulings which are considered by many disabled persons to be\ndiscriminatory or disadvantageous, as a supplement to the constitutional\nlaw. - In this connection, the relevant associations cite the following as dis-\ncriminatory:\n\u2022 \u00a7 8 Par. 1 of the German Civil Code, which states that legally incom-\npetent persons are not permitted to establish a permanent residence, \n\u2022 \u00a7\u00a7 104 and 105 of the German Civil Code regarding legal incompe-\ntence, \n\u2022 The obligation of disabled persons to present a psychological report\nbefore being granted a driving licence, \n\u2022 Fire-related regulations which specify that disabled persons may\nnot enter certain premises or may only enter them under certain conditions.\nThe legislature recognises the necessity for improved co-ordination between\nexisting agencies and instruments and improved co-operation between the\ninstitutions responsible for rehabilitation. \nThe Social Partners\nThe social partners agree on the principle of integrating people with dis-abilities into the economic and social mainstream of society.  To protect\nthe interests of taxpayers and of other stakeholders who contribute to the\ncosts of rehabilitation, the Federation of German Employer Associations\nadvocates maximising the efficiency of rehabilitation measures and increas-\n17\n\u201cIt is necessary in\nparticular to obtain a\nuniform definition of\ndisability, one which\nmakes clear the rela-\ntionship between\nphysical damage\nand its conse-\nquences for work\nand occupation, as\nwell as an improved\nco-operation and\nnetworking between\noccupational reha-\nbilitation and corpo-\nrate practice.\u201d1\n\u201cSelf-help organisa-\ntions are largely\ninvolved in planning\nand decision-making\nin the extra-parlia-\nmentary and parlia-\nmentary domains on\na municipal, state\nand federal level,\nand so decisions are\nnot taken on the dis-\nabled, but with the\ndisabled.\u201d3\ning the responsibility of disabled persons for their own concerns and care.\nThe Severely Disabled Persons Act is to be revised to reflect these points. \nThe Federation of German Employer Associations and the German govern-\nment are against the draft of a \u201cCouncil directive on the establishment of a\ngeneral framework for realising equal treatment in employment and occu-\npations\u201c presented by the European Commission in the Treaty of\nAmsterdam.  They fear is that if a general anti-discrimination policy simi-\nlar to that of the USA becomes part of the European social model, protection\nof the principle of equality in German employment and social law would be\nlimited, and that would impact persons with disabilities. \nThere are differences of opinion regarding the disabled persons fee which\ncompanies can pay when they do not hire the proportion of severely disabled\npersons mandated by law.  The Federation of German Employer\nAssociations pleads: \u201cfor a lowering of the currently excessive mandatory\nemployment quota from 6 to 5 % and for deletion of the 5-day additional hol-\niday for the severely disabled, which is no longer necessary in view of the\ntariff-related and statutory holiday entitlement of around 6 or 4 weeks.\u201d2\nThe German Trades Union Confederation, however, calls for better use and\nincreased effectiveness of legal instruments to enforce the duty of employ-\ners to hire disabled persons. \nNon-governmental organisations (NGOs)\nIn recent decades, self-help groups and organisations  of and for disabledpersons have made an essential contribution to social policy and have pro-\nvided individualised and flexible help and support.  In addition, NGOs are\nresponsible for large areas of state-financed professional rehabilitation. \nThe following is a list of organisations for people with disabilities.  It does\nnot claim to be comprehensive:  \nAktion Grundgesetz : Kampagne f\u00fcr ein Diskriminierungsverbot \nAktion Mensch\nArbeiterwohlfahrt (AWo), Bonn \nArbeitsgemeinschaft Behinderte in den Medien (ABM) e.V. \nBundesarbeitsgemeinschaft \u201cHilfe f\u00fcr Behinderte\u201d (BAGH) \nClub Behinderter und ihrer Freunde (CeBeeF) Frankfurt \nDeutscher Behindertenrat (DBR) \nDeutscher parit\u00e4tischer Wohlfahrtsverband e.V.

The proportion of those affected by various mental strains is about\n20 \u2013 40%, depending on the type of strain, above that of those who suffer\nfrom more traditional strains.  Mention is made here very frequently of\n\u201chigh demands on concentration\u201d (62%) and \u201cheavy pressure of deadlines\nand performance\u201d (55%).\u201d1\nThese survey results reflect the change in the strain structure and the\ngrowing importance of mental strains due to changes in workplace values. \n\u201cA breakdown according to sectors, occupational groups, occupational qual-\nification, and sex reveals clear differences.  High pressure in terms of per-\nformance and deadlines is experienced in processing industry by between\n50% and 80% of workers, depending on the sector.  In the service sector\nthese figures fluctuate between about 40% and 70%. \nThere are clear differences between East and West Germany, apart from a\nfew individual types of strain.  Working people in the East report more fre-\nquently about strains. This is especially marked with regard to physical\nand environmental strains.  In the case of mental strains the differences\nare smaller.  Sometimes the impact in this area is even higher in the West.\nThe number of working people affected in the East is also higher with\nrespect to multiple strains.  Only 31% of those questioned say they are not\nsubject to any physical or environmental strain (West: 43%).\u201d2\nHealth and safety issues\nIn Germany, it is generally acknowledged that comprehensive corporatehealth protection must take greater account of job stress issues, such as\nburnout, depression and mobbing3. Mental health stress in the workplace\nis increasing because of the introduction of new technologies and a growing\nintensification of work.\nFor years, individual German trade unions and the German Trades Union\nConfederation have been concerned about negative psychological influ-\nences in the workplace such as stress and mobbing.  However, employers\u2019\nassociations and the Expert Groups for Occupational Safety and Health are\nonly beginning to discuss these issues.   Regarding the new Occupational\nSafety and Health Act and the new code of social law the German Trades\nUnion Confederation4 states that the additional tasks of occupational\nphysicians include offering advice on mental stress.  However, \u201cin practice\nthe implementation of the new legal provisions still faces an unusually\nlarge number of difficulties and obstacles. In particular the competent occu-\n19\nIn the workplace,\nmental health prob-\nlems are mainly trig-\ngered by overload\nor underutilisation\nof capabilities.\npational safety and health institutions are often out of their depth with the\nnew, wide-ranging tasks.\u201d5\nTrade unions repeatedly draw attention to the mental factors related to\nwork at computer terminals and their influence on overall health.  The\nworking culture of offices is under growing scrutiny because of the increased\npace and concentration which come with modern technology.  Dickhausen,\nthe Administrative Director of the German Trade Union Confederation,\ndraws attention to \u201cthe resulting mental strains in the workplace, [which]\nrepresent a health impairment which must be taken seriously.\u201d6\nThe social partners, like government institutions, the employers\u2019 liability\ninsurance associations, and the health insurance agencies, agree on the\nnecessity of progressive concepts for prevention which aim to reduce psy-\nchological and mental stress and which specifically include the promotion of\nhealth within companies. \nA study published in 1997 on the \u201cDesign of work requirements with respect\nto mental health and safe conduct\u201d7 points out that the restrictive content of\nwork has an adverse effect on the genesis of anxiety-induced stress states,\nespecially among elderly employees.  The authors come to the following very\nimportant conclusion, however:\n\u201cAn incorrect and fatal consequence would be to search for \u201cage-appropri-\nate\u201d, simple activities; an approach which is unfortunately still seen as the\nway to create a humane work design. Especially since the related restric-\ntiveness has precisely the opposite effect of worsening the problem.  The\nresults point rather to the need for work design concepts which permit a\nlifespan-appropriate solution by means of an optional and flexible adapta-\ntion of working structures to human resources.\u201d8\nThough statistical evidence is limited, we know that job stress also influ-\nences the rate of workplace accidents.  The Federal Institute for\nOccupational Safety and Health attributed \u201conly\u201d 1% of all fatal accidents in\n1993 to physical-mental causes.9. It is still unclear, however, how many\ninstances of workplace stress are concealed behind the 43% of accidents\nattributed to behavioural causes. \nIn the workplace, mental health problems are mainly triggered by overload\nor underutilisation of capabilities.  These work-related influences can lead\nto a deterioration of existing physical or psychological complaints, to stom-\nach ulcers. heart and circulatory disorders, depressions and addiction.  In\nthe early 1980s a study of 840 employees in 10 German industrial compa-\nnies yielded alarming results10: It showed that female workers had worse\nmental health than male workers did.  All employees were subject to job\n20\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45\nw ork overload\nw orkload\nexcessive\nresponsibilities\ntime related pressure\nmen\nw omen\nall\nMental stressors in the workplace (Source: www.ergo-online.de)\nAccording to a defi-\nnition arrived at by\nthe European Union\nand the European\nEconomic Area, cor-\nporate health promo-\ntion encompasses\nall joint measures\ntaken by employees,\nemployers, and soci-\nety to improve well-\nness and health in\nthe workplace.\nstress factors, which included job insecurity, blocking of promotional oppor-\ntunities, deadline pressure, and underutilisation of capabilities. \nThe study concludes that mental health complaints and absenteeism were\nboth attributable to negative working conditions.  The greatest absenteeism\ncame with monotonous, repetitive activities, and the lowest with complex,\ndemanding activities.  Mental health complaints occur more frequently with\nmonotonous, repetitive activities than with more highly skilled tasks11.\nSymptoms grow if employees are afraid of losing their job.  Other stress fac-\ntors result from contradictions between occupational expectations and\nopportunities to realise them, overload or underutilisation, and conflicts\nwith superiors and co-workers.  \nCorporate health promotion\nWithin the framework of a network for corporate health promotion,member states of the European Union and the countries of the\nEuropean Economic Area have arrived at common definition of corporate\nhealth promotion12.  According to this definition, corporate health promo-\ntion encompasses all joint measures taken by employees, employers, and\nsociety to improve wellness and health in the workplace.  There are three\nstrategies for attaining this objective:13\n\u2022 Improving work organisation and working conditions,\n\u2022 Promoting active employee participation,\n\u2022 Reinforcing personal areas of competence. \nOver the past few years, interest in corporate health promotion at the\nnational level and in Europe has grown considerably.  In 1989, Germany\npassed the Health Reform Act, which established health promotion and pre-\nvention as responsibilities of the statutory health insurance schemes, which\nthen set up appropriate infrastructures. \nCorporate health promotion can be approached14:\n\u2022 In the context of behaviour modification and health education in the\nworkplace\n\u2022 As a component of corporate occupational safety and health;\n\u2022 As a strategy for reducing sickness-related absenteeism;\n\u2022 As a combination of health-appropriate work design and health edu-\ncation;\n\u2022 As a component of organisational development and management\nsystems.\nHistorically, corporate health promotion began as a series of measures to\nprevent selected risk factors in the area of heart and circulatory disorders.\nIt was later extended to preventing combined physical and psychological\nrisk factors.  A qualitative leap forward came with the combination of meas-\nures for health-appropriate work design, education, and the dissemination\nof information.  This was supported by occupational safety and health leg-\nislation at the European level and by applying the WHO policy on health\npromotion to the workplace. \nIn Germany, the social partners have developed a special understanding of\ncorporate health promotion, especially against the background of enduring\npublic debate about the economic situation and the issue of labour costs.\nCorporate health promotion is seen as a vehicle for solving the absenteeism\nproblem and reducing the resulting wage costs. \n21\nCorporate health\npromotion is seen\nas a vehicle for solv-\ning the absenteeism\nproblem and reduc-\ning the resulting\nwage costs.\nThe most recent step in the development of health promotion links it to\norganisational development and management.  Particular attention has\nbeen given to linking health promotion to quality systems.  A similar\napproach can be reported in the field of occupational safety and health. \nSUCCESS FACTORS OF CORPORATE HEALTH PROMOTION\nPractical experience and scientific evaluation reveal that successful health\npromotion programmes depend on the following factors:15\n\u2022 Participation:  All parties involved, especially employees, must be\nactively included in all phases of corporate health promotion.\n\u2022 Integration:  Corporate health promotion must be taken into\naccount in all major decision-making areas.  This includes integrating it into\nexisting management systems.\n\u2022 Holism:  Corporate health promotion encompasses both psychoso-\ncial and environmental issues.  Risk reduction should be linked with the\nexpansion of policies and programmes which include all aspects of occupa-\ntional health and safety.\n\u2022 Project management: Corporate health promotion measures must\nbe implemented systematically.  Ideally, they should be integrated into a\nprocess of continuous improvement, be data-supported, and communicated\nappropriately internally and externally.\nCORPORATE HEALTH PROMOTION AND WORKPLACE STRESS PREVENTION\nPreventing stress in the workplace can be addressed through:\n\u2022 Stress reduction programs;\n\u2022 Individual advice and team supervision;\n\u2022 Measures relating to health-appropriate work design and organisa-\ntional development.\n\u2022 Stress reduction programmes\nIn Germany, many types of relaxation training procedures have been devel-\noped for the workplace.  They are targeted at stressed employees in general\nand human resource managers in particular.  Stress reduction programs\nhave been designed which include relaxation procedures, role playing, and\nbehavioural training to increase self-confidence and improve interpersonal\nskills.\nUntil the responsibilities of the statutory health insurance schemes changed\nin 1997, stress reduction was one of their main prevention activities.  In\nGermany, stress reduction programmes have been delivered mainly through\nevening institutes and independent providers of adult education.  For man-\nagement personnel, providers include management consultancy companies,\nfreelance consultants, and personnel developers.  Though there is no empir-\nical data available on the spread and acceptance of these procedures, it can\nbe assumed that they are very much in demand despite changes on the\nprovider side. \n\u2022 Individual advice and team supervision.  Though we cannot\ngive a full description of the models on which these are based, they include\nall the methods and concepts applied in psychotherapy.  It is not possible to\nidentify any empirical details on the spread of these procedures.\n\u2022 Health-appropriate work design and organisational develop-\nment.  There is a specific concept in Germany called the \u201chealth circle\u201d.  It\n22\nHealth circles are\nvehicles for tackling\nstressful working\nconditions and pro-\nviding for health\npromotion through a\ncontinuous process\nof improvement.\nThe health circle\napproach has been\nsuccessful in many\nGerman companies. \nserves to identify suggestions on improving working conditions which are\ndetrimental to health so that improvement can begin. \nHealth circles are add hoc committees which include employees, superiors\nand representatives of all other groups and functions involved (company\ndoctor, human resources department, works council, occupational safety\netc.). They have meetings of limited duration in which they construct and\nprioritise a catalogue of identified stresses and suggest ways for addressing\nthem.  The findings of the circles are reported back to the working group\nwhich uses them as a basis for initiating decisions.\nThe adjacent figure shows a\nsimplified model of this proce-\ndure.\nInitially, the framework for\nimplementing the health circle\nmust be energetically champi-\noned by people within the com-\npany with support from outside\nexperts, if necessary.  The proce-\ndure begins by setting up a work-\ning group in which all stakehold-\ners, including decision-makers,\nare involved.  The working group\nconducts a needs analysis, mod-\nelled on the appraisal reports\ndrawn up by statutory health\ninsurance agencies in connection with the analysis of sickness-related\nabsenteeism.  The analysis helps to pinpoint problems within the company,\nwhich should be the starting points for planning measures.  Subsequently\nproblem areas, i.e. departments or plants with above-average sickness-\nrelated absenteeism, will be identified for the consideration by health cir-\ncles.\nSuggestions from the health circles make it possible to tackle stressful\nworking conditions and provide for health promotion through a continuous\nprocess of improvement. The health circle approach has been successful in\nmany Germany companies.  The health circle philosophy is consensus-driv-\nen and depends on a constructive relationship between the social partners.\nEvaluation studies on health circles testify to their high level of acceptance.\nData on the implementation of their improvement proposals demonstrate\ntheir effectiveness. \nQUALITY ASSURANCE AND INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS\nLinking of quality management and corporate health promotion is another\nstep in corporate stress prevention.  It is distinguished by the fact that it\nincludes central organisational structures and processes.\nRecently, occupational safety and health agencies and the public health sec-\ntor have initiated a discussion on the connection between corporate health\npromotion and management systems, particularly quality systems, in\nGermany and in other European Union countries.  Using an approach based\non the European Business Excellence Model, Germany has led the\nEuropean network for corporate health promotion in developing European\nquality criteria, which served to identify and document successful models in\nnearly 20 countries. \n23\nworking group\nhealth circle\ncompany health report\ntask\ntask\nresults\nresults\n1\n3\n2\nREWE regards the\nhealth protection of\nits employees as a\nsocial obligation\nand an economic\nnecessity.\nThe European Business Excellence Model, which is the basis for the\nEuropean Award for Total Quality Management, also served as the basis for\nthe evaluation model for corporate health promotion which Germany devel-\noped for its statutory health insurance system.  Concurrently, in the context\nof the discussion on occupational safety and health management systems,\nmembers of Germany\u2019s occupational safety and health community have pro-\nduced an important document for the evaluation of these systems which\naddresses the most relevant issues in corporate health promotion\nCorporate health promotion in German companies:\nCase studies\nREWE HANDELSGRUPPE\nBranch: Trading\nNo. of employees: 210,000 in Europe, 170,000 in Germany\nProducts/Services: Food, non-food and services\nLocations: 12,000 branches in Europe, 9,500 in Germany\nMiscellaneous:             76% women, 60% part-time workers\nREWE regards the health protection of its employees as a social obligation\nand an economic necessity.  Matters of occupational health and safety are\nviewed as management tasks and are regularly dealt with in seminars and\ntraining courses.\nBroad alliance and thorough planning\nAt REWE, a national working group on health controls all health-related\nmeasures.  This group comprises 25-30 members from the REWE compa-\nnies, its branches and headquarters.  They include the head of the social\ndepartment of the central organisation, the leading occupational safety and\nhealth officer, members of works councils, human resources branch man-\nagers, representatives of the employers\u2019 liability insurance association and\nthe company health insurance fund, as well as external consultants from\nresearch institutes and from the Federal Association of Company Health\nInsurance Funds. \nSince 1993 health reports have been prepared every year to help detect any\nirregularities in the sickness profile of the company.  With industrial acci-\ndent statistics and data from stress analyses, they serve as a basis for plan-\nning health promotion. \nREWE has participated in several research projects.  In the \u201cKOPAG\u201d proj-\nect on the prevention of work-related illnesses, health risks were surveyed\nin the warehouse, in sales, at the cash registers, and in the transport sector.\nThe organisation of work improved accordingly.  Another project was geared\nto pooling all activities relating to occupational health and safety and work-\nplace health promotion and integrating them into the company processes.\nIn order to improve ergonomically work at the cash register, new till stools\nand tables were developed.  Health circles have been set up in work areas\nwhere job stress has been identified as a serious factor affecting employee\nhealth.  Many measures for reducing stress have been introduced through\nimproved workplace design and organisation of work.  Employees who fre-\nquently transport heavy loads are trained in good posture, and the executive\nteam attends seminars on promoting health through staff leadership.\nThanks to the wide variety of health-related activities, REWE has been able\nto substantially reduce work stress for its employees.  As a result, the work-\ning atmosphere and staff satisfaction have improved considerably, leading\nto greater customer satisfaction.\n24\nAt Volkswagen AG,\nextensive health pro-\nmotion measures\nare having an impact\nand are paying divi-\ndends: Physical\nstress in the work-\nplace has been sub-\nstantially reduced,\nthrough, for exam-\nple, the elimination\nof overhead work.\nOver a period of four years, absenteeism due to illness fell by 0.8% to 5.7%,\nand the number of industrial accidents has almost halved over the last 10\nyears.\nVOLKSWAGEN AG\nBranch: Automobile Industry\nNo. of employees: 104,000 \nProducts/Services: Cars\nLocations:                    6 plants in Germany, headquarters in Wolfsburg\nAt Volkswagen AG, the Group Management Board and central works coun-\ncil have set out guidelines on occupational health and safety and health pro-\nmotion which outline minimum standards world-wide.  Guidelines on\nhealth management also apply to all domestic factories.  Every year, about\nDM 260 is invested per employee in occupational health and safety and\nhealth promotion.\nHealth management at VW is controlled and co-ordinated by the health\ndepartment, the occupational health and safety committees of the individ-\nual plants and the \u201chealth working groups,\u201d if available.  The health depart-\nment, occupational safety department, works council, and company health\ninsurance fund are also represented in these working groups.  Discussions\non occupational health and safety are held every year.\nA comprehensive company health reporting system serves as the basis for\nplanning.  The results of risk analyses, occupational medical check-ups,\nstaff surveys, as well as analyses of absenteeism due to illness and incapac-\nity to work are taken into account.\nAt VW the employees participate in many health related activities such as\nhealth groups, ideas management, special workshops, surveys and the \u201ctry-\nout\u201d method.\nThe company has created a wide variety of programmes to promote health-\nconscious behaviour among the employees, such as back and posture cours-\nes, lifting/carrying, fitness training courses, and relaxation courses.  A\nworks agreement on co-operative behaviour in the workplace clearly indi-\ncates that the company actively combats bullying, sexual harassment, and\nracism.\nThese extensive measures are having an impact and are paying dividends:\nPhysical stress in the workplace has been substantially reduced, through,\nfor example, the elimination of overhead work.  Between 1991 and 1998 the\nhealth rate rose from 91.6% to 96% while the number of industrial accidents\nfell from 13.7% to 10.7% per one million hours worked.  Targeted occupa-\ntional health and safety measures have provided financial benefits because\ncertain medical check-ups are no longer necessary.  At Wolfsburg works, for\nexample, this has resulted in significant savings.   At another factory the\nnumber of days lost due to contact dermatitis was reduced by about 1,000\ndays with a prevention programme called \u201cSkin\u201d.  As a result of the intro-\nduction of therapeutic measures for 25 alcoholic employees, the number of\nsick days in this group fell within a year from 1420 to only 351 per year.\n25\nThis page has been left blank intentionally.\nCONCLUSION\nIn Germany, both the social partners and the institutions responsible forhealth and safety in the workplace pay great attention to mental strain\nand stress in the workplace.  Successful prevention programmes have\nalready been in place for many years in this area.  This is a response to\ndevelopments and changes taking place in the world of work and work\norganisation.\nA statistical analysis of the group of disorders known as depression is dif-\nficult in Germany.  There are no statistical details on mental health dis-\nability and type of employment, unemployment or rehabilitation because\nthe Federal Statistics Office makes no distinction between mental/emo-\ntional disabilities and paraplegia, cerebral disorders or addictive illnesses.\nAs a result, in Germany, epidemiological information regarding mental ill-\nnesses or  mental health disabilities is limited.\nCare at the workplace, including the prevention of illnesses, and the reha-\nbilitation of disabled persons is addressed through a comprehensive and\ndifferentiated social insurance system with branches in unemployment\ninsurance, statutory health insurance, and statutory accident insurance\nfunds.  Yet, again, there is no statistical information regarding the number\nof persons concerned with mental health disabilities.\nStudies assume that more than half of all depressive disorders are still not\nrecognised by physicians.  An improvement in initial and further training\nis urgently needed, mainly in the domain of general medical practice.  The\nfocal points should be diagnosis and suicide prevention.\nDespite growing efforts made over the last decade to research the reasons\nfor the genesis and persistence of depressive disorders, the present state of\nknowledge is inadequate.  To change this it would help to implement tar-\ngeted promotion of interdisciplinary research approaches, integrating neu-\nrobiology, psychophysiology and cognitive psychology.  In view of the\nincreased risk that the children of depressive parents will themselves\ndevelop a psychiatric disorder during their lifetime, it would be important\nto know more about illness-inducing or health-promoting family-related\nfactors.1\nMental health disorders display high prevalence rates.  Although the level\nof research in psychology provides favourable conditions for the develop-\nment of suitable prevention measures, there have, to date, only been a lim-\nited number of implemented and tested prevention programmes.\nMoreover, only a few research programmes have addressed the develop-\nment and evaluation of disorder-specific prevention programmes which can\nbe applied in practice \n26\nIn Germany, strain\nand stress in the\nworkplace are of\ngreat concern to the\nsocial partners and\ninstitutions responsi-\nble for workplace\nhealth and safety.\nThis page has been left blank intentionally.\nNOTES\nINTRODUCTION\n1.

This will result in an overview of the herds \nand allow for potential adaptations for the organic situation (e.g. \npasture systems, longer cow/calf contact). For calves, a special \nsystem will be developed by the Norwegian partners, and \ncombined and tested together with the WelfareQuality \nassessment system assessment system.   \n\u2022 Develop guidelines for communication about animal health and \nwelfare promotion in different settings.

Organisational factors are thus relatively\neasy to tackle. Future research designs should allow\nresearchers to interview healthcare providers that were\ninvolved in the event, as an additional source of\ninformation on contributing factors.\nSeveral studies in various countries have shown\nthat a substantial number of patients experience\nadverse events (AEs) in hospitals.\n1e9 These studies\nhave reported AE incidence rates ranging from 2.9%\nto 16.6% of all hospital admissions. Of the AEs, 25%\nto 50% were considered preventable, and in 5% to\n13% of the AEs the patient died. The studies on the\nincidence of AEs have enlarged the sense of urgency\nto take effective countermeasures to increase\npatient safety in hospitals. Reduction of AEs can\nonly be achieved if these interventions tackle the\ndominant underlying causes. To explore the causes\nof AEs and to gain more insight into potential\nprevention strategies, we carried out additional\nanalyses of data that were gathered in the Dutch\npatient record review study.\n91 0\nIn accordance with the theoretical framework of\nReason,\n11 the focus of our study was on active\nhuman behavioural failures and on latent factors\npresent within the system (organisational and\ntechnical factors) before an accident sequence\ninvolving human behaviour actually begins. In\nother words, healthcare providers\u2019 behaviour was\nnot the single point of attention; the conditions\nunder which they work were considered important\nas welldfor example, the design of equipment that\nhealthcare providers have to work with or the\nnumber of staff installed by hospital management.\nWhen planning quality and patient safety inter-\nventions in hospitals, information about prevention\nstrategies that tackle the causal factors to prevent\nfuture AEs is valuable. Perhaps the most effective\nstrategies to reduce AEs are improving technology,\noptimising procedures or training programmes for\nhealthcare providers. Therefore, the reviewers in our\nstudy assessed potential prevention strategies next\nto the causes of the AEs. This information can be an\naid for policy-makers in healthcare.\nThe objectives of our study were to gain more\ninsight into (a) the causes of AEs, (b) the relation-\nship between the causes of AEs and the prevent-\nability and health consequences of the AEs, (c)\npotential prevention strategies to prevent AEs and\n(d) the relevance of the prevention strategies for\neach main causal factor type.\nMETHODS\nStudy design and setting\nA retrospective patient record review study was\nconducted to examine AEs in Dutch hospitals with\na strati\ufb01ed random sample of 21 hospitals: 4\nuniversity, 6 tertiary teaching and 11 general\nhospitals. From each hospital, a strati\ufb01ed random\nsample was selected of 200 admissions of patients\ndischarged from the hospital in 2004 (>24 h stay)\nand 200 (or less if the total of patients who died in\n2004 was lower) admissions of patients deceased in\nthe hospital in 2004, excluding admissions of\npsychiatry, obstetrics and children <1 year old.\nAdmissions of deceased patients and patients\nadmitted to university hospitals were oversampled.\nThe methods of determining AEs were based on\nprevious AE studies in other countries and have\nbeen described in detail elsewhere.\n10\nStructured review of patient records\nBetween August 2005 and October 2006, 55 trained\nphysicians reviewed the medical, nursing and, if\n1NIVEL, Netherlands Institute for\nHealth Services Research,\nUtrecht, The Netherlands\n2Department of Sociology and\nDepartment of Human\nGeography, Utrecht University,\nUtrecht, The Netherlands\n3EMGO Institute, Department of\nPublic and Occupational Health,\nVU University Medical Center,\nAmsterdam, The Netherlands\nCorrespondence to\nMarleen Smits, NIVEL,\nNetherlands Institute for Health\nServices Research, PO Box\n1568, 3500 BN Utrecht, The\nNetherlands; m.smits@nivel.nl\nAccepted 6 March 2009\nPublished Online First\n8 February 2010\nQual Saf Health Care 2010;19:e5. doi:10.1136/qshc.2008.030726 1o f7\nOriginal research\n  group.bmj.com  on July 9, 2012 - Published by  qualitysafety.bmj.com Downloaded from available, outpatient record of all sampled admissions that\ncontained triggers (clues) for AEsdfor example, an unplanned\nreadmission, unplanned return to the operating room or unex-\npected death. The presence of one or more of the 18 prede\ufb01ned\ntriggers was judged in advance by trained nurses. For each patient\nrecord, two physician reviewers determined independently the\npresence, consequences and degree of preventability of the AEs,\nbased on a standardised procedure and review form. An AE was\nde\ufb01ned as an unintended injury among hospitalised patients that\nresults in disability, death or prolonged hospital stay, and was\ncaused by healthcare management. Preventable refers to care that\nfell below the current level of expected performance for practi-\ntioners or systems. Disability was de\ufb01ned as temporary or\npermanent impairment of physical or mental function attribut-\nable to the AE (including prolonged or strengthened treatment,\nreadmission and death).\n10\nIn total, 7926 patient records were reviewed. The reviewers\nidenti\ufb01ed 744 AEs in the records. When generalised to all\nhospital admissions, the AE incidence rate was 5.7% (corrected\nfor overrepresentation of patients admitted to a university\nhospital and patients who died in hospital). Forty per cent of the\nAEs were considered preventable and 12.8% resulted in perma-\nnent disability (including death). Detailed results of this study\nare reported in a previous publication.\n9\nPart of the review procedure was an assessment of the\nunderlying causes and prevention strategies of each AE as judged\nby the physician reviewers. The review form presented \ufb01ve main\ncausal factor categories to choose from: technical, human,\norganisational, patient-related and other. For each AE, reviewers\nselected one or more of these main causal factors based on the\ninformation in the medical record and their perception of the\nsituation. Having opted technical, organisational and/or human\ncauses, reviewers selected one or more subcategories of causal\nfactors within these main categories. The causal factor cate-\ngories were derived from a recognised taxonomy of root causes:\nthe Eindhoven Classi\ufb01cation Model (ECM) of PRISMA-Medical,\na root cause analysis tool.\n12 13 The taxonomy includes concepts\nof the theoretical frameworks of Reason\n11 and Rasmussen.\n14\nReason\u2019s system approach to accident causation can be seen in\nthe recognition of latent factors (organisational and technical)\nnext to active failures (human). The human categories of the\nECM \ufb01t in the skill-rules-knowledge framework (SRK frame-\nwork) of Rasmussen (see Box 1).\nReason used the SRK framework for his Model of Unsafe\nActs, in which \u201cviolation\u201d is added to the basic error types of the\nSRK framework.\n11 Violations are deliberate deviations from rules\nor procedures. The ECM does not cover the concept of violations.\nWe have added violations to the taxonomy to cover all concepts\nof the Model of Unsafe Acts. In table 1, the main causal factor\ncategories and subcategories are listed and explained.\nBeside the causal factor categories, the review form distin-\nguished 10 prevention strategies (table 2). The categories were\nbased on PRISMA\n13 and the Canadian patient record review\nstudy.\n7 For each AE, the reviewers could select one or more\nprevention strategies that they judged relevant for the AE.\nThere were two reviewers per AE. Both reviewers could select\nmore than one cause and more than one prevention strategy per\nAE. We reported all causes and prevention strategies that were\nselected by this panel of two physicians irrespective of whether\none or both reviewers selected the particular cause or prevention\nstrategy. We wanted to \ufb01nd a broad variety of indications to\nimprove patient safety in our exploratory study and we did not\nintend the reviewers to reach a shared conclusion. Because there\nis a lot of information in patient records, the likelihood of\nmissing a causal factor (false negative) will be larger than the\nlikelihood that a causal factor is selected mistakenly when in\nreality it does not exist (false positive). Thus, reviewers were\nconsidered complementary to each other.\nWhen both reviewers selected the same causal factor or\nprevention strategy for an AE, these were counted only once in\nthe analyses.\nStatistical analysis\nCauses of AEs and prevention strategies were analysed using\ndescriptive statistics and frequency tables. Frequencies were\ncalculated using weights that corrected for overrepresentation of\npatients admitted to a university hospital and for over-\nrepresentation of patients who died in hospital. The sampling\nweight was the inverse of the probability of being included in\nthe sample owing to the sampling design.\n9\nFor 8 of the 744 AEs, neither of the reviewers \ufb01lled out any of\nthe items in the review form about causal factors. Consequently,\nresults on causal factors will be presented for 736 AEs. For the\nprevention strategies, results of the 315 AEs that were consid-\nered preventable will be presented. All statistical analyses were\nperformed using SPSS V.14.0.\nRESULTS\nCauses of AEs (objectives a and b)\nThe 736 AEs were associated with 1017 main causal factors\nbecause reviewers could select more than one category per AE.\nFigure 1 presents the weighted percentages of the \ufb01ve main\ncausal factor categories. Human causes were predominantly\ninvolved in AE causation (in 61% of the AEs). In 39% of the AEs,\npatient-related factors were involved. In 14% of the AEs, organ-\nisational factors contributed to the AE, in 4% technical factors\nand in 19% other factors.\nOrganisational factors had a relatively high proportion of AEs\nthat were preventable (out of all AEs with an organisational\ncause involved, 93% was considered preventable), followed by\nhuman causes (61% of all AEs with human causes). Organisa-\ntional factors also had a relatively high proportion of AEs that\nled to permanent disability (20%). Technical factors had low\nproportions of preventable AEs (22%) and AEs resulting in\nBox 1 Skill-based, rules-based and knowledge-based\nbehaviour\n14\nTo understand the mechanisms behind human error, Rasmussen\ndeveloped the skill-rules-knowledge framework (SRK frame-\nwork), with the notion that human behaviour can be controlled at\ndifferent levels of conscious control, dependent on the degree of\nfamiliarity with the task and the environment. At the skill-based\nlevel, behaviour is regulated by the lowest level of conscious\ninvolvement and is characteristic of highly routinised and auto-\nmated activities. The individual is seldom able to verbalise how\nperformance of the behaviour is controlled or explain the infor-\nmation on which the performance is based. Rule-based behaviour\nrequires some degree of conscious involvement; at this level,\nbehaviour is controlled by stored rules derived from experience or\nother\u2019s know-how. At this level, performance is typically based\non speci\ufb01c ability and the rules for performance can be verbal-\nised. At the knowledge-based level, stored rules do no longer\napply and a novel situation is presented for which a plan must be\ndeveloped to solve a problem. Here, the individual uses\nconceptual reasoning or trial-and-error.\n2o f7 Qual Saf Health Care 2010;19:e5. doi:10.1136/qshc.2008.030726\nOriginal research\n  group.bmj.com  on July 9, 2012 - Published by  qualitysafety.bmj.com Downloaded from Table 1 Explanation of causal factors categories\nMain category Subcategory Code Description\nLatent conditions\nTechnical Design TD Failures due to poor design of equipment,\nsoftware, labels or forms\nConstruction TC Correct design, which was not constructed\nproperly or was set up incorrectly\nMaterials TM Material defects\nExternal T-ex Technical failures beyond the control and\nresponsibility of the investigating organisation\nOrganisational Transfer of knowledge OK Failures resulting from inadequate measures\ntaken to ensure that situational or domain-speci\ufb01c\nknowledge or information is transferred to all new\nor inexperienced staff\nProtocols OP Failures relating to the quality and availability of\nthe protocols within the department (too\ncomplicated, inaccurate, unrealistic, absent or\npoorly presented)\nManagement priorities OM Internal management decisions in which safety is\nrelegated to an inferior position when faced with\ncon\ufb02icting demands or objectives.

In the subgroup of AEs that\nwere preventable and led to permanent disability, the distribu-\ntion of causal factors shows that in these AEs there were nearly\nalways human causes involved (94%), frequently organisational\n(36%) and patient-related causes (33%), and rarely technical\ncauses (1%) (\ufb01gure 2).\nFor the technical, human and organisational categories, one or\nmore speci\ufb01c subcategories of causes were selected as well. The\nresults are presented in table 3 (see also Appendix for examples).\nMaterial defects were the most common technical factors (34%\nof all AEs with technical causes). Contrary to the other technical\nfactors,materialdefects wereallassociatedwith preventableAEs.\nHuman causes were predominantly knowledge based (46% of\nall AEs with human causes) and/or related to rule-based failures\nregarding monitoring (27%), intervention (26%) and/or veri\ufb01ca-\ntion (21%). These causal factors, as well as violations, were asso-\nciated with large proportions of preventable AEs (74% to 89%).\nTransfer of knowledge was the most frequent organisational\nfactor contributing to AEs (50% of all AEs with organisational\ncauses).

Quality assurance/peer review was the\nmost frequently selected strategy (65%), followed by evaluation\n(53%) training (50%) and procedures (40%). Financial invest-\nments, up-scaling of the problem to a higher organisational level\nand increasing the number of personnel were least often\nconsidered as relevant methods to prevent AEs (2% to 3%).\nFor the AEs with human and patient-related causes, reviewers\npredominantlyrecommendedqualityassurance/peerreview(68%\nand 78%, respectively). AEs caused by organisational factors were\nconsidered preventable by improving procedures (67%).\nDISCUSSION\nGeneral \ufb01ndings\nThe study provides an initial overview of causes of AEs and\nrequired remedial action. The causes identi\ufb01ed by the reviewers\nwere predominantly related to human errors, especially knowl-\nedge-based and rule-based errorsdfor example, incorrect\nreasoning by a healthcare provider or not verifying if all necessary\ninstruments were present before the start of a procedure. AEs\nwith organisational factors involved were relatively often\npreventable and resulted relatively often in permanent disability,\nparticularly AEs caused by inadequate or unavailable protocols.\nOverall, technical factors (eg, an inadequate construction of\nequipment) contributed relatively less often to preventable AEs\nand AEsresulting in permanent disability.However,the technical\nfactors within the material defects subgroup all contributed to\npreventable AEs.\nTable 2 Explanation of prevention strategy categories\nPrevention strategies Description\nTechnology/equipment Redesigning of hardware, software or interface parts of the manemachine system\nProcedures Completing or improving formal and informal procedures\nInformation and communication Completing or improving available sources of information and communication structures\nTraining Improving (re)training programmes for skills needed\nMotivation Increasing the level of voluntary obedience to generally accepted rules by applying principles of positive behaviour modi\ufb01cation\nUp-scaling Handling the problem at a higher organisational leveldeg, hospital department or hospital management level\nEvaluation Evaluating the current way of behaving regarding safety\nQuality assurance/peer review Continuously monitoring of data quality based on prespeci\ufb01ed standards and assessment of a health professional\u2019s performance\nby one or more individuals in the same \ufb01eld\nFinancial investment Financial investments in required areasdeg, increasing the availability of facilities and equipment\nPersonnel Increasing the number of personnel\nDescriptions of \ufb01rst six prevention strategies derived from Van der Schaaf and Habraken.\n13\nFigure 1 Percentages are weighted for over-sampling of deceased\npatients and patients admitted to a university hospital (N: actualnumbers of\ncauses, not weighted).

For AEs\nwith human and patient-related causes, reviewers indicated\nthese could be prevented by quality assurance/peer review. For\nAEs caused by organisational factors, reviewers predominantly\nrecommended completing or improving procedures.\nTo sum up, active failures played a large role in AE causation,\nbut the reviewers also identi\ufb01ed latent factors that were present\nin the system and that contributed to AEs. To tackle active\nhuman causes, which occurred most frequently, quality assur-\nance/peer review was recommended. To deal with latent\norganisational factors, which underlie AEs that were believed to\nbe most preventable and were associated with the most severe\nconsequences, improving procedures was recommended.\nComparison with previous record review studies\nUp to now, two retrospective patient record review studies have\nassessed the causes of the AEs\n15 16 and two have examined\npossible prevention strategies.\n15 17 It is quite dif\ufb01cult to compare\nour results with these and other studies on the causes and\nprevention strategies of AEs because the classi\ufb01cations used vary\nto a large extent and most studies examined the causes of\na speci\ufb01c group of AEs, such as medication errors. However, the\ndesign of the Australian record review study was comparable to\nours.\n21 5Wilson et al\n2 reexamined the 2353 AEs identi\ufb01ed earlier\nand found that AEs in which the cause was a cognitive failure\nwere associated with high preventability scores. This is similar to\nour \ufb01ndings: we found that AEs caused by human errors were\noften preventable, next to AEs caused by organisational factors.\nLatent factors (organisational and technical factors) were not\nexamined in the Australian study. Furthermore, the main\nprevention strategies were comparable to our results: they\nrecommended new or better implemented policies and protocols,\nbetter formal quality monitoring and better education.\n15\nStrengths and limitations\nOur study has some advantages over previous studies on the\ncauses of AEs. Causes and prevention strategies were examined\ndirectly, together with the assessment of the presence of AEs,\ninstead of afterwards. The reviews were thus based on original\nrecords and not on summaries of information compiled for the\nreview, like in the Australian study.\n15 Moreover, we used a clas-\nsi\ufb01cation of causes in \ufb01ve main categories, divided in several\nsubcategories. The categories were based on the well-established\nFigure 2 Percentages are weighted for over-sampling of deceased\npatients and patients admitted to a university hospital (N: actual numbers\nof causes, not weighted). Reviewers could select more than one casual\nfactor per AE. Preventability is related to the assessment of the\npreventabilityof the AE, not the preventability of each cause underlyingthe\nAE.\nTable 3 Causes of AEs (subcategories): proportions with preventable AEs and AEs leading to permanent disability (including death)\nCauses of AEs Frequency\nPercentage (column\n%* within each\nmain category)\nPreventable\nAEs (row %*)\nAEs with\npermanent\ndisability row %*)\nTechnical Design 0 0 0 0\nConstruction 2 21 0 0\nMaterials 10 34 100 0\nExternal 2 24 0 0\nOther 3 22 0 0\nHuman Knowledge based Knowledge 241 46 77 21\nRule based Quali\ufb01cations 32 5 69 14\nCoordination 48 10 89 19\nVeri\ufb01cation 105 21 83 18\nIntervention 84 26 74 19\nMonitoring 96 27 83 17\nSkill based Slips 22 11 37 0\nTripping 5 3 75 0\nExternal 5 2 50 0\nViolation 126 29 81 17\nOther 45 14 40 5\nOrganisational Protocols 32 22 92 33\nTransfer of knowledge 46 50 93 24\nManagement priorities 7 17 100 0\nCulture 30 28 100 13\nExternal 6 5 100 0\nOther 4 4 100 0\nAE, adverse event.\nReviewers could select more than one causal factor per AE.

The usability of a patient\nrecord as a means to examine the causes of AEs is limited. It is\nhard to get information about all contributing factors by reading\nthe patient record only. Human actions are regularly reported on\nin a patient record and therefore human causes are most visible\nfor reviewers. One can imagine that healthcare providers are less\ninclined to note technical or organisational factors in the medical\nor nursing record of an individual patient. This can be an\nexplanation for the relatively small amounts of technical and\norganisational factors found in our study.\nAnother limitation is that there was no contact between the\nreviewers and the involved healthcare professionals to gather\nmore information about the event and contributing factors. This\nwas not possible because of privacy restrictions made before the\nstudy started and because the reviews were performed 1 to\n2 years after the occurrence of the AE. Neale et al\n18 attempted to\novercome these dif\ufb01culties in their pilot study in one UK\nhospital. The clinical staff of the hospital assessed patient\nrecords, shortly after discharge, in combination with external\nreviewers. Clinical teams have \u201cinside\u201d knowledge about the care\nprovided to the patients.\n18\nDespite the limitations, exploratory study has offered an\ninteresting overview of the causes and prevention strategies of\nAEs.\nImplications for practice and future research\nThe Dutch Society of Medical Specialists, among others, has\nformulated a national patient safety action campaign for\nhospitals \u201cPrevent harm, work safely\u201d in 2008. The results of the\npresent study served as input for this safety programme. The\nprogramme includes quality monitoring at department level,\n(team) training, evidence-based procedures and evaluations of the\nIndividual Functioning of Medical Specialists, including the\nconstruction of a personal portfolio, a personal progress plan and\nannual interviews about quality of care and communication with\ncolleagues and patients.\n19\nWe recommend that in future research into causes of AEs\na more prospective design is used in which the period between\nthe occurrence of the AE and the assessment of its causes is only\na few weeks. In that case, involved healthcare providers can be\ninterviewed to provide more information about contributing\nfactors soon after the occurrence of the AE.\nFinally, studies on AEs should use the same taxonomy for\ncauses of AEs to make national and international comparisons of\ncauses of AEs possible. The World Health Organization is\nformulating a taxonomy of patient safety events and contrib-\nuting factors.\n20 21 This taxonomy is partly based on the ECM we\nhave used in our research.\nAcknowledgements We thank everyone who contributed to the study: the\nphysicians who reviewed the patient records, the researchers who coordinated the\ndata collection and the 21 participating hospitals and their staff who facilitated the\npatient records.\nFunding The Dutch Patient Safety Research Program has been initiated by the Dutch\nSociety of Medical Specialists (in Dutch: Orde van Medisch Specialisten) with \ufb01nancial\nsupport from the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport.

Introduction\nIn 2004, the Dutch Advisory Committee on Wad\ue02d\nden Sea Policy suggested a new policy framework \nto set limits to human use in the Wadden Sea \n(Meijer et al., 2004). The framework consists of \na system of \u2018natural limits\u2019 for which scientific \nconsensus exists that as long as these limits are \nnot exceeded, natural processes in the Wadden \nSea would not be significantly influenced. The \nframework sets limits to human use, based on the \npremise that in the Wadden Sea natural features \nstand above human uses. The Committee sug\ue02d\ngested setting up a generic set of natural limits, \nvalid for the entire Wadden Sea and for all types of \nactivities. Once the limits are established, making \nthe appropriate assessment (according to the EU \nHabitats Directive) of a new plan or project in the \nWadden Sea should be easier.\nIn 2007, the Dutch Wadden Council (Raad voor \nde Wadden) published advice on the applicabil\ue02d\nity of natural limits (RVDW, 2007). They gave \na definition for natural limits in which human \nactivities play a more prominent role: \u201ca system of \nlimits for the most important natural parameters, \nlinked to human activities, for which scientific \nconsensus exists that as long as these limits are \nnot exceeded, natural processes in the Wadden \nSea would go undisturbed\u201d. The Council concluded \nthat there should be a system of limits to human \nuse, agreed upon by society, for which the ef\ue02d\nfects of human use lie in between minimum and \nmaximum threshold values for significant change \nof ecosystems (Figure 1).\nVarious workshops have been held with experts \nand policy makers in an effort to elaborate on a \nsystem of natural limits. However, there has been a \nlot of discussion and also confusion on definitions. \nShould we speak of \u2018natural limits\u2019 or rather \u2018user \nlimits\u2019? Are the limits set by the natural processes \nof the Wadden Sea, or rather by policy makers? \nAnd, last but not least, how do we quantify these \nlimits in the light of the complexity and dynamics \nof the Wadden Sea ecosystem, and will they stand \nin legal procedures? \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n194        \nWadden Sea Ecosystem No. 26 \ue02d 2010\nImpacts of Human Activites\nIn this study the feasibility of the proposed \nframework is evaluated from an ecological and \njuridical perspective. Two types of limits were \ndistinguished, those set by law and policy, such \nas the EU Habitats and Birds Directives or the \ntrilateral Eco\ue02dtargets, and those set by ecological \nknowledge, such as carrying capacity and minimal \nviable population size. For salt marshes, mussel \nbeds, bird populations and EU habitat type 1140 \n(intertidal areas) available knowledge was studied \nin more detail and an attempt was made to define \nlimits based on natural processes.\n2. Elaboration on natural limits\nFrom analyzing documents and discussion sessions \non natural limits we concluded that two main \ntypes can be distinguished:\n1. Natural limits that follow from politi\ue02d\ncal or policy decisions; they are documented in \nthe EU Habitats and Birds Directives, the Water \nFramework Directive, the trilateral Eco\ue02dtargets or \nother documents. They specify minimum areas of \nhabitats, or minimum habitat quality, or minimum \nsize of bird populations needed for a good status \nof the ecosystem. They have been specified on \nthe basis of ecosystem knowledge, however, they \ndiffer from Type 2:\n2. Natural limits that follow from ecosys\ue02d\ntem properties, such as carrying capacity, minimal \nviable population size or tipping point of a regime \nshift; they are established on the boundaries of \necosystem components based upon ecological \nthresholds. Two subtypes can be distinguished:\na. Endogenic natural limits, determined by the \nboundaries of the range of natural variability \nFigure 1: \nRelational scheme for natu-\nral limits and user limits. A \nnatural system has a present \ncondition, which is less than \nthe ecological maximum. \nFor increasing levels of \nactivities, the system moves \naway from the maximum \ntowards a critical threshold \nvalue, beyond which signifi-\ncant change of the system \noccurs. Two different limits \ncan be defined for human \nactivities. The natural limit, \nin strict sense, is the critical \nthreshold for significant \nchanges to the natural \nsystem. In fact, the user \nlimit is an agreed limit up \nto which it is certain that \nno significant changes oc-\ncur. In between the present \ncondition and the limits, \nbandwidths of human use \ncan be defined. After Swart \nand Van der Windt (2007).\nwithin which the ecosystem component ex\ue02d\nists.\nb. Exogenic natural limits, determined by proc\ue02d\nesses and (a)biotic characteristics of envi\ue02d\nronmental variables that serve as boundary \nconditions to an ecosystem component.\nIn our view, and in compliance with the defini\ue02d\ntion of the Dutch Advisory Committee on Wad\ue02d\nden Sea Policy, Type 2 is the true natural limit or \nthreshold. Therefore, when the aim is to conserve \ncertain ecosystem characteristics, human pressure \non the ecosystem should never be so large that \nthis limit is reached and a significant change of \nthe system occurs. In practice, a safety margin \nis applied, and additional political reasoning \nwill establish limits of Type 1. We suggest that \nultimately limits to human use will be defined in \nsuch a way that the true natural limits are not \nexceeded. Conforming with the definition of the \nDutch Wadden Council, we prefer to call these \nlimits \u2018user limits\u2019, see Figure 1. An example is gas \nextraction in the Wadden Sea. Subsidence is the \nmajor problem so this activity is allowed as long \nas it does not exceed the natural sedimentation \nrate (a Type 2b natural limit) leading to drowning \nof litoral mudflats (a Type 2a natural limit). In this \ncase the natural sedimentation rate is the natural \nlimit to subsidence and thus to the amount of gas \nto be extracted. Due to coinciding sea level rise \nand safety margins the user limit is lower than \nthe natural limit. The gas is extracted with \u201cthe \nhand on the tap\u201d; if limits are exceeded the gas \nextraction is stopped.\nEcological optimum \nPresent condition \nUser limit : agreed upon limit \nfor human activities \nNatural limit : critical limit \nfor human activities \nMaximum bandwidth for human use \nMinimum bandwidth for human use \nIncreasing activities \nSignificant change \nof the system \nSafety \nmargin \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     195 \nWadden Sea Ecosystem No. 26 \ue02d 2010\nImpacts of Human Activities\nWe have elaborated and defined natural limits \nfor a number of ecosystem components in the \nWadden Sea, i.e. salt marshes, intertidal sand flats \nand mudflats, intertidal mussel beds, and food \navailability for birds and will give examples of Type \n1 and Type 2 natural limits, where possible.\n2.1 Salt marshes (habitats 1310 and \n1330)\nNatural limits for salt marshes can be defined \nfor their quantity and for their quality. A certain \nminimum size is required to have diversity of \ngeomorphology and biotopes, and to give room for \nprocesses of natural rejuvenation. Beeftink (1984) \ndefined a minimum size of 500 ha per site, which \nis a Type 2a natural limit.\nThe quality of a salt marsh is determined by \nthe relative area of vegetation zones. Dijkema et \nal. (2005a) defined a set of (natural) limits to dif\ue02d\nferent vegetation zones to be used for the Water \nFramework Directive. They state that the relative \ndistribution of each zone should lie between a \nminimum of 5% and a maximum of 35% (with \nfive vegetation zones) or 40% (with four vegeta\ue02d\ntion zones). Furthermore, climax\ue02dvegetation may \nnot dominate (more than 50% cover) within its \nzone. Together with similar limits for Natura 2000 \nhabitat types, these are examples of Type 1.  \nRegression from one vegetation type to another \ncan be a natural phenomenon, but two phenom\ue02d\nena in particular are unwanted since they will \nlead to an unstable or unvegetated and therefore \npotentially erosive situation:\nregression from a low salt marsh (with sedi\ue02d\nment stabilizing Puccinellia) to a pioneer zone \n(with Salicornia).\nregression from a pioneer zone to a bare \nflat.\nFor the salt marshes of The Netherlands, theo\ue02d\nretical lower limits for the height of the marsh \n(relative to Dutch Ordnance Level) have been \ndefined (e.g. van Duin et al., 1997). These can be \n1.\n2.\nviewed as a Type 2a limit: their endogenic natural \nlimits. Due to sea level rise and soil subsidence, \nthe relative height may decrease and unwanted \nregression may occur. The zonal hypothesis states \nthat a change in vegetation type will occur due \nto relative sea level rise when the sedimentation \nrate lags behind. Oost et al. (1998) stated that \nthere are no changes in vegetation type when \nthe sediment balance deficit is temporary and \nsmaller than 5 cm. Recent findings showed that \nin some cases a sediment deficit of as much as \n15 cm had no consequences for the vegetation \n(Dijkema et al., 2005b). The sediment balance \ndeficit for which the salt marsh is still able to exist \ncan be considered as a Type 2b limit: the exogenic \nnatural limit. Research into soil subsidence due \nto gas extraction on the salt marshes of Ameland \nhas shown that not only the sediment balance, but \nalso the drainage and the grazing management \nhave a profound effect on the vegetation zoning. \nThis makes the definition of generic natural limits \nmore complicated.\nFinally, limits have been set for the percentage \nand maximum size of ponds within saltmarsh sys\ue02d\ntems by Van Duin et al. (2003): the total surface \narea of ponds may not exceed 10% and the size \nmay not exceed 50 x 25 m, or have a maximum \nwind fetch of 80 m length. These limits have been \nbased on analysis of natural salt marsh systems \nand are examples of Type 2a limits. A summary \nof natural limits for salt marshes is presented in \nTable 1.\n2.2 Intertidal sand flats and mudflats \n(habitat 1140)\nNatural limits for H1140 can theoretically be de\ue02d\nfined for its quantity and for its quality, similar to \nsaltmarshes. Cleveringa and Oost (1999) studied \nfractal patterns in the tidal basins of the Wad\ue02d\nden Sea and defined a minimum tidal volume for \nsustainable existence of a tidal basin at 55 million \nm3. This is a Type 2a natural limit. \nParameter Limit.

The rate at which sedimentation can keep \nup with the rate of SLR is a Type 2b natural limit \nand is estimated at 5 to 6 mm/year for the Dutch \neastern Wadden Sea. \nThe quality of H1140 is dependent on many \nabiotic and biotic factors. Natural limits for the \nquality of H1140 are, therefore, hard to define. \nMoreover, the natural dynamics in quality pa\ue02d\nrameters such as species abundance, presence \nof biogenic species or sediment composition are \nvery large. Type 2 natural limits can possibly be \ndefined on the basis of an ecosystem approach \nin which the ecological functioning of food webs \nand nutrient cycling form a basis. A conclusive \nsystem, however, has not been developed yet. \nTherefore, only Type 1 natural limits, based mainly \non quantity, can be used at this moment.\n2.3 Intertidal mussel beds (quality \ncriterion for H1140)\nAn intertidal mussel bed is defined as: \u201ca benthic \ncommunity in which mussels (Mytilus edulis) are \ndominant (>5% cover) and in which a spatially \nwell\ue02ddefined structure of large and small groups \nof mussels exists, rising above the surrounding \nsediment and separated by open spaces\u201d (Brink\ue02d\nman et al., 2003). This definition can be seen as a \nType 2a natural limit. Compared to salt marshes, \nthe dynamics in structure and shape of mussel \nbeds are highly variable. \nMussel beds exist of mixed age classes that \noriginate from years with successful recruitment. \nThe size and structure of beds are continuously \nchanging due to growth and loss of mussels. The \nmaximum age of mussel beds can range over \n10 years (Goudswaard et al., 2006), however, \napproximately 50% of the area of mussel beds \ndoes not become older than 1 year and another \n25% does not become older than 2 years (Fey et \nal., 2008). Older banks show a vertical profile of \ndead shells, mixed with faeces and pseudofaeces, \nsand and organic detritus underneath and about \n40% live shells on top (Fey et al., 2008; Dankers \net al., 2004). \nThe stability of mussel beds is determined \nby many factors, such as the age of the bed, \nthe shell\ue02ddensity, the adherence of the byssus\ue02d\nthreads, the bed structure, the height of the bed \nand the stability of the sediment underneath the \nbed. For the (long\ue02dterm) survival of mussel beds, \nmany more factors come into play, such as: bio\ue02d\nlogical factors (spatfall, recruitment, predation), \nabiotic factors (inundation period, temperature, \nsalinity, dissolved oxygen, flow velocity, wave \nexposition, position of the gullies, predominant \nwind direction). The long list makes it clear that \nType 2b natural limits are based on multivariate \nfactors and are hard to define.\n2.4 Food availability for bird \npopulations\nThe quantity of food necessary to support a \npopulation of birds can be seen as a natural limit. \nSuch a limit depends upon species, time (period \nof wintering, moulding, breeding, etc.) and space \n(roosting areas, food availability nearby, etc.). Fur-\nthermore, intraspecific competition plays a role. \nAt the same time shellfish fishermen harvest \nmussels and cockles, an important food source for \nthe birds. A major question is: how many shell\ue02d\nfish can be harvested annually without creating \nfood limitation for birds. Calculating the natural \nlimits and setting user limits helps to prevent \nstarvation of birds due to exploitation of their \nfood sources.\nThere are several models that predict the \nnecessary quantity of food for birds (Brinkman \net al., 2007). The generalized functional response \ndescribes the intake rate of food as a function \nof the density of prey and of competition. Under \nthe assumption of ideal free (Fretwell and Lucas \nJr., 1970; Sutherland, 1996) behaviour, this leads \nto predictions on the distribution of birds in their \nforaging area, the so called aggregative numeri-\ncal response (Van der Meer and Ens, 1997). An \nimportant difference must be made between the \nphysiological and the ecological need for food. \nThe ecological need is determined by the amount \nof food that is physiologically needed and that is \navailable for foraging. \nAs an example we take the oystercatcher \n(Haematopus ostralegus), which mainly feeds \non bivalves. For oystercatchers, Rappoldt et al. \n(2003) found that 3.1 times more food needs to \nbe present in the Wadden Sea than is required for \nphysiological purposes.  Wintering oystercatchers \nneed 360 g/day flesh weight of bivalves, a Type 2a \nnatural limit. To support a population of 216,000 \nbirds over a period of 250 days/year (the conserva\ue02d\ntion objective for the Dutch Wadden Sea, a Type 1 \nlimit), a minimum quantity of 0.36 kg/day x 250 \ndays x 216,000 birds x 3.1 (ecological need factor) \n= 60 million kg flesh weight is needed in total.\nBy monitoring the annual occurrence of mus\ue02d\nsel beds and cockles and the number of oyster\ue02d\ncatchers, both needed and available amount of \nbivalves can be calculated. If the needed amount \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     197 \nWadden Sea Ecosystem No. 26 \ue02d 2010\nImpacts of Human Activities\nis exceeded, shellfish fisheries can be allowed, \nand from the natural limit calculated above, a \nuser limit can be set and harvested. In principle, \nsuch simple natural limits can be derived for more \nspecies of shorebirds, however, for many species \nknowledge is lacking, especially when they feed \non a multitude of prey species. \n3. Juridical assessment\nThe Natura 2000 regime requires that conserva\ue02d\ntion targets are set for all sites designated under \nthe European nature protection directives. The \ntargets for a site particularly relate to safeguard\ue02d\ning favourable conservation status for species and \nhabitat types for which the site received its Euro\ue02d\npean status. The implementation legislation of the \nMember State must ensure that human activities \nwill only be authorised if, on the basis of an assess\ue02d\nment, it is concluded that such activities will not \nfrustrate the conservation targets of the relevant \nsite. In case of uncertainties (\u2018reasonable doubts\u2019), \na plan or project may not be authorised.\nThe development of natural limits fits very \nwell in this system. Particularly if the natural \nlimits are related to the ecological characteris\ue02d\ntics and qualities that constituted the reason for \ndesignating the site, such limits can underpin the \nimplementation of the legal regime. In fact, the \nnatural limits constitute the ecological basis for \nmonitoring ongoing activities and for assessing \nplans and projects that may affect the site.\nA next step \ue02d setting user limits for human \nactivities on the basis of natural limits \ue02d is to \navoid unnecessary assessments, procedures and \nrelated costs; however, we conclude that such \nan approach will almost certainly raise conflicts \nwith the legal requirements. Tailor work (concrete \nassessments of each plan and project) is required \ndue to various factors, such as the complexity of \necological systems, the requirement to take into \naccount cumulative impacts when assessing the \neffects of a plan or project, and the required ap\ue02d\nplication of the precautionary principle (absence \nof reasonable doubts). Nonetheless, as stressed \nabove, the natural limits may substantially sup\ue02d\nport such individual assessments and may to a \ncertain extent limit costs because assessments \ncan be based on the already available knowledge \nregarding natural limits. To have these advan\ue02d\ntages over a longer period of time, monitoring \nand continuous research efforts to increase best \navailable knowledge regarding the natural limits \nare crucial.  \n4. Implementation of natural \nand user limits\nWe defined two main types of natural limits \nand deduced a third type, that of \u2018user limits\u2019. To \nimprove the practical use, we propose the follow\ue02d\ning set of definitions:\nThe natural limit is determined by the value(s) \nfor (a) characteristic (environmental) variable(s) at \nwhich level a pre\ue02ddefined ecosystem component \nor feature complies with its definition. Exceeding \nthe natural limit leads to a significant effect upon \nthe ecosystem component. \nThe user limit is determined by the agreed \nvalue(s) for an activity at which level the char\ue02d\nacteristic (environmental) variables are not sig\ue02d\nnificantly affected. Exceeding the user limit may \nlead to a significant effect upon the ecosystem \ncomponent. \nWe propose the following steps when imple\ue02d\nmenting a system of natural and user limits:\n1. Define and quantify the ecosystem component \nand its qualifying variables (its endogenic \nnatural limits).\n2. Define the limits of the processes and (a)biotic \ncharacteristics of environmental variables that \nserve as boundary conditions (the exogenic \nnatural limits).\n3. Define the limits of external human factors \nthat influence the ecosystem component and \nmay force it beyond its definition (the ultimate \nuser limits). \n4. Define the politically agreed limits for human \nactivities in space and time. \nUser limits can be made flexible in both time and \nspace. The combination of changing environ\ue02d\nmental and human conditions and flexible \nuser limits can only be managed by a form \nof adaptive management and monitoring. We \ntherefore propose as subsequent steps:\n5. Define monitoring parameters both for ecosys\ue02d\ntem parameters and human uses.\n6. Define flexible user limits by comparing moni\ue02d\ntored system parameters with natural limits, \nincluding natural system dynamics. \n5. Conclusions\nWe conclude that a generic set of natural limits, \nvalid for the entire Wadden Sea and for every ac\ue02d\ntivity is not feasible. There are too many intricate \nand unknown inter\ue02drelationships to reach this goal. \nHowever, site\ue02d and species\ue02dspecific limits can be \ndefined to enable appropriate assessments for new \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n198        \nWadden Sea Ecosystem No. 26 \ue02d 2010\nImpacts of Human Activites\nactivities in the Natura 2000 regime. Furthermore, \nwe conclude that knowledge of resilience and \nuncertainty needs to increase in order to define \nnatural limits and \u2018significant effects\u2019 of activities. \nWe finally recommend application of appropri\ue02d\nate monitoring and adaptive management tools \nin a framework of flexible user limits to support \na sustainable balance between human use and \nnature.\nReferences\nBeeftink, W.G., 1984.

Ethical Issues in Contemporary Economic Schools as a Consequence of Changes in the Concept of Human Nature\uf02a Abstract The last financial crisis combined with some recent social trends (like growing in-equality or environmental problems) inspired many contemporary economists to the re-evaluation of actual economic knowledge in the search for solutions to these problems. Modern economic schools (especially heterodox ones) stress the meaning of ethical issues in economics more often. The thesis of the paper is that this revival of the ethical face of present economics depends very strongly on the changing as-sumptions of human nature within economics and other disciplines which work alongside economics, such as social psychology or business ethics, for instance. In order to prove the thesis, the paper provides an evaluation of current economic schools, especially within the heterodoxy, in search of their ethical aspects, and pre-sents them as a result of the changing assumptions about human beings within those schools. This ethical dimension of human beings manifests itself in different ways, which can be perceived as a result of it being based on different ethical schools and different psychological and philosophical assumptions about human nature.

Introduction During the last few decades our economy and society have encountered various economic and social crises and problems, which have provoked lively debates by economists. Contemporary economists feel prompted by the situation to re-evaluate contemporary economic knowledge in order to find solutions to the current prob-lems. Heterodox economists tend to blame orthodox economics for having failed to provide explanations and answers to present problems. The reason for the failure is seen in the concept of human nature, which provides the foundations upon which mainstream economics are built. However, this concept is criticized for various rea-sons, which are discussed elsewhere.1 This paper focuses mainly on the ethical as-pects, which are missing in the neoclassical concept. It is possible to regain the eth-ical face of economics if the economists acknowledge that the ethical dimension of human beings exists.2 The first platform to discover the ethical nature of the hu-man being can be found in the diverse modern approaches to economic ethics, which combine two views of the economic actor \u2013 the economic and the ethical. Some of those approaches are further developed by economists (like the \u2018Capability approach\u2019 of Amartya Sen, \u2018integrative ethics\u2019 by Peter Ulrich, \u2018Governance ethics\u2019 by Josef Wieland, or \u2018economic ethics\u2019 by Karl Homan), and others by philosophers (ethicians) \u2013 like discourse ethics by J\u00fcrgen Habermas, or communitarianism, by Amitai Etzioni. This has diverse consequences on how economics is perceived, sometimes giving supremacy to ethics, sometimes to economics, while at other times it looks to combine both.3 The other platform where we can observe the rebirth of the ethical face of economics is in heterodox economics. Diverse schools in heterodox economics incorporate ethical aspects into their understanding of hu-man beings, and therefore economics. Ethical reasoning also takes various forms \u2013                                                            1  A.

ETHICAL ISSUES\u2026 57 tending more towards utilitarianism, common for neoclassical economic thinking, or towards some more deontological approaches going beyond individual or even beyond utilitarian reasoning.  Therefore, in the first section, the paper reviews contemporary ethical schools which deal with economic problems, and count to economic ethics approaches, fo-cusing on the effects of their understanding of human nature on the understanding of the challenges of economics? In the second section, current trends in economic heterodox schools are discussed, referring to their concept of human nature. Does it have some ethical aspects and how they are reflected by economics? What are those ethical aspects? What kind of ethical reasoning is used there?  2. The changing face of economics: current developments in mod-ern approaches to economic ethics  Modern economic ethics schools started to develop in the 1980s as philosophers, politicians, sociologist and society in general started to highlight the limits of pure economic thinking in solving the contemporary problems. Those problems are pri-marily concerned with ecology (the emergence of the Club of Rome marked a sig-nificant point on the timeline), but also with growing inequality, starvation, corrup-tion, economic and financial crises and health. The issues discussed by the expan-sive nature of economic thinking was extremely broad, covering even private spheres of living like marriage, the family or religion.4 During last decades the trend started to reverse and the ethical reasoning came back to the economics. \u2018Coming back\u2019 refers to the fact, that originally ethics was a fundamental part of the econom-ics (like for Aristotle or Adam Smith). Economic ethics (developed by Karl Homan5) was one of first responses to the lack of ethical frames for economics. However, it hasn\u2019t adapted ethical concept of human nature, sticking to the egoistic, utility-maximizing model of man. But such behavior can have negative effects on other people or on nature (these negative effects are called due to Arthur Pigou \u2018external effects\u2019) and diminish the utility of these other persons. Basing on the idea of utilitarianism developed by Jeremy Ben-tham, John Stuart Mill,6 Karl Homan considers such behavior as unethical. There-fore, the maximizing behavior has to be woven into the network of state regula-tions, so that the choice of moral good for the individual remains profitable (for instance: through taxes, regulations, controls). The ethical face of economics is therefore reduced only to the regulative framework put on the market. In other words \u2013 economics requires political embedding, which it ethical once again.                                                             4 See: G.S.

Mill, The utilitarians, Anchor Press, Garden City, NY 1973. 58 ANNA HORODECKA Governance ethics (developed by Josef Wieland7) focuses primarily on the moral dimension (Tm) of individual business transactions. This is a function of individual self-control mechanisms (IS) with their background in the principles of virtue and other mechanisms,8 both formal (FI) and informal institutions (IF) of the institutional environment (which as well has moral components) and the nature of coordination and cooperation mechanisms of the economic organization (OCC) de-pending on a specific transaction (i), and specific place (j):  Tmi = \ud835\udc53 (aISi, bFIij, cIFij, dOCCi). Attention is also drawn here to the fact that, in order to reduce the high trans-action costs discussed in agency theory (the principal-agent problem9), managers should strive for some \u2018governance\u2019 rules, and the ethical education of the work-force. An excellent tool is a well-designed and properly supervised \u2018code of ethics\u2019, emphasizing, among others, the need for the formation of human character as well as values management.10 The code is also an agreement regarding the creation of an immanent model of man within the organization \u2013 the model of an ideal employee. Morality is here treated as an individual and a collective resource that must be acti-vated by a special management system, i.e. individual commitments, supervision of formal and informal institutions or a mechanism for cooperation and coordination in the organization. The rules of \u2018governance\u2019, useful for activation, can be divided according to two criteria: formal/informal and private/public.11 The human being is considered to be motivated by his social surroundings and therefore some ethical conformism (a conventional stage in the development of a person) may be a good starting point for further moral education. Because the standards and values of the organization should be common and should meet the needs of the community, the process of their assimilation takes place within the organization. The relationship to nature and ecological aspects might not be discussed separately, depending on the values of the particular community.12 Summing up, Governance Ethics widens the scope of ethical discourse (for instance the responsibility of actions) not limiting it only to the state level, but distinguishing many levels of responsibility: individual, that of the organization (coordination, cooperation mechanisms), of society and its culture (informal), and of the state and global society.13 The union of all those levels contributes to the moral dimension of economic transactions. The individual is co-responsible for his/her action and, in a further sense, is the co-creator of the culture.                                                           7 Developed by J.

He maintains that the law, its enforcement and moral standards of behavior constitute basic requirements for efficient economic activities. Idem, Governance ethics\u2026, p. 61.  THE CHANGING FACE OF ECONOMICS? ETHICAL ISSUES\u2026 59 Integrative ethics (developed by Peter Ulrich and his St. Gallen Institute) main-tains that the moral character of the individual and his social actions are based both on economic logic and ethical substantive reasoning, which should be shaped in a new way \u2013 oriented for the future and serving life (German: Lebensdienlichkeit).14 The life-serv-ing principle is considered superior to the logic of the market, which used alone is in-consistent, lacks an ethical sense and cannot cope with the contemporary problems of the economy, which cannot be limited only to the issue of efficiency. These problems include diverse social conflicts (both values and interests) for the division of internal and external costs and benefits of the process of rationalization.15 Therefore, the conflict be-tween economic rationality and ethical reasoning should be resolved through so called socio-economic rationality, which includes ethical point of view.16 At the individual level, it is assumed that a person is able to subordinate his activities and behavior to the norms and values of the group, whereby the guiding principle is the recognition of others as units with the same dignity.17 Morality is therefore understood as a freedom under the recognition of inter-subjectivity,18 which is rooted in the social structure, based on the acknowledging of the symmetry of interpersonal relationships (\u2018interhumanity\u2019 translated from the German original: Zwischenmenschlichkeit19). Individual motives are therefore subordinated to the principle of the convertibility of inter-subjective perspec-tives. The social level of the concept of human nature is based on the principle of the total equality of people (which translates into the principle of symmetry) and their mu-tual dependence. The relationship to nature is marked by the attitude of responsible economic actions which respect the future generations.  Communitarianism (developed by Amitai Etzioni)20 is based on the idea that val-ues and norms are dependent on the culture. It is critical of the idea of the absolute freedom of the individual choosing values without regarding their social value. Com-munitarianism gives priority to social and political communities and requires that moral values should take into account the interests of the community. The individual\u2019s devel-opment has to be compatible with the accordance of the values of the society, which can be quickened by means of education, business leadership, consensus, the pressure of groups and social role models. The value of the community in which the person is lo-cated is given a greater priority over the choice of the individual. At the social level, the concept of human nature is based on the idea of the dependence and subordination of the individual to society, which allows for self-realization. Individual success is per-                                                          14 See: P.

The relationship to nature depends on the values and norms of that community. The \u2018capability approach\u2019 developed by Amartya Sen,21 and later by Martha Nussbaum,22 focuses on the interpersonal differences between people and their diverse possibilities (capabilities) to meet their needs.23 However it assumes that all persons, regardless of those differences, have the right to wellbeing. It focuses on solving the most important global problems, like social inequality and poverty. The capability ap-proach introduces a very important differentiation between \u2018functionings\u2019, referring to all desirable \u2018doings\u2019 and \u2018beings\u2019, and \u2018capabilities\u2019. Acquiring wellbeing depends on so-called \u2018converting factors\u2019, which transform our resources into factual functionings. These converting factors can be divided into individual (health, gender), social (social constraints and facilities) and environmental (physical environment, climate). Whereas standard economics focuses on resources and their distribution, the capability approach maintains that, due to diverse conversion factors, we need different amounts of resources to meet our needs and so we need to focus on ends \u2013 functionings and capabilities. In-come (a resource) is only one of the ways to acquire wellbeing, but it is not the only one \u2013 we also have to integrate into our analysis \u2018converting factors\u2019. Such thinking is a result of the concept of human nature, which is based on some universal understanding of human motives: its wellbeing concept is based on some universal capabilities which ensure this wellbeing, which is the source of human motivation (not: the utility). On the social level, the approach assumes that human equality is combined with the uniqueness of each human being. The relationship to nature is derived from the idea of intergener-ational justice, which is a consequence of the belief that each human being, today or tomorrow, has the same right to pursue wellbeing. However, there are some postulates to extend this approach by taking into account the intrinsic value of nature, responsibility (not only ex-post but ex-ante), and by introducing subjectivity at the collective level.24 Discourse ethics25 (developed by Karl-Otto Apel and J\u00fcrgen Habermas) is a theory which does not propose any central norm which can be adapted to solve ethical problems, but it suggests producing those norms in public (everyone can                                                           21 A.

THE CHANGING FACE OF ECONOMICS? ETHICAL ISSUES\u2026 61 participate in it), free of violence (the position of the participant does not matter), and that there be reasonable discourse (only reasonable arguments count). A norm will be adapted which obtains the approval of the participants of the discourse. It means that the truth is to be found not somewhere in the deliberations but it is the logical result of the process of communication and the language abilities of peo-ple.26 The ability to reason and argue allows for the actualization of diverse motives, values and desires of people. These are the norms on which the individual bases his decision, and which permit him to communicate with society and find their approval or disapproval. The reason (mind) allows a person for seeing the consequences of those norms. The relationship to nature in this concept of human beings depends on the current moral, ecological and technical level of society. If the society is com-mitted to some moral norms (like intergenerational justice for instance), and has well-functioning political institutions, appropriate technology and knowledge about possible consequences of natural resource usage and pollution for future genera-tions, is more likely to prevent ecological catastrophes and care for the natural en-vironment. The rules concerning the environment depend more on whether or not this problem will be noticed by the public and if everyone will be able to accept the consequences of such standards \u2013 like sustainability. A pure capitalistic society, where the capital-owner attempt to maximize the gain, hamper such a discourse. More appropriate would be a post-capitalist society, which gives to the community some control over the production and doesn\u2019t leave all the power to capital-owner who look for ways of limiting costs of the production on the costs of the society.  3. Ethical aspects of contemporary heterodox economic schools as a result of ethical perceptions of human nature First of all, when speaking of ethical aspects, we have to define what we consider to be ethical aspects. Ethics generally focuses on problems which we deal with through rational reasoning,27 aiming to decide what action or solution is \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019. Neoclassical economics replaces this \u2018good-bad\u2019 criterion with \u2018efficient-not efficient\u2019 and calls efficient choices \u2018rational\u2019. Thus, whereas economics refers to rationality only in categories of \u2018means\u2019, ethics focuses on the final aspects of deci-sions, asking whether they are \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019. Ethically oriented economics would, in this sense, be based on \u2018wise\u2019 actions (based on principles resulting from a con-viction that there is some \u2018good\u2019) in comparison to \u2018clever\u2019 ones (oriented on their utility)28 and integrating \u2018reasonable\u2019 actions as well (based on the calculation of the consequences of actions). Heterodox economics intends to bring back to eco-nomics this moral perspective and the question about \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019. It therefore                                                           26 J. Habermas, Philosophische Anthropologie, [in:] Kultur und Kritik, ed. J. Habermas, Suhrkamp, Frankfurt 1973.  27 This may include considering many alternatives, which not necessarily are profitable for the individ-ual. 28 J. Stacewicz, Etyczne przes\u0142anki dzia\u0142ania gospodarczego, \u201cProblemy\u201d 1988, No. 4, pp. 1\u20135. 62 ANNA HORODECKA has a normative character, but it maintains that neoclassical economics is also a nor-mative one \u2013 as long as it uses \u2018efficient\u2019 normatively as another way of saying \u2018good\u2019, and \u2018not efficient\u2019 is treated as \u2018bad\u2019. In this sense we are always normative, even when we contradict this. A vivid example of the return of moral language in economics is the book The economics of Good and Evil (by Tomas Sedl\u00e1\u010dek29), which became a bestseller, which is proof of the demand for such \u2018an ethical face of economics\u2019.30  Ethics, by definition, refers both to the character of the person and morality. The ethical aspects in human nature comprise the virtuous character of the person \u2013 his norms and values \u2013 which goes beyond self-interest, allowing for the integrity of his behavior. Thus, speaking of the ethical aspects of current heterodox economic thought, the following questions have to be of importance (which translates into a very holistic and interdisciplinary field of economics31): (1) Does economics refer in its discourse to categories of \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019?  (2) Does economics refer to some general norms or values which have to be respected in order to decide if something is \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 (not limited just to \u2018efficiency\u2019 or \u2018utility\u2019) (3) Does economics refer only to the \u2018individual\u2019 (oriented only on self) di-mension of human nature, or considers as well a \u2018social\u2019 dimension (re-ferring to the relations of the individual to other people) and \u2018world\u2019 di-mension (relating to the attitude to the nature)?32 Such issues necessarily open the perspective to common interests, values and norms, people con-sider the broader horizon of the consequences of individual actions  (4) Does economics, in its description of the human being, make some refer-ence to his character, virtue, ability to choose between \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 on the basis of moral reasoning, which comprises more than just the utility,33                                                           29 T.

THE CHANGING FACE OF ECONOMICS? ETHICAL ISSUES\u2026 63 (5) Does economics refer to some \u2018common good\u2019,34 which allows the indi-vidual to transcend his particular interests? Does this common good con-tain only material components, or non-material as well?35 Social capital,36 for instance, considers such immaterial aspects of social relations which subsequently have material outcomes.37 For solving problems in the economy, we need some concepts which would help us to combine those perspectives and adjust the ethical language to economic problems and challenges. It's about developing an ethical look at economic prob-lems, because they happen to be important not only for the individual, but they also have social and global dimensions. Without considering it, we risk encountering problems which hurt both our convictions and material interests. Neoclassical economics doesn\u2019t allow for such ethical language, reducing hu-man being to the \u2018basement\u2019 (to one individual dimension and lowest level of the concept of human nature \u2013 the \u2018body\u2019-level)38, treating him as a machine, maxim-izing his utility, freeing him from the bonds of society and its norms, and nature, picturing him as \u2018a crude caricature\u2019 when it comes to dealing with the emergent dynamics of collective phenomena. Geoffrey M. Hodgson exposes the deficiencies                                                           34 Wieland stresses the fact that the economics as meant by Adam Smith was the wealth of nations and not the wealth of shareholders. 35 If the \u2018common good\u2019 is only a material one, there won\u2019t be other enforcing mechanisms for ethical choices as the material effect of actions. Therefore, in case of two values, one ethical like justice and one materialistic, one would choose the materialistic violating ethical once. However the effects of violated norms and values like those mentioned above, for instance, can have grave consequences (material and non-material) for society, see: D. Collins, op. cit., and impede the cooperative behavior as well.  36 See: N. Lin, Social Capital: A Theory of Social Structure and Action (Structural Analysis in the Social Sciences), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, May 2002. Social capital refers to the institutions, relationships, and norms that shape the quality and quantity of a society's social interactions. Increasing evidence shows that social cohesion is critical for societies to prosper economically and for the development to be sustainable. Social capital is not just the sum of the institutions which underpin a society \u2013 it is the glue that holds them together (http://go.worldbank.org/K4LUMW43B0). There are a number of key sources of social capital (SC) in the context of social and economic development: (1) families (first building block); (2) communities (social interactions among neighbors, friends and groups, which generate social capital and the ability to work together for a common good); (3) firms (building and sustaining firms demands trust and a common sense of purpose, i.e., social capital, which reduces transactions costs); (4) civil society (SC is crucial to the non-governmental organization by providing opportunities for participation and by giving voice to those who don\u2019t have any access to formal ways of affecting change); (5) public sector (the state and its institutions is central to the functioning and welfare of any society); (6) ethinicity (ethnic relations like immigration, microenterprise development, tribal nepotism or racial conflict, show how actors sharing common values and culture can band together for mutual benefit), (7) gender (Social networks as a source of income), see: http://go.worldbank.org/XR8TFW7L20.  37 If somebody keeps his word regardless if it pays off or not, and this rule is enforced by society, it makes the transactions more reliable and the probability that we will enter into them is greater, or at least the costs of1 making such transactions are reduced (transaction costs). 38  B.

This school attempts to discover rules of behavior which allow predictions of economic phenomena to be made. It is not assumed a priori what a human being is, what motives people have, what are their aims.41 The observation delivers results which contradict the utilitarian, egoistic, rational nature of human beings, showing emotional elements.42 Does behavioral economics make any space for ethical con-sideration? Yes, in the sense that, through such observations and experiments, it comes to the conclusion that there are some unwritten rules of cooperation and social interchange, which contradict the idea of maximizing behavior. It finds empirical ev-idence for some tendencies in behavior which we would describe with ethical lan-guage as oriented towards some norms and values. So the observed reciprocity43 in-dicates the belief in fairness, and the emphasis on behavior oriented towards satisfac-tion and not optimization speaks for the superiority of needs over preferences.  Feminist economics44 deals with a range of phenomena. The kind of phenomenon depends on the principle of whether it has to do with some practical problems of society and not abstract ones like in neoclassical economics. Therefore, what counts most are the real needs of society, the cultural context, and gender problems. The analyzed phe-nomena are considered by assuming that justice, equal rights and real needs matter. Tak-ing a closer look at the gendered speech and attitudes to the science, feminist economics criticized the fact that many solutions to given problems are based on power relations (discussed earlier by critical theory45). This is a consequence of the assumed concept of human nature which, at the individual level, considers the socially made differences                                                           39 Peter Corning (Institute for the Study of Complex Systems and the author of The Fair Society) about: G.M.

It means, for once, that when we do not look for norms and values, they cannot be revealed by themselves. We still make some assumptions about the world we perceive. Behavioral economics reduces such assumptions to those which are used in the objective sciences\u201a like economics or psychology. 42See: C.F. Camerer, G.

THE CHANGING FACE OF ECONOMICS? ETHICAL ISSUES\u2026 65 between men and women as resulting in different values and ways of behaving, and maintains that both are equally important. At the social level, feminist economics refers to social justice, by discussing the problem of the power-related hierarchy of values, which understates the values represented by women, minorities and the disabled. The relationship to nature plays an important role at the individual and social level of the human being. To a great extent in feminist economics, ecological problems are of im-portance.46 Solving ecological problems requires people to take care of society and have some moral standards, and economics has to reflect this.47 The assumption of a cultur-ally differentiated concept of the human results in a descriptive and normative attitude to researching problems. Feminist economists \u2018dig into the particulars of the situation and join in dialog with a proper attitude of modesty, rather than pretend to preach from an imaginary value-free and perfectly rigorous platform located somewhere outside our ecological world and our diverse society.\u201948 The basic question is: \u2018How do we want to live, in the light of the effects of our life choices on other people and living beings, now and in the future?\u2019 It can be considered an ethical question, as long as it assumes the existence of some common interests of humanity.  Evolutionary economics49 assumes that the human being is a satisfier and not an optimizer. His behavior is motivated by \u2018adjusting to the environment\u2019, which includes both egoistic and altruistic behavior. This includes processes of learning, which are com-bined with obtaining and passing knowledge to/from others by means of education, pro-duction, work and, most of all, within firms. The person is perceived as a holon, he is heterogeneous, interdependent, embedded in the social and natural world, motivated by various needs \u2013 altruistic and egoistic \u2013 and is cooperative and competitive. This trans-lates into the interest of evolutionary economics in analyzing economic problems in a more ethical way, speaking not of economic growth but of development, dealing with human behavior beyond the market, treating the market as an open and autopoietic sys-tem (depending on a real human person respecting their values), institutional and eco-nomic change and, most of all, by exploring the problem of knowledge as a central force in the development of the economy, also including ethical aspects.50 Ecological economics51 looks to solve problems by acknowledging the depend-ence of economic systems on social end ecological ones. This situates the human, with his needs and wants, in a broader context. The social embedding of the human being                                                           46 Feminist economists concerned about ecological problematic build part of the feminist economic school, which is referred as feminist ecological economics. 47 J.A.

This brings us to some transindiviudal norms and values which humanity has to respect, like intergenerational justice and respect for other lifestyles.52 The humanistic economic53 approach is, per definition, an ethical one, because it is based on the assumption that the person is pursuing his self-development, which refers not only to inner qualities like character and virtues, but it considers norms and values as immanent to all deeds of a person and society. It also assumes that only reasoning should take the central role in solving problems. The analysis of economic problems refers to some objective norms and rules, for instance justice and human dignity, which are protected by human rights. The same concerns the attitude of economic thought as developed within some world religions (like Buddhism, Islam and Christian-Catholic teaching). These \u2018religious\u2019 schools of economics can be considered as a part of human-istic economics, which perceives human actions in the light of some transindividual val-ues. World religions pay much attention to the problems of ecological devastation, which is a consequence of the assumption that the world belongs to God and was left to humans only for custody,54 or is, in fact, God himself.55 The assumption by humanist economics and religious motivated economic schools that a person aims to reach highest level of self-realization \u2013 transcendence \u2013 means eventually being free of self-focus, self-relating, self-interest and orientation on some general principles, interests and needs. This opens up many possibilities for ethical discourse. 4. Conclusion The changes in the way we speak and think about human nature contribute to the growing criticisms about contemporary problems in the economy and economics, and interests in economic ethics. The consequence of this interest translates into the emer-gence of various economic ethical schools which focus on those mentioned problems and look for their solution. The chance of solving those problems is perceived in let-ting in ethical reasoning into economics by, for instance, taking greater control and, at the local, state and global level of economics, developing social capital, strength-ening the diverse social institutions, especially those which enforce the moral behav-iour in society. Table 1 delivers an overview of the discussed modern heterodox economic schools regarding their attitude to human nature at the individual and supra-individual level (social and global). Concluding, we can say that the human being is viewed in                                                           52 Ecological economics includes in its analysis the intrinsic value of nature. 53 M.A.X.

ETHICAL ISSUES\u2026 67 more dimensions, including social and global ones. For the individual level, the hu-man being is perceived more and more as dependent on society, a particular time cul-ture, and is motivated by both egoistic and altruistic reasons. They make cooperation possible, which lies in the foundations for looking for common norms and values, discussed at the social level (respecting its plurality) and impacting the relationship to nature (growing relevance). Table 1. Ethical aspects of contemporary economic heterodox thought Source: own elaboration. The following table (Table 2) provides some insight into the changes in under-standing the goal and field of particular heterodox economic schools. They reveal the possibilities for the economy to gain an ethical face, as long as they get back to man\u2019s real needs and those of his environment, which would allow a discourse about \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 to take place, as long as we no longer deal with abstract phenomena like the market and efficiency, but deal with real individuals, society  Individual world Social world and worldview Behavioral The emotional and rational nature of human beings (bounded rationality) External (framing) and internal (per-sonality, aversion to risk) factors shape human behavior  The relationship between people based on reciprocity not on maximizing util-ity, therefore ethical behaviors are pre-ferred as long as someone does not harm them (tit for tat) Feminist Pluralistic view on human nature \u2013 feminine and masculine, necessity of integration of their values: rational-emotional, autonomous-dependent, egoistic-altruistic, rational choice \u2013 in-tuitive, preferences \u2013 needs Social / cultural embedding of the in-dividual The superiority of only masculine val-ues contradicts the equality, plurality and complexity of society  Environmental aspects discussed widely in the ecological feminist ap-proach (relationship to nature is com-bined with the social structure) Humanist The dual-self concept (self-interest/so-cial interest, egoistic/altruistic, lower needs (wants)/higher needs, mate-rial/non-material, short/long-life needs), with the assumption that the person tends to choose a higher self (self-realization/transcendence)  The human is in the center of the world, the world is a reflection of him - econ-omy and society shall support human development and allow him to satisfy his needs Society and culture evolve Harmony within society is superior to economic growth Ecological Competition (h. oec.) & cooperation (h. reciprocans & communicus) are possible only by acknowledging some norms; bounded rationality: emotional and rational; wellbeing has material and non-material elements (happiness, the role of internal factors); procedural utility and not possessive one  The world system is a closed one, therefore the economic system has to respect the borders put in place by the social (social-cultural) and ecological system The biophysical foundations of eco-nomics put economics into some real frames again Evolutionary Satisfying and not optimizing behavior, motivated by adjusting to the environ-ment and passing knowledge, is both al-truistic and egoistic The interest of the group is necessary for the survival of the individual: the balance of cooperation and competition Society influences the individuals in their choices 68 ANNA HORODECKA and problems. This means, as the table demonstrates, the reintegration of political, social and ethical issues into economics. Whereas political issues are based on eth-ical language \u2013 rights, values, norms, social \u2013 there is no specific language for such a discourse which is geared toward needs, which are the basis of the development of the human character. Heterodox economics attempts to overcome this difficulty. The goal of economics is now wellbeing, such as accomplishing various and real human needs, both material and non-material ones (rights, values). Table 2.

Consequently, the geographical distribution of mycotoxigenic fungi, such as Aspergillus flavus, will be expanded into more northern and eastern regions of Europe. This could result in significantly higher contamination with aflatoxins and probability of large regions being non-compliant with EU legislative limits for food and feed (Battilani et al., 2016). It is possible that similar impacts could be felt in other important staple food production areas in Asia, North and South America. This will have both food security and economic effects.Thus changes in the environment in which staple crops are grown as well as the predicted global movement of fungal diseases and pests and a change in their diversity are major drivers which will have significant implications for the predominant mycotoxins on a regional basis. Indeed, the impact of CC on mycotoxin contamination of key staple food/feed commodities will also have significant economic consequences, especially in developing countries.In this special issue, topics were included presenting readers with a broad insight into the effects the changing world may have on mycotoxins, on a global scale, but also within specific fields of mycotoxin research. The latter aspects help to understand the role of different scientific disciplines as a whole to ensure, in a sustainable manner, safe and sufficient food and feed supplies.We thus believe that this is a very timely special issue which addresses some of the key research areas with a mixture of review and primary papers. Authors were encouraged to speculate within the boundaries of their expert knowledge on the impacts that such changes might have on mycotoxins. Interdisciplinary approaches were stimulated to emphasise the importance of utilising the whole array of knowledge from molecular pathways for biosynthesis of mycotoxins to minimisation strategies, diagnostic tools to pre- and post-harvest predictive modelling and economic impacts.This special issue of World Mycotoxin Journal includes a number of major themes which cover the breadth of research activities relevant to mycotoxin research, divided over various sections. The implications of changes in environment on shifts in the diversity of mycotoxigenic fungi, the agronomy of crops as drivers of changes in infection of cereals by mycotoxigenic fungi, including impacts at a fundamental molecular/functional level on mycotoxin production and on commodity productivity are considered.The area of predictive modelling has been addressed which provides insights into the state of the art science on the impact of CC and the interaction between environmental factors and mycotoxin production. Will changes in agricultural practice and land use be required? The impacts of organic vs conventional cultivation issues and the benefits and challenges of biocontrol strategies are examined. Other very important issues are the consequences that environmental change might have on the economics and management of mycotoxins and the perceptions and food consumption habits of consumers who want to have residue-free food commodities. Will this require changes in the types of risk and exposure assessments, especially in relation to mixtures of mycotoxins? Furthermore, the large amount of data now becoming available on the so-called modified mycotoxins indicate that traditional analytical methods can underestimate the amount of relevant mycotoxins present in food and feed. These topics are all covered in this special issue. This provides a holistic view from multidisciplinary angles of the state of the art in Foreword: mycotoxins in a changing worldThis special issue arose because of the changes in the global landscape in relation to the impact and implications of our changing climate on food security and quality, consumer habits, trade and economics, regulations and scientific thinking. The EU green paper (EC, 2007) on climate change (CC) has suggested significant hot spots in different regions where food production will be considerably affected both in quality and quantity.

Below we have summarised the key aspects which are covered in this special issue.A key driver of mycotoxin research is the influence that mycotoxins have on economics and trade of major staple commodities especially between LMICs and developed countries. This is a key context for carrying out research which is relevant to the development of minimisation and prevention strategies. Wu and Mitchell (2016) have identified CC as the greatest factor affecting the mycotoxin problem. They have focused on existing and future scenarios of CC and how these will influence fungal infection and production of specific mycotoxins in food crops. The relevant impact of existing maximum allowable mycotoxin limits is discussed. A case study of how maize growers in the USA will be affected is included and the overall conclusions are that aflatoxins are the mycotoxins most likely to increase under future CC scenarios and which will have the greatest economic impact in the future. This is the context in which this special issue should be seen.The 2nd section, Environment, mycotoxins and predictive modelling, contains a series of four papers dealing with the effects that changing environments have at a genomic level, utilisation of these data for predicting production of mycotoxins and then two papers where a specific case of Fusarium graminearum and head blight of wheat is addressed followed by a holistic paper on predicting the production of mycotoxins using geographical and ecological data sets. Gilbert et al. (2016) examined the consequences that CC scenarios may have on growth and toxigenic potential of A. flavus. The application of functional genomics, including genomic sequencing, RNA-seq, microarray technologies and proteomics have revealed CC-related effects on the aflatoxin cluster and plant-fungus interactions. Furthermore, elevated CO2 levels have been shown to impact on expression of the aflatoxin biosynthetic regulatory gene aflR. The use of functional genomics will allow researchers to better understand the underlying transcriptomic response within the fungus to CC, with a view towards predicting changes in fungal infection and toxin production under such changed environmental conditions. Magan and Medina (2016) have used microarrays to examine the relationship between interacting CC conditions on growth and toxin gene cluster expression. The relationship of these to phenotypic toxin production suggests that the effect on mycotoxin production is commonly much more significant as compared to the effect on growth. Modelling application to these data sets is suggested as a powerful tool for predicting the relative toxin production under extreme stress conditions, including CC scenarios. Different mycotoxigenic fungi may respond differently to CC conditions and thus extrapolation should be avoided or done with care. Vaughan et al. (2016) examined the effect of changes mediated by future environments, especially climatically, on the evolutionary ecology of the F. graminearum species complex and future Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) epidemic patterns. A multitude of factors and key processes should be taken into account in order to anticipate the magnitude and direction of the change in FHB and mycotoxin risk, which may be challenging for quantitative assessments due to gaps in knowledge. It is suggested that simulation modelling approaches will be very helpful. Further research is needed to understand the combined influence of multiple abiotic factors on host defences, and the mechanisms by which individual and combined factors modulate wheat defences during Fusarium infection to optimise breeding efforts and climate resilient management strategies. Zhang et al. (2016) observed that both the Fusarium fujikuroi species complex (FFSC) and the F. graminearum species complex are the causal agents of Fusarium ear rot in the maize producing areas in China. Fumonisin B1-producing Fusarium verticillioides was the most prevalent species, followed by fumonisin B1-producing Fusarium proliferatum and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol-producing F. graminearum. Both Fusarium temperatum and Fusarium boothii were identified for the first time in cooler regions in China. Mating type analysis and virulence tests showed adaptation to the host. The authors concluded that wheat/maize rotation selects for F. graminearum, while a wheat/rice rotation selects for Fusarium asiaticum. In contrast, F. boothii is selected when maize is cultivated without rotation. This shows that a change of crop \u2013 due to climate change, change in consumer preference or other economic reasons \u2013 can lead to a change in prevalent fungal species and type of mycotoxin produced. It might also lower the infection pressure of the replaced fungal species to other susceptible crops in that area. Van der Fels-Klerx et al. (2016) reviewed the available data of CC impacts on mycotoxin contamination in the field using a modelling approach. Only three examples have been published with a focus on Fusarium in wheat, A. flavus in maize and wheat and Alternaria in tomato. These have all been focused on Europe. The two main research gaps were identified regarding existing models. There has been very limited focus on some selected mycotoxin-crop combinations. Their validation has only been completed in one/few countries due to the (limited) availability and accessibility of data. Overall, the modelling approach shows some promise and should be integrated with models for other combinations of mycotoxins-crops to be able to better assist in mycotoxin management during crop cultivation in Europe, and to mitigate the expected CC impacts on mycotoxins.With the rapid advances in the development of mycotoxin analytical systems there has been significant interest in the possible shifts in the occurrence of fungi and mycotoxins and whether biochemical transformations in the plant may be impacted by environmental changes. To this end http://www.wageningenacademic.com/doi/pdf/10.3920/WMJ2016.x004 - Tuesday, January 03, 2017 7:18:10 AM - IP Address:138.250.27.148  ForewordWorld Mycotoxin Journal 9 (5) 649two papers is the 3rd section have addressed the area of Shifts in occurrence of mycotoxins, with a focus on masked mycotoxins. Dall\u2019Asta and Battilani (2016) showed that recently an increasing number of studies on masked/modified mycotoxins have been published. They have focused on fumonisins where knowledge of modified forms is still in its infancy because of the wide range of interactions the toxins may have with the matrix, and of the complexity of the F. verticillioides-Zea mays pathosystem. Extreme events, mentioned in CC scenarios may modify the dominant mycotoxigenic fungi and influence both mycotoxin production and their modification. The authors propose that modified fumonisins should be included in the monitoring plans to get an overview of their possible contribution to human exposure. Future research should include events occurring in the field and on the cross-talk between the plant and the fungus, to support the identification of resistant hybrids and to provide data for predictive models, the most suitable tool to forecast what is going to happen in the future changing climate. Lemmens et al. (2016) suggested that not only CC, but also contemporary developments in agriculture, such as breeding for enhanced FHB-resistance may result in changes in patterns of mycotoxins and their masked forms. For example, in new wheat varieties this is visible for deoxynivalenol (DON) and its modified form DON-3-glucoside (DON-3G), where the most resistant lines with the lowest DON contamination show the highest relative level of DON-3G to DON. The authors hypothesise that a relatively higher proportion of DON is converted in planta to DON-3G in lines with an improved FHB resistance. The information provided here comes at a timely moment, since the CONTAM Panel of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is currently in the process of drafting a Scientific Opinion about the risks to human and animal health of DON and its modified forms, including DON-3G.Sustainable agricultural practices and precision systems have resulted in changes in Agricultural practices and land use. This issue, the subject area of the 4th section, has been addressed in papers dealing with organic vs sustainable systems and the practical utilisation of biocontrol agents for aflatoxins in maize/groundnuts. Brodal et al. (2016) reviewed conventional and organic systems and the impact that they have on contamination of different commodities with mycotoxins. Data were from controlled field studies, farm surveys and some food basket surveys. Almost 50% focused on DON in cereals. Other toxins looked at were HT-2/T-2 toxins, zearalenone and patulin. For the Fusarium toxins, levels in organically produced grains were either similar or (slightly) lower than in conventionally produced grains. Many studies suggest that weather condition, year of production, type of crop rotation and tillage practice have a greater impact on DON than whether conventional or organic agricultural practices were applied. For patulin in apples, higher contamination was found in organically than in conventionally produced apple/apple products. This review suggests that more systematic comparisons from scientifically controlled field trials and surveys are necessary to clarify whether differences in the risk of mycotoxin contamination between organically and conventionally produced crops are indeed real. Bandyopadhyay et al. (2016) indicated that contamination with aflatoxins is still a major concern; its occurrence transcends health, food security and trade sectors, affecting all actors in value chains and consumers. Use of biocontrol products with atoxigenic A. flavus active ingredients is a proven method for reducing the aflatoxin content of crops. In the USA, biopesticides based on atoxigenic A. flavus allow profitable crop production in areas that had previously experienced frequent aflatoxin contamination. The technology has been improved for use in sub-Saharan Africa, where efforts are underway to develop biocontrol products, under the trade name Aflasafe\u2122. The need for management programs that optimise both biocontrol\u2019s long-term and area-wide benefits is stressed in this paper. Benefits as well as potential apprehensions regarding this technology are discussed together with potential challenges, including the impact of CC scenarios on the production, formulation and efficacy of such biocontrol agents for aflatoxin minimisation.The 5th section in the special issue addresses the challenges in Risk assessment of multiple mycotoxins in food and consumer behaviour in relation to mycotoxins in a changing world. In this context, Assun\u00e7\u00e3o et al. (2016) emphasised that the risk of human co-exposure to multiple mycotoxins is real. There is growing concern about their potential impact on human health and regulations are not practically taking account of the risks of multiple exposure. Studies on hazard and exposure assessment of multiple mycotoxins, using harmonised methodologies, are crucial towards an improvement of data quality and a more reliable and robust risk characterisation, which is central for risk management and, consequently, to prevent mycotoxins-associated adverse effects. An in-depth understanding of the nature of interactions between multiple mycotoxins will contribute to draw real conclusions on the health impact of human exposure to mycotoxin mixtures. Ragona (2016) showed that the trends in dietary compositions in our changing world can have a great impact on the exposure of populations to harmful substances in our food, including mycotoxins. Information about changes in available food and in consumer\u2019s choices may help authorities to decide whether exposure assessments need to be updated. The article discusses and analyses the factors contributing to the global trends in food consumption and the most prominent directions are identified in order to prioritise mycotoxin risk assessment. Unmistakably substantial changes in the availability of foods and in dietary patterns take place all over the world. An example shows how changing food available for consumption influences mycotoxin exposure. Perhaps not surprising is that the (scarce) information in http://www.wageningenacademic.com/doi/pdf/10.3920/WMJ2016.x004 - Tuesday, January 03, 2017 7:18:10 AM - IP Address:138.250.27.148 Foreword650 World Mycotoxin Journal 9 (5)the literature about awareness and perception of mycotoxin risks as compared to other foodborne hazards shows an inverse relation between education level and risk perception, an observation of relevance to risk communicators. De Nijs et al. (2016) examined five strategies to estimate mycotoxin exposure of a (sub-)population via food. This addresses the issues of data collection in the context of identifying the added values and limitations of each strategy for the estimation of chronic exposure to mycotoxins and, with the exception of the observed individual mean strategy, also acute exposure. Methods for data collection, i.e. food consumption surveys, food monitoring studies and total diet studies are discussed in detail. In particular human biomonitoring studies may also include exposure to mycotoxins from other sources than food, and exposure to modified mycotoxins that may not be detected with current analytical methods. Low limits of quantification are required for all analytical methods applied for data collection to avoid large uncertainties in the exposure due to high numbers of left censored data, i.e. with levels below the limit of quantification.There is interest in the more routine use of Multi-mycotoxin analyses and this subject has been ably addressed in the 6th section by Stroka and Maragos (2016). The rapid developments that have taken place in the analysis of mycotoxins include the application of techniques for the determination of multiple mycotoxins. (See the annual updates in World Mycotoxin Journal, e.g. Berthiller et al. (2016)). Although multi-mycotoxin methods offer great opportunities to get information about a broad spectrum of (groups of ) mycotoxins in one analysis run, their use is accompanied with certain challenges. The need for co-extraction of multiple analytes with widely different polarities and the potential for carry-over of matrix components that can influence the results, are independent of the analytical techniques used (mass spectrometry or immunoassay). In addition there are specific challenges and opportunities that arise among the analytical platforms. Chromatographic methods for total aflatoxins could potentially be simplified to determine only one aflatoxin based on the use of stable response factors, which would reduce the analytical burden. Assays based on molecular recognition principles, such as immunoassays are currently no \u2018perfect\u2019 solution for multiplexed detection of mycotoxins. But these systems continue to be improved, eventually leading to fit-for-purpose methods.In the last section of this special issue two additional papers are included dealing with related topics of CC impacts on fungi involved in the contamination of coffee and the impacts that may occur in relation to aflatoxins especially for LMICs. Thus Akbar et al. (2016) examined ochratoxigenic fungi and ochratoxin A (OTA) contamination of coffee. Aspergillus westerdijkiae strains were significantly impacted by CC and a stimulation of OTA production was observed. This was consistent with data available for A. flavus. However, for other species, especially Aspergillus carbonarius and Aspergillus niger, there was a reduction in OTA production under CC conditions. This suggests that different mycotoxigenic fungi may respond differently to CC conditions and thus extrapolation needs to be done with care. The possible impact of acclimatisation of the fungi to CC conditions needs to be examined in terms of whether this will influence colonisation rates of important commodities and whether this may lead to enhanced mycotoxin production. Wambui et al. (2016) focused on LMICs and how people living in developing countries may suffer more from mycotoxins in food and feed than those living in the industrialised part of the world. Indeed, a recent report by the IARC has demonstrated the impact that aflatoxins (and fumonisins) have on human health in these countries (Wild et al., 2015). Options exist, however, to mitigate this exposure. This paper has a special focus on Kenya, where cases of human aflatoxicosis have been recurrent, but its potential scope is much wider. CC is expected to lead to shifts from the current hot-spots to new hot-spots in Kenya. If no measures are taken, overall an increased part of the population is expected to be at risk. To protect the public and the environment from this negative impact, an integrated approach is proposed with management practices ranging from agronomic, post-harvest through to institutional levels. The authors suggest a policy-oriented foresight to be developed in order to provide policy-based evidence for the applicability of the proposed measures.We believe that the contents of this special issue confirm mycotoxins as a major challenge in a changing world. The impact of CC suggests that there may be complex interacting factors between the key abiotic stresses and plant physiology which makes predictions difficult without accurate data sets. We expect that in this context the research effort to address mycotoxins and their control will become even higher on the food safety and security agenda in the coming decades.Paola Battilani, Joerg Stroka and Naresh MaganGuest editors special issue \u2018Mycotoxins in a changing world\u2019Department of Sustainable Crop Production, Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Piacenza, Italy; paola.battilani@unicatt.itJoint Research Centre, IRMM, European Commission, Geel, Belgium; joerg.stroka@ec.europa.euApplied Mycology Group, Cranfield University, Cranfield, United Kingdom; n.magan@cranfield.ac.ukhttp://www.wageningenacademic.com/doi/pdf/10.3920/WMJ2016.x004 - Tuesday, January 03, 2017 7:18:10 AM - IP Address:138.250.27.148  ForewordWorld Mycotoxin Journal 9 (5) 651ReferencesAkbar, A., Medina, A. and Magan, N., 2016.

Introduction In Africa south of the Sahara, we are confronted with enduring violent conflicts in which a clear understanding of the reasons of continuation is as important as knowing about the ori-gins. Current thinking on African conflicts is still influenced by a tendency to focus pre-dominantly on \u2018root causes\u2019 of violent conflict whose resolution is frequently beyond reach. Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  6 Africa\u2019s wars are in fact among the longest enduring in the world: some of the most striking examples are the armed conflict in the North East of Ethiopia from 1962-1991, or civil war and rebellion in Southern Sudan from 1955-72 (and from 1983 till January 2005); the war that began as a liberation war in Angola only ended in 2003, but began as far back as 1961 \u2013 this means that whole generations did not experience anything else but war. Some of these con-flicts change their nature over time, new actors and factors add to those already existing, some may leave the scene (Savimbi in Angola!), and determining the origin of a conflict sometimes becomes just an academic exercise. Frequently, some of the most important fea-tures of contemporary warfare in Africa (in terms of material and human costs) are rather those factors that prolong conflicts.  Conventional wisdom about violent conflict in Africa is still dictated by either ideological preferences or narrow institutional interests. The dominance of two competing explanatory approaches \u2013 \u2018poverty\u2019 and \u2018greed\u2019 \u2013 is not reflecting accurately what happens on the ground. Current discourses about conflict prevention might lead to very mechanical and technocratic responses to varying challenges, exacerbating an already inherent tendency in the aid business: over-simplification. However, the biggest flaw in technocratic official de-velopment assistance (ODA) related thinking is the focus on the nation-state, when an essen-tial part of the problem (and maybe even the solution) might be found on two other levels: in the local and the sub-regional arenas. Familiar conflict escalation patterns might stress this problem. In fact, African (and most other) conflicts spread in two ways: -  horizontally (territorial spread) \u2013 the crisis in the Great Lakes region is felt several thousand miles away from Lake Kivu; the Ivorian crisis has, within a few months, af-fected the whole sub-region of West Africa; and  -  vertically (in intensity) \u2013 the Rwandan genocide might not be the last on the continent. Extreme forms of violence (e.g. atrocities in the Sierra Leone civil war) and a growing number of victims in, by definition, local conflicts (e.g. in Nigeria) attest to this. Yet, the responses by the international community do not sufficiently address escalation pat-terns and the endurance of conflict. Additionally, new actors (e.g. private security firms1) and new arenas of the political game (e.g. large-scale refugee camps) emerge \u2013 policy-makers and academia alike will have to react to this. A growing literature on so-called \u2018new wars\u2019 tries to reflect these tendencies while it is not always clear how \u2018new\u2019, or rather, for how long undetected the phenomena really are. Typically, the Angolan civil war was predominantly                                                       1   Contrasting positions can be found in Musah and Fayemi 2000, Cilliers and Cornwell 1999, Lock 1998, Howe 1998, and West Africa, 18-24 September 2000. Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  7 interpreted as a proxy war during the 1980s (that is during the East-West bloc confrontation), and as an example for the \u2018economy of war\u2019-thesis in the late 1990s. Finally, one of the main shortcomings of external involvement is its short-sighted \u2018crisis re-sponse\u2019 nature; instead, what is needed is a thorough understanding of an adapted \u2018peace order\u2019.  This paper argues that there are roughly four problems that need to be addressed if conflict prevention policy in Africa is to lead to more positive results in the future: 1.  In academia and practice there is a dangerous mix-up of types of conflict causes: While an understanding of \u2018root causes\u2019 or their main expressions is vital for a correct analysis, an understanding of escalation patterns and a correct assessment of \u2018conflict prolonging (or sustaining) factors\u2019 should inform concrete short-term action. 2.  There is nearly no common understanding of conflict causes by international actors \u2013 leading to incoherent, uncoordinated and therefore ineffective action. 3.  There is a lack of vision (locally and internationally) about the final goals when en-gaging in conflict prevention. Without a holistic view of African societies\u2019 capacities to live in peace with themselves and their neighbours, any well-meant action might simply fail to produce effects.  4.  There is an exaggerated focus on the African nation-state. A parallel shift of perspec-tive in conflict analysis, prevention and resolution from the national towards the local and the sub-regional level is necessary. A good number of current conflicts have trans-boundary effects, but start locally (Engel/Mehler 2005).  This paper is organised as follows: Following this introduction, the second section argues for a correct differentiation of conflict causes \u2013 stressing the importance of conflict prolonging factors. These are specified in some detail in the third section. The fourth section deals with \u2018official\u2019 conceptions of (African) conflicts and conflict prevention by some major actors \u2013 showing that the \u2018conventional wisdom\u2019 is not even a homogeneous one. Finally, section five, by drawing conclusions and giving some perspectives, develops core aspects of a prac-tical and heuristic leitmotiv helping to situate preventive strategies and activities in the co-ordinate system of a forward-looking approach of contributing to a \u2018peace order\u2019 or \u2018struc-tural stability\u2019. It argues for re-assessing the role of the nation-state level as much in analysis as in practical aid, calling attention towards the local and sub-regional levels.    Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  8 2. The Case for Adequate Differentiation of Conflict Causes  The state of knowledge on the causation of African conflicts in academia is far from being satisfactory. Different schools of thought still tend to ignore each other and follow incom-plete sets of research questions: Some of the rare researchers working on African conflicts worked with the \u2018universalist\u2019 approaches of peace research developed mainly in the context of the Cold War and the OECD world (Reychler 1997). Others picked very specific segments of explanatory factors: either the result of ethno-regionally, economically or politically moti-vated excessive demands to increasingly inefficient governments (Zartman 1985, Joseph 1999). Poverty is a simplistic (but welcome) explanation for violent conflict offered by some researchers.2 Failure of clientelist integration after flawed reforms of neo-patrimonial systems is still another offered explanation.3 More complex schemes distinguish a) conflict patterns associated with the competition over the control of the state and rare resources, from b) calls for autonomy/independence or other demands by particular social groups, also adding the historical factor of the end of the East-West confrontation with its consequential loss of pa-tronage once exerted by external powers (leading to the destabilisation of some authoritarian regimes).4 The author believes that an even more differentiated list of problem areas as mani-festations of highly abstract root causes (developed elsewhere, see van de Goor et al. 2001) is needed in order to distil typical chains of causation \u2013 from \u2018root causes\u2019, aggravating or ac-celerating factors to conflict prolonging (or sustaining) factors and triggers: 1.  root causes of conflict are underlying characteristics arising from historical dominant economical, political and social institutions, practices or other dispositions; 2.  aggravating or accelerating factors refer to aspects and circumstances, which con-tribute to a (re-)escalation of a conflict situation. These factors emerge medium-term; 3.  conflict prolonging (or sustaining) factors contribute to the predominance of logics of war over logics of peace after an escalation of violence has taken place. Sustaining war efforts essentially depend on economic, institutional and ideological rationales; 4.  triggers aren\u2019t the (root) causes of conflict but constitute more proximate events or factors and create situations, in which a violent escalation of conflict occurs.                                                       2    See the largely economist contributions in Journal of African Economies, 9 (2000) 3 (Special Is-sue/Economic Commission for Africa Policy Issue: Conflict);and Solomon 1999. For Copson (1994), poverty is a \u2018contributing factor\u2019, while the main reason of conflict are varying forms of contradic-tions between state and society. 3   See Allen 1999 (with a discussion of further explanatory elements: new barbarism; economies of war; globalisation approaches; approaches using social, cultural and individual factors) and Schlichte 1996. On neo-patrimonialism see van de Walle 2001, Chabal and Daloz 1999. 4   Matthies 1998 highlights additional problems of nation-building and elements of group mobilisa-tion. Patterns of mobilisation are important as well for Lemarchand 2001. Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  9 One example might be enough to explain the need to differentiate conflict causes5: A typical (root) cause of violent conflict in Africa south of the Sahara is the emergence of an exclusive government elite: It can be characterised briefly: Key decision-making positions in the presi-dency, cabinet, parliament, military and judiciary do not include representatives of major identity groups. In addition, most jobs in the civil service, police force and army are reserved for members of one or two specific groups. Different dynamics may start from this point of departure: 1. A continuation of the main conflict aided by institutional devices excluding minorities (e.g. high thresholds to win mandates in Parliament); those could become a con-flict-prolonging factor (although not necessarily on a violent level); 2. There could be a ten-dency to even further contract the political arena, particularly when economic crisis affects a given state-apparatus. Already privileged circles usually have better means to keep their jobs, privileges, access to opportunities etc. in times of crisis \u2013 and exclusion could become a rational strategy by those. But exclusion is a radical strategy and is likely to be countered by equally radical strategies on the part of those excluded. If the formal political process does not provide for a solution, the excluded elite groups will tend to initiate attempts to over-throw the regime (Burundi is a classical example). In particular, formerly privileged elite groups pushed aside or prosecuted by a new elite will more likely be tempted by violent adventures (the Yakoma followers of ex-president Kolingba in Central African Republic un-der the rule of Ange-F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9 offer a typical case). What then are the patterns of escalation? At first, a specific group might simply enjoy privi-leged access to strategic positions. Gradually, the government payroll is \u2018homogenised\u2019; and only one group is left represented (example: the last years of Habyarimana rule in Rwanda when not only Hutu, but particularly those from his home region, occupied most important positions) \u2013 this clearly represents an aggravating factor. If elections are held, marginal groups vote unsuccessfully for opposition parties headed by excluded elite groups. These leaders go underground and organise armed challenges to the incumbent regime. Disloyal conduct in-creases and leads to further polarisation. A composite power-base of the regime might split, leaving only a minority in power (arguably this happened in the last year of Patass\u00e9\u2019s reign in Central African Republic after the forced defection of then chief of staff Gen. Boziz\u00e9). In the final stage, pogroms and ethnic cleansing begin to occur, representing the triggering event and the entry into a new level of escalation.                                                        5   The CPN \u2018practical guide\u2019 (op. cit.) distinguishes 17 so-called problem-areas with respective escala-tion patterns. Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  10 3. Conflict Prolonging Factors The mainstream thinking of conflict resolution believes that conflicts attain a moment of \u2018ripeness for resolution\u2019 (Zartman 1985). But these moments arrive late, if at all. In many con-temporary conflicts, de-escalation is frequently merely temporary, while the antagonists prepare for the next battle. Most of the factors shortly presented hereafter have obviously gained in importance during the last decade. One very influential approach is the \u2018political economy of war\u2019 approach. In an extreme form, which is its \u2018greed\u2019 hypothesis propagated by several writings of the economists Collier and Hoeffler, this approach is ultimately re-duced to the personal ambitions of warlords and political entrepreneurs. In resource-rich African states there are indeed possibilities to fund war efforts or to make \u2018easy money\u2019 un-der war conditions. But curiously enough, \u2018greed\u2019 (meaning the search for opportunities for predation, like the control of primary commodity exports) is portrayed as the (major) conflict cause, while it should appropriately be classified as a prolonging factor or \u2018fuel\u2019 of conflict. Several writers with an African studies background have heavily criticised the Col-lier/Hoeffler approach. Marchal and Messiant (2002) have decried the inherent narrow per-spective and methodological flaws. Mkandawire (2002: 190) reminds us that  \u201cConstraining rebel actions for the pursuit of material interests leaves out a whole range of things that drive rebel movements \u2013 \u2018Passions\u2019, moral agency, \u2018false consciousness\u2019 \u2013 which are important in untangling the many complex conflicts afflicting Africa today.\u201d Collier et al. (2003) have now differentiated their thoughts, but still remain in a largely econometric rationale (as criticized by Lemarchand 2003). Richards and Vlassenroot (2002) show how a sociological approach inspired by Durkheim would, for instance, shift the \u2018exal-tation\u2019 aspect of African conflicts to the foreground. In sum, there is reason to believe that economic factors are central to understanding the en-durance of conflicts (although they are not the only ones, see the institutional factor of elec-toral rules above), but they do not necessarily reveal anything about the emergence of con-flict. And: By no means should economic factors be reduced to the \u2018greed\u2019 explanation. A small overview of a selection of typical war-prolonging factors in African circumstances might support this argument:  3.1. Oil and Warfare  There are quite a few oil-producing countries in Africa that have experienced violent conflict. Oil resources/revenues\u2013 and this is a more complex argument than the \u2018greed\u2019 thesis \u2013 can become a motive to circumvent democracy, since governments gain far more from rents and royalties than from taxes by their own ordinary citizens (Herb 2003, Moore 2004, Ross 2001, Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  11 2003a/b, Snyder/Bhavnani 2004). Thus, they tend to be less responsive to demands for par-ticipation (virtually all oil economies in Africa: Libya, Algeria, Gabon, Angola, Congo Braz-zaville, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria, Sudan, and as a newcomer: Chad). In this sense they can be at the origin of violent conflict. More often, however, oil resources rather serve to prolong conflicts: -  Royalties or other oil-related transfers can be used to buy arms or reinforce military capacities to continue violent conflict (Chad, Angola, Sudan). -  Oil producers in conflict zones get involved in ongoing wars. Their premises are used for military interventions (Sudan), they may side willingly or unwillingly with con-flict parties (Congo-Brazzaville). Despite the generally assumed \u2018resource curse\u2019 or the \u2018paradox of plenty\u2019 (which often refers to oil besides other natural resources like diamonds etc.) one has to stress the fact, that,  \u201cwhether oil or other resources turn out to be beneficial or detrimental to a country\u2019s socio-economic and political development depends on a fairly dynamic and complex interplay of con-textual variables\u201d (Basedau 2005: 22).  The \u2018resource curse\u2019 is not destiny, as Ross (2003a) and Basedau (2005) point out. Country specific and resource specific conditions have to be taken into account.  3.2. Illegal Trafficking of Precious Resources Precious resources, like diamonds, gold, hardwood or other rare natural resources are tran-siting national frontiers illegally. Warlords are generally military entrepreneurs in search of control of the production sites and trade routes of these commodities. This, today, is conven-tional wisdom. However, trade profits essentially permit the continuation of politico-commercial strategies, they rarely represent \u2018square one\u2019 in a complicated game.6 Govern-ments in weak states tend to be corrupted slowly, but pervasively by criminal networks and might become actors in violent conflict (Debiel 2002). Once again: it is misleading to start conflict analysis only with the effects of illegal trafficking. It might be essential to address them, but this needs to be done, as well, by looking into the conditions of their emergence (including the weakness of the African state). Again context matters.                                                       6   Addison, Le Billon and Murshed (2003) find that in several cases under scrutiny, actors prefer low intensity conflict to outright victory, minimising direct losses and increasing the direct gains (booty).  Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  12 3.3. Small Arms and War as a Profession Small arms are available at low cost in expanding zones around escalated conflicts. The most common approach to the problem is the regulation of arms exports from Northern countries. This conventional way of addressing small arms proliferation is of limited value: Small arms and ammunition are produced as well in other, including African countries (e.g. RSA). More importantly, the destruction of weapons necessitates their prior collection, an activity which frequently demands material input by donor organisations (\u2018arms for cash\u2019), which in turn may be an incentive for becoming a fighter in the first place (\u2018demobilisation rent\u2019): arms collection, demobilisation and reintegration schemes might have perverse (conflict prolong-ing) effects, if beneficiaries are exclusively those who took up arms in the first place. In en-during conflicts, becoming a fighter is \u2013 on an individual level \u2013 a rational alternative to less promising opportunities on the labour market, particularly for male youth. Fighters may not necessarily be paid, but live from armed blackmail and looting. The traumatising effects of violence is particularly harmful for children and adolescents. This may be the starting point for a \u2018career\u2019 from victim to perpetrator and thus a \u2018conflict prolonging factor\u2019 or a \u2018conflict reproducing factor\u2019.   3.4. Declining States  Some African states were simply juridical fictions when they became independent, others turned gradually into fa\u00e7ade states. This is not only a conflict cause, it also has consequences for conflict resolution: In the absence of responsible governments there are often no credible partners for peace negotiations \u2013 a conflict prolonging factor. Another aspect of conflict pro-longation is the gradual replacement of the \u2013 at least claimed \u2013 monopoly of violence by a multiplication of actors in continued \u201dneed\u201d to prove their capacity of violence in order to command respect and allegiance. The case of Somalia remains an extreme case, where the absence of a state \u2013 despite numerous efforts to support local \u2018peace constituencies\u2019 \u2013 clearly proved to be to the detriment of peace in large parts of the country.  3.5. Diaspora and Other Factors The existence of a diaspora sustaining war efforts from abroad might be an additional con-flict prolonging factor, as could be certain ideologies, revenge cultures or religions. Some conflict prolonging factors are associated with the aid business (Uvin 1998, 2001; Anderson 1999). This enumeration is certainly not exhaustive.  Conflict prolonging factors might be more visible, more salient to those concerned and more modifiable than \u2018root causes\u2019 as argued above. And since the endurance of war creates im-Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  13 mense costs, there is every reason to deal with these causes in a much more systematic way than experienced thus far. On the other hand, there is no reason to believe that violence at-tributable directly to \u2018root causes\u2019 would simply disappear when the \u2018fuel\u2019 is taken out of a conflict arena. After the outbreak of violence, the answer seems to be clear: Dealing first with prolonging factors and addressing root causes immediately afterwards. It would be better still to prevent triggering events first, but they can hardly be predicted.   4. The Diverging and Simplistic Understanding of Conflict Causes by International Actors The practitioner\u2019s understanding of violent conflict is frequently informed by official per-spectives. However, we observe severe flaws and distinctive variations in the analysis of the causes of violent conflict in Africa by major external actors which could lead to short-sighted and contradictory policies by national governments and international organisations.  At first sight, there are obvious reasons why different actors should have different percep-tions of conflict causes: those have to fit their \u2018Weltbild\u2019 (ideology), their mandate and prior positions defended in their respective arenas of action. A closer look reveals that there are quite some contradictions between governments, but even between departments of one and the same government. This chapter does not, however, aim at explaining the behaviour of international actors or unfold their complex decision-making processes. The objective is a more limited one: comparing the (official) explanations of conflict causes with each other and pointing to the dangers of inherent flaws. Instead of rational analysis, superficial and contra-dictory perceptions of conflicts in Africa seem to influence policies of most external actors. Some typical positions of certain major actors should be briefly reported and commented, although there are difficulties in finding texts that can at least roughly be compared and are significant in themselves: Not all the actors have similarly grounded policy papers; some address conflict causes only in an implicit way. Very often the policy is outlined without a reference to some prior analytical work. Some of the policy papers and programmatic decla-rations used here are not Africa-specific (focusing on the developing world), but certainly cover the African continent \u2013 which raises the question of whether they are specific enough to address concrete conflicts.7                                                       7   It will be focused on the international donors. Further research should address the conceptualisa-tion of violent conflicts done by the African Union, subregional organisations and major INGOs. Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  14 4.1. The United Nations With regard to the continuum conflict prevention \u2013 peace-enforcement, the United Nations can claim considerable authority worldwide (Barnett 2001, Hampson/Malone 2002, Sriram/Wermester 2003). The United Nations\u2019 Secretary General has published one of the most influential reports on the causes of conflict in Africa (Annan 1998). He stresses histori-cal legacies (colonial frontiers, political legacies and commercial relations established under colonial rule, support for authoritarian regimes during the Cold War era), juxtaposes internal factors (nature of power, winner-takes-all systems, politicisation of ethnicity, etc.) and exter-nal factors (economic interests \u2013 competition for resources, destabilisation by neighbouring states). He cites effects of war economies and adds some secondary factors in \u2018particular situations\u2019 (land right problem). This is certainly one of the most comprehensive and differ-entiated approaches to be found in policy papers worldwide. Most UN organisations refer to this document and apparently do not need their own concept.8 Meanwhile UN Secretary General Annan has made the prevention of armed conflict one of the top priorities of his sec-ond term. His Report on the Prevention of Armed Conflict calls for a paradigm shift from a cul-ture of reaction to a culture of prevention of conflict. The report marks a beginning in the UN\u2019s willingness and development agenda to address the deep-rooted socio-economic, cul-tural, environmental, institutional and other structural causes that often underlie the imme-diate political symptoms of conflicts.  4.2. The European Union The EU has rhetorically endorsed conflict prevention relatively early on (in 1995), particu-larly with regard to Africa.  Drawing on Council Conclusions from 1998 the EU\u2019s Conflict Prevention Network cited 1) imbalance of political, socio-economic or cultural opportunities among different identity groups, 2) lack of democratic legitimacy and effectiveness of governance, 3) absence of op-portunities for the peaceful conciliation of group interests and for bridging dividing lines                                                       8   Under the agenda title \u201cNew Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development: progress in implementation and international support: causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa\u201d the United Nations General Assembly presented on September 5, 2003 a follow-up report \u201cImplementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secre-tary-General on the causes of conflict and development in Africa\u201d. Here the UN addresses specific follow-up actions taken since 1998 and identifies further challenges and obstacles for the imple-mentation of the recommendations made by the Secretary-General. (http://www.un.dk/doc/ a58352.pdf, access 12/22/2004). The UNDP has commissioned an interesting independent study (Wood 2001), updated in 2003. In the absence of a more official paper the Annan-Report 1998 and its follow-ups seems to be its current position. Current research is been done by the \u201cWar-Torn-Societies Transition Programm\u201d (WSP-TP) (http://www.wsp-international.org/index.htm). Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  15 between different identity groups, and 4) lack of an active and organised civil society as root causes of violent conflict.9 The EU Commission in its 2001 communication on conflict preven-tion (not Africa-specific) rather elusively calls for an \u2018enhanced common analysis of root causes of conflict and of signs of emerging conflict\u2019. This sounds as if there would be a grow-ing uncertainty about these causes of conflict. The text adds that  \u201c[p]overty, economic stagnation, uneven distribution of resources, weak social structures, un-democratic governance, systematic discrimination, oppression of the rights of minorities, de-stabilising effects of refugee flows, ethnic antagonisms, religious and cultural intolerance, so-cial injustice and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and small arms are factors which aggravate conflict.\u201d10  In a Council Common Position, economic factors (lack of integration in the global economy, illegal exploitation and trade in high value commodities, illegal exploitation of natural re-sources) are highlighted, at the same time the security sector and the spread of small arms are as well cited (Council of the European Union 2001a). And finally \u2013 also coming from the Council side \u2013 the EU Programme for the Prevention of Violent Conflicts, an initiative of the Swedish Presidency, is not proposing any conflict causes or analytical framework (Council of the European Union 2001b). This short description shows that the EU, today, is far away from the assertiveness expressed earlier with regard to a comprehensive set of conflict causes.11 More (implied) conceptualised work has been done in the area of peace-keeping.12                                                       9   Lund et al. 1999. The Commission insisted on these four root causes while the authors developed 16 (later 17) more down-to-earth \u2018problem areas\u2019 to focus on different conflict causes. An electronic format of this guide was left off in a draft stage when the CPN contract was discontinued at the end of 2001 and definitely buried by the Commission in early 2003, see van de Goor et al. 2001. 10  See European Commission 2001. In its report on this communication the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy of the European Parliament (Rap-porteur: Joost Lagendijk) considers that \u2018a further step could be taken by assessing and preventing the impact that certain major decisions adopted in the framework of the common policies of the Union could have as direct or indirect causes of certain conflicts, namely by distorting or even an-nihilating the economic and social structure of the poorest countries\u2019 (A5-0394/2001, RR\\302075 EN.doc). 11   A EU Presidency Statement on conflicts in Africa at the UN security council (May 30, 2003) con-firms the unspecified concern with all sorts of conflict causes put on the same level of explanation: \u2018Identifying and addressing the multidimensional root causes of conflict in Africa is another impor-tant element in the long fight towards peace and stability in the region. Dealing with issues like, in-ter alia, socio-economic inequities and inequalities, systematic ethnic discrimination, denial of hu-man rights, disputes over political participation or long-standing grievances over land, the illicit proliferation of small arms and light weapons, the plight of refugees and internally displaced per-sons and the illegal exploitation of natural resources is of critical importance in the process of mov-ing from conflict management to prevention and final resolution\u2019 (http://europa-eu-un.org/ article.asp?id=2430; access 04/08/2003). To deepen the confusion on the existing papers see the \u201cEuropean Commission Check-list for Root Causes of Conflict\u201d. Here the EC has developed a check-list for root causes/early warning indicators with 8 subject headings and several sub-points (http://europa.eu.int/comm/external_relations/cpcm/cp/list.htm, access 02/25/2005). Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  16 4.3. The World Bank The World Bank has for a long time preferred to work on conflict consequences (only in post-conflict scenarios) and not on conflict causes. Nevertheless, towards the late 1990s the Bank has redefined its role and shifted its approach from one that focused on rebuilding infra-structure to one that seeks to understand the root causes of conflict, to integrate a sensitivity to conflict in Bank activities and to promote assistance that minimizes the potential causes of conflict.  A workshop report under the inspiration of the Bank\u2019s Post-Conflict Unit in 1998 cited \u2018ineq-uity, exclusion, and indignity\u2019 as conflict causes (World Bank 1998), while some economist researchers associated with the World Bank have developed the famous \u2018greed and griev-ance\u2019 formula, attributing the causes of a high proportion of violent conflicts to the personal greed of rebels and warlords (Collier/Hoeffler 2000; see above). Separately, a somewhat par-ticular focus was on environmental causes and consequences of conflict (World Bank 2001). Meanwhile, at the turn of the millennium the World Bank officially concentrated (again) on its mandate: \u201dAlthough poverty is not the only cause of conflict, development can enhance resilience to violent conflict and address some of the structural causes of conflict\u201d. While socio-economic factors dominate in this perspective, the presentation of conflict causes is in the end also highly contradictory. In a task force report on \u2018Low Income Countries under Stress\u2019 (LICUS) the World Bank identified several types of countries with weak governance all more or less closely linked to recent episodes of violent conflict, but without making con-flict prevention or peace-building the ultimate aim of engagement (World Bank 2002). The Bank\u2019s more recent report \u201cBreaking the Conflict Trap\u201d argues against a greed-based interpretation of rebellion. \u201cLoot is not usually the root motivation for conflict, but it may become critical to its perpetuation, giving rise to the conflict trap\u201d (Collier et al 2003: 79). This acknowledgment of a separate meaning of conflict prolonging factors deserves recognition. The report claims inter alia that stagnant or declining low-income countries face a high risk of conflict and that countries in the first decade of post-conflict peace face exceptionally high risks to fall back into conflict. It is difficult to escape the conflict trap \u2013 conflict breeds con-flict: \u201eFirst and foremost, post-conflict countries face a high risk of reverting to conflict, espe-cially during the first five years. \u2026. Post-conflict countries often confront massive human,                                                                                                                                                                       12   One has to highlight the November 2003 General Affairs Council approval of a draft decision to use the European Development Fund (EDF) to create a Peace Facility for Africa in line with the plea of the African Union. The EU will provide 250 million Euro for this purpose. Its intention is clear: \u201cA contribution to the task of addressing the root causes of insecurity in Africa\u201d (European Commission 2004, see also Faria 2004: 5, 32 f.). The final step in this context was the announcement on May 25, 2004 that the African Peace Facility to support African Peace keeping missions is opera-tionalized. Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  17 physical, economic, social and institutional dislocation, and the choices they must make are correspondingly more difficult\u201d (World Bank 2004: 14). The solution proposed in 2003 sounded straightforward: the effect of a package of policy reform and increased aid on the average aid-recipient country would reduce the risk of con-flict (without giving convincing explanations for this and obviously offering good additional advice). But the assertiveness is in decline: \u201cThere is no consensus, let alone best practices, on how to integrate the conflict nexus or the key elements of conflict-affected PRSP processes.\u201d The World Bank begins to consider its own homework: \u201cEconomic policies also need to be more flexible, taking into account the specific constraints resulting from conflict and the pri-mary objective of ensuring peace and political stability\u201d (World Bank 2004: 14-15). Recent efforts by the Bank to support political change by promoting reform-oriented actors, institution building, good governance, measures to improve transparency in the trade of energy (oil and gas) and other commodities that are often linked to conflicts (diamonds, tim-ber, precious metals) show a growing sensitivity to the political economy of conflict. Those are primarily managed and designed through the Conflict Prevention and Reconstruction Unit and the Development Research Group.13 However, poverty remains an important starting point of the conceptual reflections, al-though in a complex manner:  \u201cCountries affected by conflict face a two-way relationship between conflict and poverty\u2013pervasive poverty makes societies more vulnerable to violent conflict, while conflict itself cre-ates more poverty. At the same time, conflict has a negative effect on the ability of countries to formulate poverty reduction strategies\u201d (World Bank 2004: 14).  The World Bank, by implementing its Operational Policy/Bank Procedures 2.30 (OP/BP2.30), puts a sharper focus on the need to adapt Poverty Reduction Strategy processes and best practices to take account of the special circumstances of countries where conflict is a key de-velopment issue (World Bank 2004: 1). Hence the World Bank increased its interests in gain-ing a better understanding of the rapidly-evolving field of conflict prevention in its many aspects and across its many institutional actors.  This conclusion is not necessarily in opposition to another conclusion: One has to emphasize the missing link in the World Bank\u2019s research activities on its own reform programme, the PRS, structural adjustment policy and conflict. Existing PRSPs for a large number of conflict                                                       13   One also has to consider the research done by the Governance of Natural Resources Project, based at the Centre for the Study of Civil War (CSCW), Norway, a collaborative effort of PRIO and World Bank (http://www.prio.no/page/CSCW_research_detail/CSCW_programs_projects/9649/42486.html, access 01/05/2005). See also the reflective work done by the Conflict Prevention and Reconstruction Unit, Social Development Department Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development Network (World Bank 2004). Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  18 countries and weak governance environments miss to (or seldom) address the underlying root causes of violent conflicts, and the specific characteristics of poverty, related to these violent conflicts. Therefore care should be taken on alignment and harmonisation of the PRSPs and the Conflict Analysis Framework (CAF).14 It is in fact the bringing together of all its knowledge in compatible forms and their coordinated and concerned application in con-flict-vulnerable societies, which is needed (Lund 2004).  4.4. OECD DAC The OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) is largely a co-ordination body with no direct authority in international affairs and on Africa, but with considerable influence in the development of guidelines for action. In its policy statement on Conflict, Peace and Development Cooperation on the Threshold of the 21st Century the DAC listed as sources of conflict: Problems in managing transition and rapid change, widening socio-economic disparities, the exploitation of ethnic and other dif-ferences, competition over shared resources and the legacy of violence.15 In a follower docu-ment it becomes increasingly unclear what accounts for a conflict factor or an early warning indicator.16 The more recent focus on \u2018poor performers\u2019, \u2018difficult environments\u2019 or \u2018difficult partnerships\u2019 by the OECD DAC deviates from the conflict analysis perspective and instead stresses the \u2018failing states\u2019 aspect. Indeed, the OECD DAC confesses that development con-straints are poorly understood. Hence the High Level Meeting of Ministers established a \u2018Learning and Advisory Process\u2019 (LAP) in 2003, which integrates the European Commission, the UNDP and World Bank, to reflect jointly about development effectiveness in difficult environments. LAP seeks to contribute to an agenda of knowledge sharing and the promo-tion of the \u2018policy coherence for development\u2018 (PCD) initiative of the OECD.17 These initia-tives turn explicitly against simplistic and futile theories of state deterioration and conflict (e.g. the \u2018resource course\u2019-thesis, the \u2018greed vs. grievance\u2019-debate, \u2018conflict cycle\u2019). They \u201clead                                                       14   The research on conflict causes has been boiled down into Conflict Assessment Frameworks (CAF). These CAFs are being used by donor agencies to assess the potential for conflict in many particular countries. But they reports are not yet integrated into existing general development assistance frameworks. 15   OECD DAC 2001: 87-89. The document contains the older Guidelines Conflict, Peace and Devel-opment Cooperation on the Threshold of the 21st Century (1997) as an annex. 16   OECD DAC 2001: 31-32. 17   Besides the attempts of LAP and PCD to harmonize and implement policy coherence between do-nor-countries and \u2013institutions, the OECD proposes a \u2018developmental peacekeeping\u2019 approach and highlights \u2013 under the aegis of the \u2018DAC Network on Conflict, Peace and Development Coopera-tion\u2019 (CPDC) \u2013 special areas such as security sector reform, emerging issues and crisis countries, a development cooperation lens on terrorism prevention and the impacts of aid in situations of vio-lent conflict. An enhancement of the DAC-guidelines can be expected in the near future. Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  19 to misconceived programs that may have symbolic value but little practical effect. \u2026 The dynamics of conflict are discontinuous and sequential approaches are far less effective than \u201cjoined up\u201d strategies that combine all policy tools in a coherent package of inducements and restraints\u201d (OECD 2005: 6).  4.5. The G8 (and Its Africa Action Plan) It took long until the G8 countries could agree to devote resources and efforts to helping Af-rica prevent and manage its conflicts in order to promote social stability and create a more enabling environment for development. At its summit in Kananaskis (Canada) in June 2002 the G8 declared its willingness to assist Africa directly by its own efforts to undertake peace support operations. Therefore a G8 Africa Action Plan was signed, unfortunately without including an agreed set of conflict causes. Critically, the initiative sprang from African nations themselves, but African leaders bowed to Western pressure alike. The African leaders called the West\u2019s bluff by signalling in the NEPAD-process their willingness to implement reforms. In return, it was hoped Western nations would raise the plight of Africa up their political agenda. At this point the G8 initia-tive stepped in. The plan contains an initiative on peace and security. Unfortunately, it has no clear analytical basis; conflict causes have to be deducted from the objectives. The main aim of the initiative is to \u201cprovide technical and financial assistance so that, by 2010, African countries and re-gional and sub-regional organizations are able to engage more effectively to prevent and resolve violent conflict on the continent.\u201d Africa, with Western help, will be encouraged to form its own peacekeeping force and to enhance general conflict management capacities. In addition the G8 pledged support for ongoing conflict management efforts in countries such as the DRC, Sudan, Angola, and Sierra Leone. However, there is no common \u2013 G8 and NEPAD \u2013 understanding of conflict causes. The Evian Summit (France) in 2003 reiterated these commitments and focused specifically on the pledge to provide support for an African capacity for peace operations. The three-step approach intends to create a joint plan for developing African capability to undertake peace support operations, to train African peace support forces, including through the develop-ment of regional centres of excellence to train military and civilian personnel in conflict pre-vention and peace support, and to better coordinate peacekeeping training initiatives. Special foci were put on reducing the number of small arms circulating in Africa, helping African countries rid themselves of anti-personnel mines, getting close scrutiny of the link between conflict and pillage of natural resources, ending illicit trafficking of weapons and outlawing Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  20 mercenary activities. While all those aspects seem important, there is hardly any convincing analytical backbone for the formulation of priorities or the sequence of actions. Some of the most powerful nation-states have developed their own concepts, although it is true that they frequently refer to the UN, the OECD DAC or the EU as common frameworks. Here too, a short oversight might highlight the distinctions:  4.6. United Kingdom Rhetorically, conflict prevention plays a big role in the UK\u2019s policy toward Africa in particu-lar, but also in Foreign Affairs in general (Kapila/Wermester 2002).18 There is a cross-departmental co-ordination committee between the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), the Ministry of Defence (MOD), and the Department for International Development (DFID) in association with the Cabinet Office and HM Treasury, called Africa Conflict Pre-vention Pool. The official home-page entry on \u2018UK Conflict Prevention Initiative for Africa\u2019 is explicit. Root causes of conflict here  \u201cinclude political, economic and social exclusion, poor governance and corruption, manipula-tion of ethnicity, and abuse of human rights. Africa also needs to address the weaknesses of its regional security structures and conflict prevention mechanisms\u201d (Foreign and Common-wealth Office 2002).19  This was not exactly the result of a consultation process initiated by DFID on behalf of the co-ordination body: DFID put a consultation document on the web titled \u2018the causes of con-flict in Africa\u2019 in May 2001. Its consolidated version (October 2001) stressed inequality be-tween groups, weak states and state collapse, economic decline and economic shock, \u2018histori-cal factors\u2019 (history of resolving problems by violent means), and natural resource wealth as root causes of conflict. As \u2018secondary causes\u2019 it adds widespread unemployment, lack of education and population pressure, the abuse of ethnicity and the availability of arms, as \u2018tertiary causes\u2019 inter alia the regional and interlocking nature of many conflicts, \u2018lack of ex-ternal guarantors\u2019, inadequate and inappropriate mediation and misplaced humanitarian and development assistance.20 Furthermore, in spring 2001, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook stressed poverty as prime conflict cause: \u2018Poverty breeds conflict\u2019.21 Still, with the founding                                                       18   The UK stands out for emphasising security and reconciliation \u2013 the two peace-building categories that are non-traditional within development cooperation \u2013 as well as for its emphasis on projects that are not specific to a recipient country but are regional, global or thematic in scope (DFID 2003). 19   http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&c=Page&cid= 1017756005037 (access 12/22/2004). 20   DFID 2001: 14-16. DFID: The causes of conflict in Africa. Consultation document, March 2001. 21  Robin Cook: Preventing Conflict in Sub-Saharan Africa, Speech by the Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, to the conference on conflict prevention in Sub-Saharan Africa, London, 26 March 2001, Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  21 of the institutional innovation (Global and Africa) Conflict Prevention Pools (CPP) in April 2001, a watershed in British development cooperation policy was marked. The pools are not in themselves a strategy for conflict prevention, but rather a tool for joint analysis, financing and coordination. Seen in international perspective, the system is highly innovative, and has influenced other donor governments. But, the CCP system still requires more strategic clar-ity.22 The UK has geographic and thematic strategies, but there seems to be a gap at both ends of the spectrum. In some cases projects lack connection to a country strategy because there is no country strategy. In other cases, there is a country strategy to which some but not all projects are linked. In yet others, a strategy can be derived from project documentation or other sources (such as interviews), but it has not been written down and formalised (DFID 2003: 30ff., Ministry of Foreign Affairs [Norway] 2004: 43). The UK also places considerable emphasis on working through both inter-governmental organisations (IGOs) and NGOs. Important points are working thematically on regional and global levels, improving policy instruments, research, and strengthening multilateral institutions. And, recently, DFID has recognized how important it is to work more effectively within weak states \u2013 again ahead of other donor organisations (DFID 2005). In sum, in British conflict prevention policies towards Africa, there have been positive results and innovative approaches. Unfortunately, London\u2019s attempts to promote peace in Africa have been selective, inconsistent, contradictory, under-resourced, narrowly focused and pre-occupied with managing rather than preventing violent conflicts (Williams 2004b: 46-48).  4.7. United States of America U.S. interests in Africa were for a long time considered to be commercial in essence. The Sep-tember 11 aftermath is beginning to modify policy goals over time (Berman 2004, Hentz 2004), towards \u2018national interest\u2019 in African oil and the \u2018war against terrorism\u2019. However, an official US conception of violent conflicts in Africa is still difficult to find. US Ambassador to ECOSOC, Betty King, in a statement in the General Assembly on the Causes of Conflict in Africa expressed doubts concerning the explanatory value of poverty, ethnic division, reli-gious difference and colonial boundaries when she proposed: \u2018Perhaps the true cause of con-                                                                                                                                                                      mimeo. In surprising self-confidence he stated at the very end of his speech: \u2018Modern technology lets us know exactly where, when and why conflict is taking place\u2019. 22  Examination of policy documents shows the persistence of conceptual uncertainties. Further, to have a strategy is one thing but whether it covers what it needs to is another; some strategies reveal less coherence than others, and the cycles of strategic planning and budgeting do not match. According to the \u2018Utstein study\u2019, the majority of British projects lack strategic connections, and if so, in many cases the links appear to be superficial and little more than pro forma (Ministry of Foreign Affairs [Norway] 2004: 43). Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  22 flict in Africa is unaccountable governance\u201923, but this cannot easily be taken as a balanced policy statement. Other lists of conflict causes are broad and unspecific: In its presentation of their Greater Horn of Africa Initiative proposal for fiscal year 1998 the USAID offers a plain statement without any further explanation \u2018The root causes of conflict are often political, economic or environmental\u2019.24 In a \u2018conflict code\u2019 the agency defines conflict as  \u201ca struggle over values or claims to status, power (e.g., through the politicization of identity) and scarce yet economically viable resources (e.g., land, water, natural resources, minerals and food)\u2026\u201d25  More recently, in 2002, an Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation (CMM) has been established, that should, inter alia, develop vulnerability analyses and assessment tools. It might not be surprising that USAID in a list of initiatives foreseen for the fiscal year 2003 wants to focus on those natural resources that illicitly generate finances to fuel conflict, such as diamonds, timber and gold, while the conflict-related effects of (legal) oil production are left out.26 On August 20, 2003 the State Department and USAID published their \u201cStrategic Plan\u201d for the fiscal years 2004-2009.27 Guided by the prior idea to protect US national interests, the strategy stresses the objective to \u201cavert and resolve local and regional conflicts to preserve peace\u201d. By \u201cbuilding the foundations for stability and addressing the root causes of conflict\u201d develop-ment assistance shall be provided. The strategy defines causes of conflict as following:  \u201cInstability and conflict among states arise from diverse causes. Ethnic hatred, unequal eco-nomic opportunities, and political discrimination within states can lead to instability and refugee flows that spill across borders. Societies that lack means of dissent can nurture radical ideologies that appeal those who feel threatened by existing norms and arrangements. Often, legitimate grievances provide opportunities for unscrupulous or shortsighted leaders who ex-                                                      23   Ambassador Betty King: Statement in the General Assembly on the Causes of Conflict and Promo-tion of Durable Peace and Sustainable Development in Africa, November 1, 2000 (http://www.un.int/usa/ 00_155.htm, access 12/23/2004). 24   http://www.usaid.gov/pubs/cp98/afr/zz-ghai.htm. (access 03/16/2005). 25   http://www.afr-sd.org/CrisisPreparedness/USAIDcode.pdf (access 12/23/2004). USAID has an in-ternal analytical tool (\u2018Conflict Vulnerability Analysis: Issues, Tools and Responses\u2019; July 2000) that could not be procured; it is unclear whether this tool offers a common analytical framework for US actors in this field of engagement. Some speeches by USAID administrators touching on the issue of conflict prevention can be found on the web, they could not easily replace an outright policy. 26   http://www.usaid.gov/pubs/cbj2003/cent_prog/dcha/cmm.html (access 12/23/2004). This again be-comes evident by a speech given by Charles R. Snyder, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Afri-can Affairs, to the Pacific Council on International Policy, November 17, 2003, titled \u201cU.S.-African Partnership of the 21st Century\u201d (www.state.gov/p/af/rls/rm/26772.htm [access 12/23/2004]). 27   http://www.state.gov/m/rm/rls/dosstrat/2004/23503.htm (access 03/01/2005). Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  23 ploit and exacerbate tensions. Stable relations among states also can be threatened by changes in their relative wealth, power, and ambitions.\u201d28 Although the official papers portrays the US focus on conflict resolution and regional stabil-ity, the real impetus of Washington stays clear: In the early years of this Millennium, the US policy towards Africa remains defined by exogenous factors. Africa\u2019s place in US policy re-mains distant and marginalized. However, Africa has gained strategic importance for the US simply because of its oil reserves, and Africa is critical to the American war on terrorism.29 Africa\u2019s conflicts aren\u2019t ignored, but the attention they get, are framed by Washington\u2019s war on terrorism. The \u201cStrategic Plan for FY 2004-2009\u201d emphasizes that development assistance \u201cmust be fully aligned with U.S. foreign policy\u201d. The plan leaves no doubts, that the US\u2019s own security has the highest priority in relation to Africa. This policy rewards friends and allies of the US while other African states have to cope with less and less financial support from the US.30 This suggests that a sober conflict analysis quickly shifts to the background when short-term \u201cnational interests\u201d dominate the decision-making process.  4.8. France France can be regarded as the nation-state in Europe with the best information network, in-fluence and interests in security matters on the African continent. However, the paradigm of conflict prevention was never very prominent in Paris.                                                        28   http://www.state.gov/m/rm/rls/dosstrat/2004/23503.htm (access 12/23/2004). 29   See speech given by Edward Royce, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa of the Committee on International Relations, House of Representatives (US Government 2001). 30   In June 2003, Washington announced the East African Counterterrorism Initative (EACTI), aimed at increasing regional counterterrorism capacities. A package of $ 100 million was allocated to this initiative over a period of 15 months. In the same period the US got involved in the Sahel-zone (Mali, Mauritania, Chad, Niger) with its military assistance programme Pan Sahel Initiative (PSI). The PSI was designed to combat smuggling, international crime and terrorism, to improve boarder control- and combat capacities, and to serve as a buffer zone between the Maghreb and sub-Saharan Africa. In 2004 the Department of State funded the $ 7,75 million initiative with its peace keeping funds. However, the emphasis of both regional initiatives are on \u2018offensive cooperation\u2019 and have no intention of structural crises prevention. EACTI and PSI are indicatives of the impor-tance the US attributes to counterterrorism in comparison to other aims of its Africa policy (e.g. the new ACOTA programme received $ 10 million for 2002). The regional integration of security forces in a boundless war on terror claims role-model character for the US: Washington can abandon long-term deployment of its own military forces (Bachmann 2004: 4). The US initiatives within the scope of the G8 Action plan makes another hint in that direction. At the G8-summit on Sea Island (June 2004) the U.S. announced it would develop a new, five years, $ 600 million international peace initiative to help train and equip foreign forces for peace keeping missions (75.000 troops). The funding for the largely at Africa aimed \u2018Global Peace Operations Initative\u2019 (GPOI) was secured for 2005, but it is unlikely that the Congress will give transfer authority next year (CRS Report for Congress 2005, United States Institute for Peace 2004, and http://www.effectivepeacekeeping.org/ docs/Jan05-GPOI-update.pdf (access 02/02/2005). Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  24 There is no freely available French policy paper on the causes of violent conflict in Africa \u2013 for a long period of time only some relevant speeches by former Ministers Josselin and V\u00e9drine could be found on the home-page of the Quay d\u2019Orsay. However, the Neo-Gaullist foreign minister de Villepin has made crisis response in Africa one of his corner-stones of France\u2019s foreign policy after the intervention in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (November 2002). In a speech at the \u201dInstitut des hautes Etudes de D\u00e9fense Nationale\u201d in June 13, 2003 he once again stressed military and reactive aspects of French policy, while he noted in a highly unspeci-fied way: \u201dThe relaunch of the development effort remains an essential condition for the re-turn to peace.\u201d31 This could suggest different things: a refusal to simplify or to conceptualise what is largely a situational policy, hidden agendas or simply a gap in paradigm reception. The government\u2019s strategies to counter violent conflict referred to in those speeches is evidently most con-cerned with crisis reaction (African peace-keeping/\u2019Recamp\u2019), and not with structural conflict prevention. Although France \u201cwants not just to act in response to the crises, but be more effective in pre-venting and resolving them by defining a joint approach\u201d32, there is wide discrepancy be-tween rhetoric and action in Paris\u2019 policies towards the continent (Kroslak 2004: 80). Once more, recent initiatives show that France focuses its efforts on post-conflict activities in con-trast to the expressed political will to replace a \u2018thinking exclusively geared to short-term efficacy by a vision, by more foresight\u2019.33 The recent violent crises in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Togo \u2013 both harmful to French interests, but apparently not expected in Paris \u2013 suggest that the ana-lytical capacities with regard to conflict prevention are limited.  4.9. Germany Finally, Germany is only starting to consider itself a global foreign policy player, Berlin would not regard its own policy towards Africa as particularly important. However, when taking all financial contributions in multilateral frameworks into account, Germany remains an important actor. German conflict prevention in the 1990s remained an idea in search of a strategy (Matthies 1999, Thiel 2000), but since the beginning of the new millennium this                                                       31   http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/actu/article.gb.asp?ART=35387 (access 12/22/2004). 32   President Chirac at the \u201cTwenty-second Summit of the Heads of State of Africa and France.

Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  25 statement is no longer tenable. Rhetorically, conflict (or crisis) prevention has become one of the most important objectives of its Africa policy (Matthies 2004: 153, Mehler 2002a).34 And with regard to the \u2018Comprehensive Concept of the Federal Government on Civilian Crisis Prevention, Conflict Resolution and Post-Conflict Peace-Building\u2019 (April 2000), the \u2018Action Plan Civilian Crisis Prevention, Conflict Resolution and Post-Conflict Peace-Building\u2019 (May 2004) and the establishment of the sector program on crisis prevention and conflict manage-ment from the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) on behalf of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),35 one has to acknowl-edge: contrary to Paris and Washington, the German government made big efforts to formal-ize its conflict prevention policy. Additionally, the BMZ has sharpened the focus on preven-tion in its planning procedures by using an extensive set of crisis indicators (catalogue for crisis indicators) designed to detect the need for preventive measures early on, so that pro-grammes and project portfolios can be adapted to these needs (Spelten 2004: 172 f.).36 Berlin has made crisis prevention a guideline for, and a task that involves all fields of, na-tional policy. But, although progress in the German conflict prevention policy can be de-tected, the Government still lacks to meet its own claim in terms of practical and conceptual implementation. In its more general (not Africa-specific) policy paper on conflict prevention, the government adopts a distinction of structural and procedural conflict causes (without naming them).37 In                                                       34   The renewed red-green coalition agreement of October 2002 emphasises conflict prevention as one major objective of German development assistance (www.bundesregierung.de/Regierung/ Koalitionsvertrag-I.-Praeambel-,1766/IX.-Gerechte-Globalisierung-De.htm ; access 03/14/2005). 35   The sector program should develop concepts and instruments for implementation in focus coun-tries. This sector program was very active and commissioned numerous studies on a broad range of subjects related to conflict. 36  With the establishment of the Civil Peace Service (CPS; (Ziviler Friedensdienst: ZFD) in 1999 a completely new instrument was created. Furthermore the Government has established the Zen-trum f\u00fcr Internationale Friedenseins\u00e4tze (ZIF). Both ZIF and ZFD provide further education and training on conflict prevention so that appropriately trained and qualified experts can be deployed to assist groups, communities and governments in conflict to develop their capacities to handle conflicts non-violently  (Fleischmann 2004, Plattform Zivile Konfliktbearbeitung 2002, Plattfrom Zivile Konfliktbearbeitung 2003). Within the framework of the Working Group on Development and Peace (FriEnt), the Government, church and non-state executing agencies and political founda-tions are intensifying exchange, discussing concrete conceptual and methodological developments and exploring possibilities for improving mutual consultation, cooperation and coordination. Ac-knowledging the fact, that a multi-dimensional approach is essential to counter the challenges by implementing durable peace, FriEnt is an instrument of addressing the problems of multi-layered cooperation between ministries and departments of very different institutions. But cooperation at working level, especially between ministries, is insufficient (Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norway) 2004: 40). 37   Comprehensive Concept of the Federal Government on Civilian Crisis Prevention, Conflict Resolu-tion and Post-Conflict Peace-Building (updated in December 2002); http://www.auswaertiges-Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  26 its \u2018Africa concept\u2019 the Foreign office vaguely names the erosion of the state from within due to HIV/AIDS, natural disasters, demographic pressure and artificial boundaries as well as politics of identity as parts of the conflict potential in Africa.38 Another paper cites  \u201cpoverty and economic stagnation or even regression, gross inequalities, political oppression and systematic discrimination of minorities, the arbitrary use of power and anarchy, intoler-ance and ignorance, the lack of structures based on the rule of law, free media and a strong civil society\u201d  as structural conflict causes.39 A policy paper on conflict prevention by the ministry of coop-eration does not analyse conflict causes, but in its programmatic part it emphasises human rights, social justice, rule of law, participatory decision-making, protection of natural re-sources, opportunities for development and mechanisms for the peaceful resolution of con-flicts as essential categories. Implicitly, their absence or violation could be regarded as the conflict causes identified by the ministry. More implicit judgements are contained in expla-nations on the German contribution to the Joint Africa/G8 Plan to enhance African capabili-ties to undertake peace support operations, adopted at the G8-summit in Evian.40 Further bits and pieces are thereby added to form a still incoherent German policy towards conflicts in Africa. The \u2018Action Plan Civilian Crisis Prevention, Conflict Resolution and Post-Conflict Peace-Building\u2019 (May 2004) stresses the need to establish stable state structures (rule of law, de-mocracy, human rights and security), to create the potential for peace within civil society, the media, cultural affairs and education, further to safeguard people\u2019s opportunities in life by taking appropriate measures in the fields of business, society and the environment. Hence the German peace building concept focuses on the traditional development category of socio-economic assistance (including return of refugees and IDPs) and support for the political framework, which is a well-established part of assistance to countries in transition. The broad categories of security and reconciliation receive less emphasis.41 Although Berlin wants to eliminate the structural causes of conflicts, a detailed description of conflict-causes is still nowhere to be found. Insufficiently the plan states, \u201carmed conflicts are                                                                                                                                                                       amt.de/www/en/aussenpolitik/friedenspolitik/ziv_km/konfliktpraev_html. (access 01/11/2005). The Comprehensive Concept points out, that poverty alleviation is key for laying the foundations for avoiding violent conflict.  38   See http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/www/de/infoservice/download/pdf/dokumente/afrika_strategie.pdf. 39   See Foreign office home-page entry \u2018Crisis prevention and management as German foreign policy objectives\u2018 (April 2002); http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/www/en/aussenpolitik/friedenspolitik/ ziv_km/konfliktpraev-1_html (access 01/11/2005). 40   http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/www/de/infoservice/download/pdf/friedenspolitik/g8/konfliktbewaeltigung _afrika_2003.pdf (access 01/11/2005). 41   Compared to other international actors, Germany stands out for doing rather little in the security dimension. Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  27 both the result and the cause of serious political, social, economic and environmental mis-management.\u201d42  The afore mentioned \u2018Utstein Study\u2019 points out, that there exists no common understanding and interpretations/perceptions of peace building as a method, concept or approach among the German actors of development cooperation. In the German context there are no common criteria to distinguish between peace building activities and measures that address conflict directly, and those that address conflict indirectly (Ministry of Foreign Affairs [Norway] 2004). The national Utstein report by the GTZ identifies both conceptual confusion and a very variable degree of strategic consistency and thinking in project planning and country portfolios (GTZ 2003: 19-21, 25). Due to these deficiencies, one essential element is the objec-tive to increase the coherence of crisis prevention measures within the Federal Government. The Government has set up an \u2018Interministerial Steering Group for Civilian Crisis Preven-tion\u2019 (September 2004) in order to anchor crisis prevention as a cross-sectoral task in the overall policy of the Federal Government.43  In sum, evidence of growing professionalism in the handling of peace and conflict issues since the mid-1990s, with a further strengthening since 2000, can be detected. New fields of action and also new instruments were established. But while many strategies and experi-ences are already available for post-conflict reconstruction, there is still a disturbing lack of know-how and experience available for true crisis prevention. At present, many project planning documents frequently make only passing reference to conflict as an issue. The process of adapting country portfolios to reflect new priorities after the comprehensive con-cept was laid out is not yet completed. Taken all together the picture of the various conceptual starting points of conflict prevention policies by major bilateral and multilateral donors is bewildering. More general policies (poverty reduction!) and already existing tools might influence the analysis of conflict, which is hardly intellectually acceptable. What the long list of potential conflict causes suggests, is that:  1.  There is no consensus on conflict causes between bilateral donors and influential multinational organisations; 2.  There is not necessarily even a consensus between different ministries or departments of the same government/organisation;                                                       42   Die Bundesregierung (2004) 7 (English Version). 43   Taking the British Global Conflict Prevention Pool and the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool as role models, the German Government wants to adopt this British model and to verify, if a pilot scheme can be implemented (M\u00fcller 2005: 9). Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  28 3.  There is much confusion in the use of conflict types and indicators and therefore doubts are permitted as to the effectiveness or existence of an overall analytical framework; 4.  The specification of conflict causes evolves over time\u2013 there is obviously a need to adapt policy to new insights. However, it is never clear if a new set of \u2018official\u2019 con-flict causes is the result of analytical progress. Changes in policies are not even com-mented. 5.  The conflict causes singled out in some instances fit the policy of single actors; with the World Bank putting forward socio-economic factors and waving a strong pro-government bias (its partners are predominantly African governments). The British concern with collapsing states and lack of mechanisms for conflict management is in line with a pronounced readiness to intervene even militarily (Sierra Leone); etc. However, the analysis is not always in line with the responses offered. What is striking is the multiple and prominent reference to poverty as a cause of (or poverty reduction as a solution to) African conflicts; this seems to be the smallest common denomina-tor for many actors involved in African affairs. African voices heard in this context stress this point as well.44 However, poverty reduction as a core paradigm in donor relations towards Africa clearly needs a more political focus to become a conflict preventive policy. According to the author of a recent study, a closer look at the relationship between both objectives is necessary  \u201cCurrent policy thinking (...) tends to be underpinned by the assumption that \u2018poverty\u2019 and \u2018social exclusion\u2019 cause conflict. Poverty eradication is then justified as a form of conflict pre-vention. The relationship, however, is more complex and hence needs refinement. Conflict is as much a consequence of development as it is a constraint on development\u201d (Verstegen 2001: 5).  This quotation should warn against simplistic approaches. The tendency to pick segments of conflict causes might be explained best by the preponderance of narrow departmental inter-ests. Contradictions of sectoral donor policies can easily be found. The absence of a compre-hensive view on conflict and peace including the acknowledgement of the inter-relatedness of conflict dynamics with own activities leads the international community into a situation where conflict preventive effects take place only at random. While the debate in humanitar-ian assistance (Anderson 1999) has achieved a certain standard, e.g. automatically taking negative effects of own actions into account, this did not happen yet for the bulk of devel-                                                      44   The New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development initiative (NEPAD; October 2001) by African Lead-ers also offers a strange understanding of conflict: According to the document that contains a \u2018Peace and Security Initiative\u2019 African states are just \u2018vulnerable\u2019 to conflict, conflict causes are no-where explicitly stated (para 73). Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  29 opmental action, where unintended consequences are still rarely under scrutiny let alone conceptually incorporated in project designs.  5. Conclusions and Perspectives Resuming chapter 2, 3 and 4, we can assert that practice and academia are faced with four major forms of misinterpretations of violent conflicts in Africa \u2013 potentially leading to erro-neous policies: 1.  Oversimplification (frequently: poverty as prime cause of conflict) 2.  Lack of focus (unsystematic addition of conflict causes) 3.  Lack of conceptual clarity (no distinction between different types of conflict factors) 4.  State-centrism (Lack of concern for transnational phenomena, and non-state actors).45 Additionally, the lack of a vision of what would be the prerequisites for a peaceful society is becoming clearer every day.46 However, an outspoken critic of the new agenda between con-flict prevention and resolution warns that \u2018liberal peace\u2019 as he calls the concept would reflect \u2018a radical developmental agenda of social transformation\u2019 (Duffield 2001: 11). There is indeed a heavy dose of presumptuousness when westerners draw up ideal societies for Africans. In fact, policy-makers and academics from North and South need to discuss more openly what they are aiming at. In the absence of that discussion actors should have at least some guiding principles for understanding the challenges they are facing.  Is there something like a well-suited, maybe even Africa-specific analytical framework? A first response might be that it would be hazardous to simplify a complex picture, \u2018Africa\u2019 might not offer an appropriate level of generalisation. Anyhow, broader approaches integrat-ing structural conflict factors including state failure, flawed democratisation, inefficient insti-tutions, politics of identity, competition for scarce or precious resources as well as the trau-                                                      45   Reno (2001: 198) challenges \u2018the international expectation that all Africans live within political units that at least resemble states\u2019. A sharp critique on Reno, Chabal and Daloz (1999), and others is of-fered by Joseph (2002). 46   The academic literature on causes of conflict frequently names the absence of democracy as a main factor for uncivil societies \u2013 and rightly so. However, the linkage is more complicated. Although democracy might make violence unnecessary it is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for domestic peace. Stable autocratic regimes might be more capable in preventing violent internal conflicts than unstable democracies, especially in least developed countries after conflict. Being more liberal than dictatorships, democratic societies encourage dissent but might not be responsive enough to concede substantive demands. Therefore social groups resort to unconstitutional chan-nels and violent means to show their discontent. Political change can compound the problem fur-ther. Specifically the process of democratisation rarely occurs smoothly and in linear fashion. The effectiveness in preventing violent means may not be given by these (fragile) new democracies with regard to weakness in the specific institutional design (see Burnell 2004). Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  30 matic experiences and structural consequences of colonial rule and war offer a better analyti-cal framework than one-dimensional explanations.47  Since both spheres are more (practitioners) or less (researchers) infected by the above-mentioned common misinterpretations of conflict, it could be useful to find a common way out of it. Here, the policy-sphere has to offer a valid formula, that still needs to be refined, tested and specified for different arenas and policies: the leitmotif of \u2018structural stability\u2019 which has been adopted in 1997 by the OECD DAC, but has unfortunately remained a \u2018sec-ond-rank\u2019 concept. The definition given by the EU is broad enough to cover most of the con-cerns developed above: \u201cStructural stability is to be understood as a term denoting a dynamic situation, a situation of stability able to cope with the dynamics inherent in (emerging) democratic societies. Struc-tural stability could thus be defined as a situation involving sustainable economic develop-ment, democracy and respect for human rights, viable political structures, and healthy social and environmental conditions, with the capacity to manage change without to resort to violent conflict.\u201d (European Commission 1996). When carefully developed, the argument contained in this definition and the slightly differ-ent one offered by the OECD DAC leads to an understanding of structural stability as a \u2018peace order\u2019 with seven building blocks (Mehler 2002b): -  Economy: sustainable economic growth -  Ecology: environmental security -  Society: social justice -  Politics 1: viable political (and administrative) structures -  Politics 2: democracy (including transfer of power by elections) -  Politics 3: rule of law and human rights -  Politics 4: inclusion of major identity and elite groups. One core assumption is that all these elements are explicitly inter-linked and mutually rein-forcing. The reverse picture of \u2018structural instability\u2019 can be easily derived from that list (so-cial injustice, absence of democracy, exclusion, etc.). Here as well, the \u2018building blocks\u2019 are inter-linked and together form a \u2018conflict order\u2019 \u2013 they might represent a set of appropriate \u2018root causes\u2019 of conflict. Other conflict factor-types (aggravating factors, prolonging factors, triggers) could then be easily derived. To draw on structural stability for the development of an appropriate analytical framework for African conflicts has one additional advantage: the term itself exists for some years (even longer in natural sciences!) and it has received accep-tance in the framework of the OECD DAC.                                                        47   Deng 1996; a systematic view is presented by Engel and Mehler 2000. Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  31 What is even more relevant is the possibility to escape apodictic judgements about the viabil-ity of states and societies of the whole continent. The drawing up of \u2018profiles\u2019 of structural stability/instability would reveal that there are distinct and variable shortcomings or poten-tials in different building-blocks of structural stability for varying African states or societies.  One major shortcoming of this approach is its focus on structure. It needs to be comple-mented by an analysis of actors and behaviour. Focusing on agency and thereby taking into account the strategies, motives and behaviour of local stakeholders should not be portrayed as an alternative to structural approaches, but rather as a complementary (second) step in analysis.48  One of the major flaws in the way conflict prevention is put into practice currently is to re-main very state-focused, while we know that conflicts develop frequently locally and then easily cross existing borders becoming an issue for sub-regional organisations. Conflicts are not confined to the territory of a (increasingly fictitious) nation-state, a growing \u2018transnation-alism\u2019 is associated with contemporary violent conflict (Engel/Mehler 2005). The weakness of state structures is an established feature very familiar to African citizens in a sizeable propor-tion of the continent. The discussion on the use of cooperation with \u2018rotten\u2019 or under-performing state structures has been engaged in development cooperation for some time now, it is unavoidable in respect to crisis prevention: On the one hand the state (or the judi-ciary system or the security apparatus) failed to function in resolving/managing conflicts in several cases, but on the other hand development cooperation risks to contribute to its fur-ther degradation, if it is only cooperating with some traditional leaders or the civil society (Debiel et al. 2005). But it is clear that problems and solutions can be found on two other lev-els than the nation-state: on the local and the border-transcending sub-regional level.  This might best be exemplified by focusing on the security sector: In West Africa\u2019s major war zone spreading now from Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire conflict has its local roots, but its trans-border dynamics. There are local \u2018violence actors\u2019 ranging from tra-ditional hunters to armed students movements as well as international \u2018violence actors\u2019 rang-ing from ECOWAS peace-keepers to armed refugees hired by the parties in conflict. They might be as important as the state actors but receive little analytical attention. An answer to this challenge may reside in the building of a \u2018sub-regional security architecture\u2019 which would necessitate a conscious networking between public, private and local security forces.49                                                       48  Some valuable work has recently been offered from this perspective \u2013 again mainly on material motivations (e.g. Jean/Rufin 1996; Herbst 2000, Berdal/Malone 2000). There might be a need to map violence actors as well according to their protective capacities in the sense of emerging oligopolies of violence (Mehler 2004). 49   Shearing and Kempa 2000. Some more ideas explaining why such an approach has its merits can be found in de Waal (2002). Mehler: Major Flaws in Conflict Prevention Policies towards Africa  32 The delimitation of responsibilities between those forces is crucial. In their current form of co-existence, vigilantes and other violent actors are probably inimical to democracy and therefore structural stability (Baker 2002). Of course there will be conflicts of competence between central and local actors, but this is exactly why the issue must be addressed in a conscious manner. Recognition of those non-public actors could be a formal and explicit one, following clear criteria and including the obligation to respect human rights, a kind of certi-fication rather than a gratification scheme.  The argumentation of this paper offers a divergent reading and deducts lessons for a more realistic conflict prevention policy towards Africa. The holistic view on a society\u2019s capacity of living in peace with itself and its neighbours \u2013 inherent in the notion of structural stability \u2013 offers a framework for analysis and action as well as a basis of discussion between donors and recipients of development aid (Lock 2002). A parallel enlargement of the focus of atten-tion from the national towards the local and the sub-regional level is the appropriate answer to the declining, while still existing importance of the nation-state in war-torn parts of Africa. The identification of escalation patterns and a clear conceptual distinction between conflict sustaining/prolonging factors and \u2018root causes\u2019 of conflict are important for correct analyses (academics) and efficient strategies (practitioners). Finally, there is a wide gap in the under-standing of conflict causes between different actors involved in conflict prevention policies that should be overcome by frank exchanges of viewpoints.  There is every reason to believe that an increasing number of African countries will face vio-lent conflict in the decades to come. Therefore, it would be helpful if more African policy-makers, aid bureaucracies and researchers would be familiar with appropriate approaches of conflict analysis and with adequate designs of a stable peace order.
