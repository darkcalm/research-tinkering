INTRODUCTION\nThe past decade has witnessed a proliferation of connected\ndevices and objects, where the notion of Internet-of-Things\n(IoT) plays a central role in the envisioned technological\nadvances. Conceptually speaking, IoT foresees an intelligent\nnetwork infrastructure with ubiquitous smart devices - home\nautomation, interactive healthcare, and self-driving connected\nvehicles, are typical in IoT [7], [104]; see Fig. 1. Today, a\nnumber of IoT applications have already brought major benefits\nto many aspects of our daily life. The current generation\nof IoT can already afford an increasing amount of real-time\nThe work of T. Chen and G. B. Giannakis was supported by NSF 1509040,\n1508993, and 1711471. The work of S.

However, despite the popularity of IoT, several\ncritical challenges must be addressed before embracing its\nfull potential [5], [86]. To this end, we highlight three key\nchallenges that are arguably expected to be at the epicenter of\nemerging IoT research fields.\nFig. 1:Internet of Everything[3].\nExtreme heterogeneity.\nThe computational and\ncommunication capacities of\nconnected devices differ due\nto differences in hardware\n(e.g., CPU frequency),\ncommunication protocol\n(e.g., ZigBee, WiFi), and\nenergy availability (e.g.,\nbattery level) [103]. The\ntasks carried out on various\ndevices are often considerably diverse, e.g., motion sensors\nmonitor human behavior in a smart home [60], while cameras\nare responsible for recognizing a suspicious behavior in a\ncrowded environment, or, vehicle plates in a parking garage.\nUnpredictable dynamics. Unlike many existing communica-\ntion, computing and networking platforms, the IoT dynam-\nics can stem from multiple sources, where adaptivity is not\nonly critical but also essential in designing hardware and\nmanagement protocols. Such sources entail human-in-the-loop\ndynamics in addition to physical objects [60], demand response\nin energy systems [40], and intelligent automotive applications\n[59]. In these applications, IoT dynamics are intertwined with\nor even partially determined by human behavior [34], [69],\n[73] - as such, high degree of adaptivity in the algorithm and\nhardware design is needed.\nScalability at the core. IoT entails an intelligent network\ninfrastructure with a massive number of devices. It is estimated\nthat by 2020, there will be more than 50 billion devices con-\nnected through the Internet [39], which highlights scalability as\na key challenge for IoT [7], [86]. Scalability is not only about\ncomputational efficiency, but also about lower communication\noverhead (e.g., how often a device needs to communicate\nwith the remote cloud center), as well as reduced information\nneeded (e.g., what type of information a device needs before\nmaking sensible decisions).\nFaced with these major IoT challenges, innovations in net-\nwork design and management are desired to enable efficient\nonline operations, and seamless co-existence of humans with\nthings [25]. Consequently, it is imperative to develop new tools\nfor IoT management that tap into diverse inference, signal\nprocessing, communications, and networking techniques, by\ndrawing from fields such as machine learning, optimization,\nar\nX\niv\n:1\n81\n0.\n11\n61\n3v\n1 \n [c\ns.S\nY]\n  2\n7 O\nct \n20\n18\n2and applied statistics. The novel expertise gleaned from these\nresearch areas, coupled with the solid analytical approach, are\nthe best credentials for succeeding in IoT research [86].\nFrom a network architecture perspective, to ensure the\ndesired user experience and meet heterogeneous service re-\nquirements, IoT tasks nowadays are no longer only supported\nby the cloud data centers, but also through a promising new\narchitecture termed edge computing, or in a broader sense fog\ncomputing. This architecture distributes computation, commu-\nnication, and storage closer to the end IoT devices and users,\nalong the cloud-to-things continuum [9], [10], [25], [61], [62],\n[94]. This shift of computing paradigms is further promoted\nby the advanced communication techniques emerging with\nstandards such as Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) [2], [4].\nGiven the huge volume of data in various IoT setups and the\nproliferation of learning and large-scale optimization advances,\na pertinent direction is prompted by asking the following\nquestion: Can we learn from historical data to improve the\nquality of network management policies in IoT? The rationale\nis that historical data contain statistics of the IoT environments\n[93], and learning from them can mitigate the uncertainty of\nfuture management tasks. Further armed with online adaptation\ncapability to reinforce the current policies, it is envisioned that\nlearn-and-adapt network management schemes can markedly\nimprove IoT user experience in terms of low service delay, high\nsystem resilience, and adaptivity [17], [21]. Toward this goal,\nthe present overview paper will outline an offline-aided online\napproach with markedly improved performance, by leveraging\nstatistical learning from historical samples.\nTaking a step further, online learning, with online con-\nvex optimization (OCO) as a special case, is an emerging\nmethodology for sequential decision making with light-weight\nimplementation and well documented merits, especially when\nthe environment (e.g., a sequence of convex costs) varies in\nan unknown and possibly adversarial manner [15], [109]. Tar-\ngeting a scalable solution in a prohibitively complex IoT envi-\nronment, this paper will also overview a new OCO framework\ndesigned for IoT, which further incorporates various forms of\nfeedback, physical constraints and performance metrics driven\nby IoT applications, relative to the standard settings [15],\n[43], [109]. Novel schemes tailored for this setting can lay\na solid analytical foundation to delineate the tradeoffs among\nalgorithm scalability, performance guarantees, and degree of\n(non-)stationarity present in the IoT environment [16], [19].\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II\ndeals with the heterogeneity in IoT demand and QoS, along\nwith a unified formulation for dynamic IoT tasks. Section\nIII introduces methods for optimizing IoT performance under\ndifferent level of non-stationarity in IoT dynamics. Section\nIV summarizes scalable OCO-based schemes with different\nfeedback options. Finally, concluding remarks and possible\nfuture research directions are highlighted in Section V.\nNotation.

HETEROGENEITY IN IOT DEMAND AND QOS\nHeterogeneity is inherent in IoT, and it manifests itself across\ndifferent aspects, from application requirements and constraints\nto sensing and communication technologies.\nA. Heterogeneous applications\nThe range of IoT applications already spans several fields,\nand it is rapidly increasing. A few examples of applications\nare [4], [5], [104]: (i) lifestyles (wearable gadgets, gam-\ning, augmented/virtual reality, wellness); (ii) smart environ-\nments (homes, offices, cities); (iii) automotive (self-driving,\ntraffic monitoring, intelligent transportation systems, vehicle-\nto-vehicle communications); (iv) industrial (full automation\nand control, structure monitoring, logistic); (v) environmental\nmonitoring (pollution, global warming, waste management);\n(vi) healthcare (patient monitoring, body area networks, smart\nhealth, elderly care); and, (vii) security and surveillance. These\napplications are characterized by highly diverse requirements,\nin terms of data rate, latency, reliability, security, connectivity,\nmobility, etc. To illustrate the extreme variability of require-\nments, we note that virtual reality require latencies in the order\nof a few milliseconds and data rates in the order of 25 Mbps,\nwhile automated driving or certain industrial control applica-\ntions require latencies in the order of milliseconds and high\npacket transmission reliability (in the order of 99.999 percent).\nConversely, for environmental monitoring applications such as\nwaste management, an update frequency of one packet/hour is\nsufficient, with a tolerable delay of 30 minutes.\nA few paradigms are useful to outline the challenges facing\nIoT, and the potential of our approaches to addressing them.\nAutomated driving. The goal in this application is to enhance\nperception of an individual vehicle and thus improve safety.\nA common approach is to set up a cooperative perception\nsystem building on the information sharing between vehicles\nand roadside units (RSUs) [79]. The scope is to widen the\nvisibility of the individual vehicle to prevent that an object\nunseen by a single vehicle might cause an accident [48], [80].\nThe signals to be exchanged go from (low data rate) range mea-\nsurements to (high data rate) high definition maps generated by\nsensors mounted on each vehicle. The communication channels\nbetween vehicles are highly dynamic and hard to predict, while\nthe information available at each time slot can be outdated.\nNevertheless, the communication among vehicles and RSUs\nshould be performed in a reliable and timely manner to ensure\nthat emergency operations can take place in the due time.\nIntelligent transportation. A typical task in this application\nis to navigate a set of electric vehicles to their destination,\nby collecting along the way data about traffic, state of the\nbattery, and availability of parking slots. The objective here is\nto minimize fuel consumption and the time needed to reach\na certain destination, while ensuring that all vehicles find a\nproper refueling station for their batteries along the way. The\n3remaining time to destination is updated online, depending on\nthe time-varying traffic state, which is generally unpredictable.\nB. Heterogeneous technologies\nThe IoT ecosystem is composed of various components,\nwhose functionality falls within the following categories [5]:\nidentification, sensing, communication, computation, and ser-\nvices. Identification is crucial to assign a clear identity to each\nobject in the network. The role of sensing elements is to gather\ndata from the real world. Typically, sensors are integrated\nwith single board computers and TCP/IP functionalities to\ncreate IoT devices, such as Arduino or Raspberry PI, which\nare able to sense and send data to a decision entity. The\nrole of communication is to propagate information from the\nsensing elements to a decision entity, possibly distributed, and\nback to actuators. There is a plethora of very heterogeneous\ncommunication technologies that are in use in IoT. As a\nbroad classification, we can list: (i) short-range technologies to\nsupport machine-to-machine communications, like Bluetooth,\nIEEE 802.15.4 and ZigBee; (ii) long-range networks, like LoRa\nsupporting data rates of around 50 kbps over ranges up to 15\nKm, or SigFox using ultra-narrowband technologies to support\nultra-low power consumption and long ranges (up to 30-50\nKm in rural areas, 3-10 Km in urban areas), at the expenses\nof limited data rates; (iii) Low-power Wi-Fi, also called\nIEEE 802.11ah supporting data rates up to 347 Mbps; and,\n(iv) cellular networks. Current 4G cellular technologies, more\nspecifically the 3rd Generation Partnership Project Long-Term\nEvolution (3GPP LTE), represent the state-of-the art in mobile\ncommunications. However, LTE has been primarily designed\nfor broadband communications, and thus not optimized for the\nmachine-type communications (MTC) envisioned in IoT.\nTo partially overcome this discrepancy, 3GPP has introduced\nsome modifications to the standards to enable the deployment\nof massive smart connected devices and services such as those\nin smart cities or smart grids: eMTC [1] and NB-IoT [2]. But\na truly disruptive framework enabling an effective deployment\nof IoT is 5G communication networks, thanks to increased\ndata rate, reduced end-to-end latency, and improved coverage\nrelative to 4G [74]. The key features of 5G that are particularly\nsuitable for IoT are: (i) the integration of heterogeneous access\ntechnologies; (ii) virtualization of network functionalities; and,\n(iii) bringing cloud functionalities close to the end-user by\nintroducing mobile edge computing (MEC). While earlier\nnetwork generations have been designed as general purpose\nconnectivity platforms, the vision underlying 5G is to create\nan ecosystem for technical and business innovations involving\nvertical markets such as automotive, energy, agriculture, city\nmanagement, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation.\nSince these services have very different requirements and\nconstraints, the key challenge of 5G is to design a single\nplatform being able to serve different purposes in an efficient\nway. The solution to tackle such a challenging question is\nnetwork slicing. At the basis of network slicing, there is\nnetwork function virtualization, which makes it possible to par-\ntition a single physical network into multiple virtual networks,\neach matched to its specific requirements and constraints.\nThis enables operators to provide networks on an as-a-service\nbasis, while meeting a wide range of use cases in parallel.\nVirtualization is going to play a key role also in IoT to\ncope with high heterogeneity of requirements as well as the\ncapabilities of devices. But being able to meet the stringent\nlatency requirements of IoT applications, virtualization needs\nto be coupled with a new architectural vision, enabled by MEC.\nC. Embedding IoT in the edge cloud\nEven within the sophisticated architecture of 5G networks,\nmeeting the stringent latency constraints required in some IoT\napplications over a wide area network can be still challenging,\nif not impossible. To guarantee low latencies, a popular solution\nis to bring cloud functionalities close to the end users through\nmobile (or multi-access) edge computing [44], [56].\nWith MEC, computation and storage resources are brought\nat the edge of the network, represented by the network access\npoints. In this way, delay-sensitive applications launched by\na mobile device can be offloaded to the nearest mobile edge\nhost (MEH), and the most popular contents can also be cached\nin MEHs to minimize downloading time [26], [27]. Bringing\ncomputation and storage resources at the edge of the network\nmakes it possible to guarantee low and stable delays. In\npractice, the applications launched by the user are executed\nby virtual machines running on nearby edge nodes, either\ncloudlets, exploiting a Wi-Fi connection [29], [49], or MEHs,\nusing cellular communication technologies [10]. The further\nextension of MEC is fog computing, where the edge of the\nnetwork can include devices as well, thus creating a continuum\nof devices able to sense, communicate and compute [12],\n[25]. A critical aspect in this scenario is mobility management\n[89]. To handle mobility while offering a seamless service\ncontinuity, it is necessary to migrate virtual machines quickly\nacross MEH. This is a critical step, because instantiating a\nconventional virtual machine can take times well beyond the\nlatencies required in some IoT applications.\nIn MEC or fog computing settings, communication, com-\nputation and storage resources can be seen as three aspects\nof a single system. From a user-centric perspective, what\nactually matters is the time needed to launch an application\nand receive the result back. The overall delay depends on\ncommunication time, computation time and the distribution of\ncontents across the network. This holistic vision calls for a joint\ndynamic optimization of communication, computation, and\ncaching resources [9]. An application where communication\nand computation resources are closely mingled is computation\noffloading. This is a fundamental mechanism to enable simple\ndevices to run sophisticated applications or to allow battery-\npowered devices to run their applications remotely to save en-\nergy and thus prolong battery lifetime. Computation offloading\nhas gained growing popularity recently. For single-user MEC,\nit has been studied in [50], [57], [61], [64]. The multi-user case\nwas addressed in [24], [82], and later extended to the dynamic\ncase, using stochastic optimization in [65], [81]. See recent\nsurveys [9], [10], [63] and references therein.\nD. Taming heterogeneity via a unified formulation\nWith various applications and technologies in mind, the goal\n4optimize\n{xt,\u2200t}\nT\u2211\nt=1\nf(xt; st) /IoT performance metrics\nsubject to\nT\u2211\nt=1\ng(xt; st) \u2264 0 /IoT long-term requirements\nxt \u2208 X (st), \u2200t /IoT short-term requirements\nPer slot t, IoT state dynamics st+1 = d(st,xt, \u03bet)\nPer slot t, find xt given information oracle Ot\n(1a)\n(1b)\n(1c)\n(1d)\n(1e)\nof this section is to put forth a unified model for IoT tasks that\nwill guide subsequent algorithmic development.\nUnifying models. Consider discrete time t \u2208 N, and a time\nhorizon of T slots. Per slot t, an IoT state variable st \u2208 Rp\nis defined, which characterizes all the critical parameters of\nthe IoT environment. Assuming certain amount of knowledge\nabout the environment, the IoT operator will make a decision\nxt \u2208 Rd, aiming to optimize task-specific performance, subject\nto different types of constraints. The decision xt can in turn\ndrive the next state st+1. To model such decision making pro-\ncesses, we consider a generic problem (1). The model here is\ngeneral. The slot duration can vary from tens of microseconds\nin wireless networks, a few milliseconds in automated driving,\ntens of seconds in intelligent transportation, to minutes or even\nhours in smart power networks; the state st can represent\nthe channel gain in wireless networks, the congestion level\nin data networks as well as transportation networks, and the\nrenewable generation, and energy prices in power networks;\nand the decision xt can include the transmitted power in\ncommunication, the size of data workloads, the number of\nvehicles, or the amount of energy. Regarding the objectives,\nconstraints and state dynamics in (1), we will highlight their\nIoT relevance, especially of interest to communication and\nnetworking communities.\nPerformance metrics. Given the state st and the decision xt,\nwe consider the IoT performance as a generic time-invariant\nfunction f(xt; st) (use ft(xt) interchangeably) depending on\nthe time-varying quantities st and xt. For MEC problem in\nSection II-C, f(xt; st) often represents the power consumption\naggregating over all devices, the aggregated delay, or the sys-\ntem throughput [10], [19], [94]. Another line of recent research\nstudies a new performance metric in MEC \u2014 age of informa-\ntion or age, which measures the timeliness of system status\nusing the elapsed time since the most recently received packet\nwas generated at its source [47]. Age of information is pertinent\nto mission-critical IoT applications [28], [88]. Furthermore, for\ntraffic assignment tasks in intelligent transportation, ft(xt) can\ncapture the overall fuel consumption, and the travel time of\nvehicles on the road [106]; for demand response in smart grids,\nit is related to user utility and power balancing cost depending\non the real-time energy prices [52], [54], [85], [97]; and for\napplications related to wireless communications, throughput or\nachievable rate also plays a critical role in the objective.\nShort-term constraints. The heterogeneous requirements in\nIoT are modeled via short-term and long-term constraints in\n(1). The short-term constraints are imposed to regulate xt in\naccordance to short-term requirements, which can be collected\nin a compact set X (st) \u2014 that is either continuous or discrete,\nand possibly depends on the IoT state st. As an example,\nconsider a MEC system composed of access points (APs),\nMEC servers, and mobile user equipment (UE). To meet the\nstringent latency requirement, the E2E latency of each UE\nshould be less than l\u00af, that is,\nltxt + l\nbk\nt + l\nexe\nt + l\nrx\nt \u2264 l\u00af (2)\nwhere i) ltxt is the time spent to send the program state and\ninput (encoded with bt bits) from UE to AP, e.g., ltxt = bt/rt,\nwith rt being the data rate (in bits/sec); ii) lbkt is the backhaul\nlatency between AP and MEC server, which appears when\nthe computations are performed in a server that is not co-\nlocated with the AP; iii) lexet is the server execution time\ndefined as lexet = ct/ut, where ct is the number of CPU cycles\nto be executed, and ut is the number of CPU cycles/second\nallocated by the MEC server to UE; and, iv) lrxt is the time\nfor the MEC server to send back the result to UE. With\nxt := {ut, rt} and st := {lbkt , lrxt , ct, bt} thus (2) included\nin X (st), selecting xt \u2208 X (st) guarantees the E2E latency\nrequirement in MEC. Short-term constraints also arise due\nto the physical limits of transmission lines and generators in\npower networks [40], transceivers in wireless communication\n[96], as well as vehicles in transportation networks [106].\nLong-term constraints. In some IoT applications, the short-\nterm constraints cannot accurately characterize the demand and\nrequirements. For the latency requirement in MEC, the short-\nterm constraint (2) makes implicit assumptions that i) no new\ntask is generated before the old tasks are completed; and, ii)\neach single task is carried out within an established time frame.\nThese assumptions may be restrictive in some cases. Consider\nalso a vehicle in the intelligent transportation application that\nmust arrive at its destination within a certain interval. To guar-\nantee on-time arrival, its long-term average speed instead of the\ninstantaneous speed needs to be lower bounded. The long-term\nconstraints are thus well-motivated to allow flexible adaptation\nof xt to temporal variations of service requirements. Given\nthe state st and the decision xt, they are modeled as a set of\npenalty functions g(xt; st) := [g1(xt; st), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , gN (xt; st)]> in\n(1b). Ideally, we want the accumulated penalty over the entire\nhorizon below a certain threshold. For convenience, we let the\nthreshold to be 0 in (1b), which is without loss of generality\nsubject to a constant shift. Long-term constraints also appear in\nwireless networks where often the average transmit power and\nlink capacity are confined [96]. The challenge in dealing with\nlong-term constraints is that the future states st+1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , sT are\nnot known at slot t, which calls for adaptive optimization.\nState dynamics. One of the key challenges in IoT is its\nunpredictable dynamics. In (1), IoT dynamics are encoded\n5TABLE I: An overview of heterogeneous IoT settings considered.\nSection State dynamics st \u2192 st+1 Information oracle Ot\nSection III-A i.i.d. or Markovian f,g,X and {s1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , st}\nSection III-B Partially controlled Markovian f,g,X and {s1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , st}\nSection III-C Controlled Markovian f1(x1),g1(x1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ft\u22121(xt\u22121),gt\u22121(xt\u22121) and {s1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , st}\nSection IV-A Generally non-stationary f1,g1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ft\u22121,gt\u22121,X\nSection IV-B Generally non-stationary f1(x1),g1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ft\u22121(xt\u22121),gt\u22121,X\nSection IV-C Generally non-stationary f1(x1),g1(x1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ft\u22121(xt\u22121),gt\u22121(xt\u22121),X\nby a state transition function d which generates the next\nstate st+1 = d(st,xt, \u03bet) given st and xt as well as an\nexogenous variable \u03bet. In most cases, the exogenous variable\n\u03bet can be a random disturbance. For wireless communication\napplications where the state st represents the fading channel\nstate, then st+1 often does not depend on st and xt; that is,\nst+1 = d(\u03bet) := s\u00af + \u03bet, where s\u00af is the mean channel state,\nand \u03be1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03beT are independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.)\nzero-mean random variables; see e.g., [38], [96]. Markovian\ndynamics are also common in modeling energy prices, renew-\nable generation processes [41], in which case st+1 = d(st, \u03bet)\ndepends on the current state st and an i.i.d. noise \u03bet but not\nxt. We refer to both st+1 = d(\u03bet) and st+1 = d(st, \u03bet), as\nnon-interactive dynamics. The decision xt can also play an\nimportant role in state transitions. Taking MEC as an example,\na queueing model is usually incorporated to keep trace of\nthe relevant quantities, such as the amount of remaining tasks\nthat need to be offloaded or processed. With {bt, ct, rt, ut}\ndefined below (2), we consider a transmission queue qtxt that\nquantifies the number of bits to be transmitted at slot t from\nUE, and a computation queue qexet that quantifies the amount of\ncomputation that needs to be completed for UE. If \u2206t denotes\nthe slot duration, the transmission queue evolves as\nqtxt+1 = max\n[\nqtxt \u2212 rt\u2206t, 0\n]\n+ bt (3)\nand the computation queue evolves as follows qexet+1 =\nmax [qexet \u2212 ut\u2206t, 0] + ct. In this case, the IoT state is\nst := {qtxt , qexet }, the decision is xt := {ut, rt}, and the\nexogenous variable is \u03bet := {bt, ct}. It then follows that\nst+1 = d(st,xt, \u03bet) \u2014 what we term interactive dynamics, or\nmore precisely, controlled Markovian dynamics if \u03bet is i.i.d. If\nthe communication and computation resources are sufficient,\nan ideal policy should guarantee the queue stability [71], [92].\nAccording to Little\u2019s law [77], the average execution delay\nexperienced by each UE is proportional to the average queue\nlengths. Hence, a meaningful problem can be minimizing the\naverage power, subject to the average delay constraints, which\nwill be discussed in Section III-B. State variables of this type\nalso include the location of a vehicle in the intelligent trans-\nportation or an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that depends on\ntheir previous location and the current movement [42], [100],\n[101], and the energy level of a battery that depends on their\ninstantaneous (dis)charging amounts. More complex dynamics\nare also possible in IoT due to e.g., strategic human interactions\nand malicious attack [110]. In those cases, \u03bet can be a function\nof all the states s1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , st, or even completely arbitrary.\nAccessible information. While various objectives, constraints\nand state dynamics have been adopted to model heteroge-\nneous problems in IoT, the level of accessible information\ndirectly affects how to solve the resultant problem given\nlimited communication and computation resources \u2014 the\nepicenter of scalability barriers in IoT. Let the information\noracle Ot collect all the information available to the IoT\noperator before making decision xt. For cases where the\nobjectives and the constraints are easy-to-measure formulas\n(e.g., aggregated power, throughput, distance), we consider\nOt := {f,g,X , s1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , st} that includes the explicit form of\nfunctions {f,g}, set X and one-slot-ahead prediction st. In\nsome IoT settings however, i) the objective capturing user-\ncentric quantities, e.g., service latency or reliability, security\nrisk, and customer ratings, is hard to model; ii) the objective\ninvolving fast-varying quantities is hard to predict, e.g., the\nmillimeter wave links in 5G are prone to blocking events,\nthus hard to predict.; and, iii) even if modeling and predicting\nare possible in theory, the low-power smart devices may not\nafford the complexity of running statistical learning tools \u201con-\nthe-fly.\u201d In such cases, we consider a fully causal information\noracle Ot := {f1(x1),g1(x1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , ft\u22121(xt\u22121),gt\u22121(xt\u22121)}\nthat includes only the observed objective function values and\nconstraint penalties at previous slots. IoT scenarios between\nthese two extreme cases will also be discussed.\nIn Table I, we summarize the heterogeneous settings that\none may encounter in IoT. Targeting these settings, a set of\nsuitable solvers will be discussed in the subsequent sections.\nWhile the methodologies presented in this paper mainly focus\non stochastic optimization and online learning, approaches\nbased on other methodologies such as game theory and robust\noptimization can be also applied to solve similar problems.\nIII. ADAPTIVITY TO DYNAMIC IOT ENVIRONMENTS\nThis section introduces methods for optimizing IoT perfor-\nmance under the (asymptotically) stationary assumption on IoT\ndynamics relative to control decisions in the fast timescale.\nCorresponding to different types of state dynamics in Table I,\nwe outline three classes of management schemes; see Fig. 2.\nA. Leveraging statistical learning for IoT management\nAs the generic problem (1), consider the IoT operator makes\na per-slot decision xt, subject to the short-term constraints that\nare collected in a compact set X (st) parameterized by the IoT\nstate st \u2208 S, as well as the long-term constraints that are\nexpressed as a time-varying penalty function g(xt; st) \u2208 RN .\nWith the IoT cost f(xt; st), we wish to find a sequence of\ndecisions {xt} that minimize the expected limiting-average\ncost subject to the long-term and short-term constraints, i.e.,\nf\u2217 := minimize\n{xt\u2208X (st), \u2200t}\nlim\nT\u2192\u221e\n1\nT\nT\u2211\nt=1\nE [f(xt; st)] (4a)\n6!\"#$%&'\n(&\"%)&%'\n!\"#$%&'\n(&\"%)&%'\n!\"#$%&'\n!\"#$#%&#'()*+'&,(\"-$.\"/(''&#0\n!\"/(1&%&#'()*+'&,(\"-$.\"/(''&#0\n!\"#$%&'\n(&\"%)&%'\n!#\"&#'()*+'&,(\"-$.\"/(''&#0\nFig. 2: Three levels of interaction between IoT operator (learner) and\nnature corresponding to the three assumptions in Table I.\nsubject to lim\nT\u2192\u221e\n1\nT\nT\u2211\nt=1\nE [g(xt; st)] \u2264 0 (4b)\nwhere E is taken over the random state st, and possible\nrandomness we may opt to introduce in the decision xt.\nComparing with (1), the infinite time horizon and the limiting\naverage cost are used in (4) and throughout this section\nfor mathematical simplicity. Indeed, assuming st is i.i.d. or\ngenerally stationary, the dynamic problem (4) shares the same\noptimal objective value as the following static problem [71]\nf\u2217 := minimize\n{pi(st)\u2208X (st), st}\nE [f(pi(st); st)]\nsubject to E [g(pi(st); st)] \u2264 0.\n(5a)\n(5b)\nTo this end, our goal is to determine a possibly randomized\npolicy pi that given an IoT state st, generates xt = pi(st)\nso as to minimize the average cost subject to both long- and\nshort-term constraints in (5). The infinite-dimension functional\noptimization problem (5) is more tractable in its dual form,\nwhich entails a finite number of variables [17], [76]. With\n\u03bb \u2208 RN+ denoting the multipliers, the Lagrangian of (5)\nis L(pi,\u03bb) := E[L(pi(st),\u03bb; st)] where the instantaneous\n(per state) Lagrangian is L(pi(st),\u03bb; st) := f(pi(st); st) +\n\u03bb>g(pi(st); st). Correspondingly, the dual problem of (5) is\nmaximize\n\u03bb\u22650\nD(\u03bb) := E [D(\u03bb; st)] (6)\nwhere D(\u03bb; st) := minx\u2208X (st) L(x,\u03bb; st). With the optimal\n\u03bb\u2217 obtained for the dual problem (6), the optimal policy for\nthe problem (5) could be retrieved as\npi\u2217(st) := arg min\nx\u2208X (st)\nL(x,\u03bb\u2217; st). (7)\nThe ensemble problem (6) is difficult to solve since the\nprobability density distribution of st is usually unknown.\nTo find the optimal multipliers \u03bb\u2217 in an efficient manner,\nexisting methods mainly rely on the stochastic subgradient-\nbased (SGD) methods [38], [71], [96]. However, SGD is\nTime\n\u2026 \u2026\nFig. 3: Timescale splitting for offline-aided online SAGA operations.\nIterates {\u03bbt} generate actual IoT decision, while \u03bb1|t, . . . ,\u03bbK|t are\nK virtual iterates updated via (9) at slot t; and \u03bbt+1 := \u03bbK|t.\nknown to suffer from slow convergence, which implies that the\nIoT network needs to implement sufficient many suboptimal\ndecisions generated during the transient stage of SGD.\nFrom a different viewpoint, given the huge volume of histor-\nical data generated by IoT networks, (6) was first formulated in\n[17] as a statistical learning task involving both offline training\nand online operational phases. The rationale is that historical\ndata contain statistics of the IoT states, and learning from\nthem can aid coping with the uncertainty of future management\ntasks, leading to reduced transient time of adaptive algorithms.\nSpecifically, with a training set of N0 historical IoT state\nsamples S\u02c60 := {sn, 1 \u2264 n \u2264 N0} available offline, (6) can be\nrecast in an empirical form via sample averaging as\nmax\n\u03bb\u22650\nD\u02c6S\u02c60(\u03bb), with D\u02c6S\u02c60(\u03bb) :=\n1\nN0\nN0\u2211\nn=1\nD\u02c6n(\u03bb)\u2212 \u000f\n2\n\u2016\u03bb\u20162 (8)\nwhere D\u02c6n(\u03bb) := D(\u03bb; sn), and \u000f > 0 is a regulariza-\ntion constant typically used in statistical learning to boost\ngeneralization capability [93]. Note that while an `2-norm\nregularizer is adopted in (8), other forms of regularization (e.g.,\n`1 and total-variation norm) are also possible depending on a-\npriori knowledge. Note that here t has been replaced by n to\ndifferentiate historical data from data in online phases.\nViewing (8) as a (negated) empirical risk minimization\n(ERM) task, we can resort to the state-of-the-art optimiza-\ntion methods for ERM, e.g., SAGA [33], that enjoys fast\nconvergence and low complexity. Using SAGA, per iteration\nk, we evaluate a single summand of the empirical gradi-\nent, i.e., \u2207D\u02c6\u03bd(k)(\u03bbk) at the iterate \u03bbk, with sample index\n\u03bd(k) \u2208 {1, . . . , N0} selected uniformly at random. Thus,\nthe computational complexity of SAGA is that of a SGD\niteration for (8). Furthermore, SAGA stores a collection of the\noutdated gradients {\u2207oldD\u02c6n} for all samples, where \u2207oldD\u02c6n\nwas evaluated by \u03bbk[n] \u2014 the most recent iteration k[n] that\nsn was drawn; i.e., k[n] := sup{k\u2032 : \u03bd(k\u2032) =n, k\u2032<k}. SAGA\ncombines the fresh gradient with the stored ones as\n\u03bbk+1 =\n[\n\u03bbk+\u03b1\n(\n\u2207D\u02c6\u03bd(k)(\u03bbk)\u2212\u2207oldD\u02c6\u03bd(k) +\u2207oldD\u02c6S\u02c60\n)]+\n(9)\nwhere \u03b1 is the pre-defined stepsize, and the stored gradients\nare \u2207oldD\u02c6S\u02c60 := (1/N)\n\u2211N\nn=1\u2207oldD\u02c6n \u2212 \u000f\u03bbk.\nThe merits of SAGA lie in the fact that its gradient estimator\nin (9) is still unbiased as that with SGD. In addition to the\nunbiasedness however, SAGA\u2019s gradient estimator attains con-\nsiderably lower variance than SGD thanks to the contribution of\nthe stored previous gradients, which is now termed the variance\nreduction technique prevalent in large scale machine learning\ntasks. Needless to mention the encouraging empirical results,\nthe SAGA in (9) is provably convergent to the optimum of (8)\n7with the linear convergence rate [17], [33]\nE\u03bd\n[\nD\u02c6\u2217S\u02c60 \u2212 D\u02c6S\u02c60(\u03bbk)\n]\n= O(\u03c1k) (10)\nwhere D\u02c6\u2217S\u02c60 is the optimal objective of (8), and \u03c1 \u2208 (0, 1) is\nthe linear rate depending on the objective function of (8).\nHence, in the offline phase, we run KN0 SAGA iterations\n(9) on set S\u02c60 - on average K iterations per sample. In the online\nphase, initialized with the offline output, SAGA (we term\nonline SAGA) keeps acquiring data st with a growing training\nset S\u02c6t := S\u02c6t\u22121 \u222a st. At slot t, online SAGA is initialized with\nthe last iterate of slot t \u2212 1, and updates \u03bbt by running K\niterations (9); see Fig. 3. The IoT decision is generated using\nthe current \u03bbt by pit(st) = arg minx\u2208X (st) L(x,\u03bbt; st). This\nis the key idea of offline-aided online IoT operations.\nThe offline-aided online scheme is not simply heuristic. In\nfact, the learning performance can be rigorously quantified via\nseveral concentration results in the learning theory [93], which\nuniformly bound the discrepancy between the empirical loss\n(8) and the loss (6) with high probability (whp), i.e.,\nsup\n\u03bb\u22650\n|D(\u03bb)\u2212 D\u02c6S\u02c6t(\u03bb)| \u2264 Hs(Nt), whp (11)\nwhere Hs(Nt) bounds the statistical error induced by the finite\nsize Nt of the training set S\u02c6t. Under proper (so-termed mixing)\nconditions, the law of large numbers guarantees that Hs(Nt) is\ngenerally in the order of O(\u221a1/Nt) [93, Section 3.4]. On the\nother hand, let Ho(KNt) upper bound the optimization error\nof solving (8) with S\u02c6t due to running on average only finite\n(K) iterations per sample; i.e., D\u02c6\u2217S\u02c6t\u2212D\u02c6S\u02c6t(\u03bbt) \u2264 Ho(KNt).\nOnline SAGA aims at a \u201csweet-spot\u201d between affordable\ncomplexity (controlled by K) and desirable overall learning\nerror, which accounts for both the optimization and statis-\ntical errors Hs(Nt) + Ho(KNt). Specifically, if we select\nN0 \u2265 3\u03ba/4 with \u03ba denoting the condition number of (8), and\nK \u2265 6, the optimization error is bounded by Ho(KNt) \u2264\nHs(Nt) [17]. In fact, even with K = 1, online SAGA can\nstill guarantee that Ho(KNt) = O (Hs(Nt)). With the link\nbetween the optimal policy and the optimal multiplier (7) in\nmind, the key message here is that with sufficient historical\nsamples, online SAGA only requires running a small number\nof iterations per slot to bring the optimization error close\nto the statistical accuracy provided by the current training\nset. Recent works along this line also include [36], [45] that\nfocused on algorithms for piecewise stationary environments.\nLearning more complex policies for non-interactive settings\nhas been also studied by leveraging deep neural networks\n[87]. Possible future research along this line also includes\ndeveloping algorithms under the assumption of stationarity\nin high-order moments, which is also pertinent in practice.\nAlgorithms tailored for fully nonstationary settings will be\npresented in Section IV.\nB. Learn-and-adapt approaches in semi-interactive settings\nThe IoT environment in Section III-A is non-interactive,\nmeaning that the dynamic of st+1 in (5) does not change\naccording to xt. The IoT states can be also driven by decisions,\nwhich include the job queue length in a data center [18], the\nlane length in a transportation network [42], as well as the\nAdapt       to        \nand generate\nAdaptationLearning\nAdd current     , \nand update    \nIoT operationMonitor IoT state     \nand\nFig. 4: A learn-and-adapt diagram for IoT management.\nbattery level in a smart grid [85], [95]. This section considers\nthe case where such IoT states appear in the constraints, but not\nin the objectives, which we call the semi-interactive settings.\nConsider an IoT network represented as a directed graph\nG = (N , E) with nodes N := {1, . . . , N} and edges E :=\n{1, . . . , E}. The node-incidence matrix is formed with (n, e)\nentry A(n,e) = 1(\u22121) if link e enters (leaves) node n, and\nA(n,e) = 0, otherwise. With ct \u2208 RN+ collecting the exogenous\nresources of all nodes per slot t, xt \u2208 RE for the endogenous\nresources across edges, the aggregate resource is Axt + ct.\nConnecting with (5), ct is included in the IoT state st, and the\nconstraint becomes g(xt; st) = Axt + ct. With qt collecting\nall buffered resources at slot t, we wish to solve (4) with the\nadditional state dynamics and the long-term constraints as\nqt+1 = [qt +Axt + ct]\n+\n, \u2200t (12a)\nlim\nT\u2192\u221e\n(1/T )\n\u2211T\nt=1E [\u2016qt\u2016] <\u221e. (12b)\nDue to the extra constraints in (12), the optimal objective of\nthis new problem is at least f\u2217 in (4). Furthermore, the dynamic\nof the interactive state qt (a.k.a. queues) in (12a) also accounts\nfor the transient performance of an adaptive algorithm. To see\nthis, suppose that under pi\u2217, it holds that Api\u2217(st) + ct =\n0, \u2200st; and consider the convergence path of policy pit induced\nby \u03bbt as pi1 \u2192 pi2 \u2192 pi3 = . . . = piT = pi\u2217, along with\nApi1(s1) + c1 = 10 and Api2(s2) + c2 = 5. In this case, if\nq1 = 0, then we have q2 = 10 and q3 = . . . = qT = 15.\nThe simple example entails two variable insights: i) con-\nstraint violations incurred by the sub-optimal decisions during\nthe transient stage (e.g., pi1,pi2) accumulate via qt; and ii) once\naccumulated in the transient stage, qt will not decrease in the\nsteady state (e.g., pit, t \u2265 3). This explains the suboptimal\nperformance tradeoff of SGD for (4) with (12); see also [21].\nTo better control the interactive state qt, it suffices to:\nS1) reduce the transient time of the adaptive algorithm; and,\nS2) diminish qt accumulated during the transient stage.\nFollowing this two guidelines, we adopt a procedure in\nthe online phase that we term online learning-and-adaptation\n(named use LA-SAGA henceforth); see a diagram in Fig. 4.\nRegarding S1), LA-SAGA performs the offline-aided online\nlearning as that in Fig. 3, by growing the training set S\u02c6t\nbased on which it better learns \u03bbt; and for S2), LA-SAGA\nsuperimposes \u03bbt to the instantaneous state (buffered resources)\nqt, and comes up with an effective multiplier as\n\u03b8t\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\neffective multiplier\n= \u03bbt\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nstatistical learning\n+ \u00b5qt \u2212 b\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nsystem interaction\n(13)\n8where \u00b5 tunes emphasis to statistical versus interactive state\ninformation, and b is a constant that corrects the possible bias\nin the steady-state - the intuition will become transparent soon.\nBased on \u03b8t, the real-time IoT decision xt is obtained by\nminimizing the Lagrangian over X (st); that is,\npit(st) = xt := arg min\nx\u2208X (st)\nL(x,\u03b8t; st). (14)\nNote that different from stochastic allocation that is solely\nbased on the system feedback \u03b8t = \u00b5qt [71], and statistical\nlearning that only relies on \u03b8t = \u03bbt, LA-SAGA can take\nadvantage of both through the use of effective multiplier \u03b8t.\nTo grasp how the effective multiplier accounts for S2),\nsuppose that after sufficient learning processes, \u03bbt \u2248 \u03bb\u2217, and\nqt is large so that \u00b5qt \u2212 b \u001d 0. In this case, we have the\n\u201cshadow price\u201d \u03b8t \u001d \u03bb\u2217, and thus xt obtained through (14)\nwould ensure that Axt + ct < 0 so that qt+1 < qt via (12a).\nIntuitively speaking, \u03b8t will eventually oscillate around \u03bb\u2217, and\nthus qt will oscillate around b/\u00b5 - this also suggests a positive\nb, otherwise it leads to a biased \u03b8t \u2265 \u03bb\u2217 since qt \u2265 0.\nRigorous analysis demonstrate that through a proper selec-\ntion of the bias b = O\u02dc(\u221a\u00b5), \u03b8t will converge to the O(\u221a\u00b5)-\nneighborhood of \u03bb\u2217 for (6); formally, we have [17]\nlim\nT\u2192\u221e\n(1/T )\n\u2211T\nt=1E [f (xt; st)]\u2212 f\u2217 = O(\u00b5) (15a)\nlim\nT\u2192\u221e\n(1/T )\n\u2211T\nt=1E [\u2016qt\u2016] = O\u02dc (1/\n\u221a\n\u00b5) (15b)\nwhich asserts that LA-SAGA is O(\u00b5)-optimal with an average\nqueue length O\u02dc(1/\u221a\u00b5) - an elegant [O(\u00b5), O\u02dc(1/\u221a\u00b5)] tradeoff.\nComparing with the tradeoff [O(\u00b5),O(1/\u00b5)] under Lyapunov\noptimization in [71], LA-SAGA [17], [21] improves the per-\nformance in terms of constraint violations (queue lengths).\nThe idea of incorporating learning into network optimization\nis pioneered in [46]. However, the developed learning mecha-\nnism therein suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Targeting\nlarge-scale IoT networks, LA-SAGA can tackle settings with\ncontinuous S and X with possibly infinite elements, and still\nbe amenable to efficient and scalable online operations. The\nimportant implication of the learn-and-adapt scheme is that\nit can perform the optimal IoT management, with reduced\nresources and improved QoS, namely, reduced queueing delay\nin data centers [21], faster virtual network function placement\n[23], and lower congestion in transportation networks, or\nsmaller battery capacity in power grids [52].\nAs a closing remark of this subsection, note that while the\nproblem considered in the semi-interactive setting here ex-\nplicitly contains queueing-type constraints, the semi-interactive\nsettings in fact cover a broader class of problems in IoT. For\ninstance, throughput maximization in UAV-enabled wireless\nnetworks under trajectory constraints also belongs to the class\nof semi-interactive IoT settings [100], [105].\nC. Reinforcement learning for interactive IoT environments\nThe IoT environment considered in Section III-B is semi-\ninteractive in the sense that only the dynamic of qt+1 (but\nnot st+1) changes according to xt through (12a). To broaden\nthe scope of the unified framework, this subsection introduces\nmethods tailored for the fully interactive setups, where the\ndynamic of IoT state st that can appear both in the objectives\nand the constraints is driven by the decision xt. This set-\nting captures the trajectory optimization in UAV-aided mobile\ncommunications, e.g., [100], [105], the dynamic caching with\nlimited storage units, e.g., [78], and the route planning in\nintelligent transportation, e.g., [106].\nFor simplicity, consider an IoT environment with a finite\nstate space S, and a finite action space X . The interaction\nbetween the operator and the IoT environment is uniquely\ncaptured by the transition probability of going from the current\nstate s to the subsequent state s\u2032 under action x \u2208 X (s) \u2286 X ,\ngiven by [Px]ss\u2032 := P(st+1 = s|st = s\u2032,xt = x). Similar to\n(5), the goal is to determine a possibly randomized policy pi\nthat given a state st, generates xt = pi(st) so as to minimize\nthe total discounted cost1, that is\nminimize\n{pi(st)\u2208X (st), st}\nlim\nT\u2192\u221e\nE\n[\nT\u2211\nt=1\n\u03b3t\u22121f (pi(st); st)\n]\n(16)\nwhere \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 1) is a discounting factor, and E is taken over\nthe sample path of {st}, as well as the random policy pi.\nFor a fixed policy pi, the state value function is defined as\nVpi(s) := lim\nT\u2192\u221e\nE\n[\nT\u2211\nt=1\n\u03b3t\u22121f (pi(st); st)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223s1 = s] (17)\nand the state-action value function (so-termed Q-function) is\nQpi(s,x) := f (x; s)+\u03b3Es\u2032|s,x [Vpi(s\u2032)], where E is taken over\nthe one-step transition from the current state s to s\u2032 under\naction x. With the optimal policy pi\u2217, we have that2\npi\u2217(s) := arg min\nx\u2208X (s)\nQ\u2217(s,x) (18)\nand V \u2217(s) = Q\u2217(s,pi\u2217(s)). Furthermore, the optimality con-\ndition of (16) that is termed Bellman optimality equation can\nbe written as (e.g., [90])\nQ\u2217(s,x)=f (x; s)+\u03b3Es\u2032|s,x\n[\nmin\nx\u2032\u2208X (s)\nQ\u2217(s\u2032,x\u2032)\n]\n, \u2200x, s (19)\nwhich is a system of nonlinear equations of Q\u2217 \u2208 R|S|\u00d7|X|.\nSwitching the goal from (16) to the fixed point of the Bell-\nman optimality equation (19), a classical yet popular approach\nis the so-termed Q-learning algorithm [98]:\nS1) At slot t, select the decision xt by\npit(st) = xt :=\n{\narg min\nx\u2208X (st)\nQt (st,x) w.p. 1\u2212 \u000ft\nrandom x \u2208 X (st) w.p. \u000ft\n(20)\nwhere \u000ft > 0 is a pre-defined exploration constant, and st+1\nis generated according to P(st+1 = s) = [Pxt ]sts.\nS2) Update the state-action value function as\nQt+1(st,xt) =Qt(st,xt)\n\u2212\u03b1t\n(\nf (xt; st) + \u03b3 min\nx\u2208X (st+1)\nQt(st+1,x)\n)\n(21)\nwhere \u03b1t is a pre-defined stepsize. Note that different from\nSections III-A and III-B, the explicit form of the objective\n1For simplicity, the infinite horizon discounted formulation is considered \u2014\na slight mismatch with the generic one (1). Other formulations with constraints\nor average costs can be also considered with additional assumptions [6].\n2We interchangeably use Q\u2217(s,x) = Qpi\u2217 (s,x) and V \u2217(s) = Vpi\u2217 (s).\n9function f ( \u00b7 ; st) does not need to be known per slot t. Instead,\nonly the functions values {f (x\u03c4 ; s\u03c4 )}t\u03c4=1 along the trajectory\n(s1,x1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (st,xt) are assumed to be known. With properly\nselected {\u000ft, \u03b1t}, the simple Q-learning algorithm is provably\nconvergent under the finite state and action spaces (a.k.a.\ntabular case) [90]. To date, convergence of Q-learning and\nits variants is mostly asserted for the tabular case.\nTo scale up Q-learning in the large-scale settings, recent\nefforts have been devoted to infer Q by minimizing the residual\nof the Bellman optimality equation (19); that is,\nmin\nQ\n\u2211\nx,s\n(\nQ(s,x)\u2212 f (x; s)\u2212 \u03b3Es\u2032|s,x\n[\nmin\nx\u2032\u2208X (s)\nQ(s\u2032,x\u2032)\n])2\n.\n(22)\nAlbeit its simple expression, several fundamental challenges\narise when solving this fitting problem (22):\nC1) the optimization scale can be prohibitively huge due to the\npossibly large state and action spaces;\nC2) the unknown conditional expectation Es\u2032|s,x inside the\nsquare loss prevents an easy unbiased gradient estimator; and,\nC3) the max operator inside the square loss introduces non-\nsmoothness and non-convexity when performing optimization.\nTo tackle C1), function approximation methods have been\nstudied using linear or nonlinear (random) basis functions\n[13], [84]. Roughly speaking, given a state-action pair (x, s)\nalong with its pre-defined feature vector \u03c6x,s \u2208 Rd, existing\napproaches will approximate the Q-function by Q(s,x) :=\nz>(\u03c6x,s)\u03b8, where z(\u03c6x,s) \u2208 R2D is a lifted feature vector\n(e.g., random features or outputs of deep neural networks)\ngenerated from \u03c6x,s and \u03b8 \u2208 R2D is the wanted parameter\nvector. To this end, the task of finding the |S| \u00d7 |A| function\n(matrix) Q reduces to finding the 2D-dimensional vector\n\u03b8. Along this line, several recent works based on primal-\ndual solvers have made significant progress on simultaneously\nresolving C1) and C2) [30], [99]. Regarding C3), while it is\nstill an active research area, approaches leveraging smoothing\ntechniques for nonsmooth functions in convex optimization\nhave shed light on promising remedies [31], [70].\nIn addition to value iteration-based methods such as Q-\nlearning, approaches based on direct policy search such as\npolicy gradients and actor-critic methods are also prevalent\nnowadays, e.g., [83], [91], [108]. This key idea behind policy\ngradient is to update the \u03b8-parametrized policy pi\u03b8 using the\ngradient of the discounted objective (16) with respect to the\npolicy parameters [91]. Convergence of the policy gradient\nwith deep neural networks or kernel-based function approx-\nimators is now better understood than Q-learning, along with\nthe limitations of policy gradient-based methods that arise from\ntheir high variance.\nWe conclude this section by remarking that approaches in\nlight of the offline-aided-online learning have also been studied\nfor (16) under the name of experience replay, which achieves\ntremendous success in various artificial intelligence tasks [68].\nIV. SCALABILITY IN ONLINE LEARNING FOR IOT\nThe IoT settings considered in Section III involve slow-\nvarying IoT dynamics that are (asymptotically) stationary rel-\native to the timescale of making decisions. In large-scale IoT\nNature:\nLearner:\nConstraint:\nLearner:\nLoss:\nA full-information IoT setting\nA semi-bandit IoT setting\nNature:\nLearner:\nA bandit IoT setting\nFig. 5: Three forms of feedback in IoT environments (termed nature)\ncorrespond to three different types of information oracle in Table I.\nhowever, real-time control and communications entail slow\nand fast time scales that prompt scalable online solvers for\ngenerally nonstationary settings \u2014 the topics of this section.\nIn addition to the general non-stationarity, special attention\nwill be given to approaches designed under limited informa-\ntion about the environment, or equivalently, solvers requiring\nlimited computation and communication resources to sense the\nenvironment. Corresponding to different information that may\nbe available in IoT, we outline three classes of scalable online\nlearning approaches; see also Fig. 5 for a comparison.\nA. Constrained online learning for IoT management\nConsider a finite time horizon T . Per slot t, the IoT operator\nselects an action xt from a known and fixed convex set\nX \u2286 Rd, and the IoT environment (a.k.a. nature in OCO) then\nreveals a loss ft : Rd \u2192 R, along with a time-varying (possibly\nadversarial) penalty function gt : Rd \u2192 RN . The latter leads\nto a time-varying constraint gt(x) \u2264 0, which is driven by the\nunknown IoT dynamics. As in (1), the goal here is to generate\na sequence of decisions that minimize the aggregate loss, and\nensure that the constraints are satisfied in the long term on\naverage. Specifically, we wish to solve\nminimize\n{xt\u2208X ,\u2200t}\nT\u2211\nt=1\nft(xt) subject to\nT\u2211\nt=1\ngt(xt) \u2264 0. (23)\nComparing with the generic problem (1), we keep the time-\nvarying IoT state st implicit in (23), e.g., ft(xt) := f(xt; st)\nand gt(xt) := g(xt; st), since the algorithms introduced in this\nsection may not need to directly sense the state st. For (23), if\n{ft,gt} are known and T is not prohibitively large, the optimal\ndecisions can be found using any off-the-shelf batch solver.\nAlong with the potentially high complexity of batch solvers, a\nkey challenge is that loss and constraint functions in dynamic\nIoT setups are often unknown before allocating resources, due\nto unpredictable channel blocking, in millimeter wave links,\ndue to the unpredictable routing, network congestion, device\nmalfunctions, and nowadays malicious attacks.\n10\nConsider an edge layer with low-power sensors; a fog\nwith N nodes in N ; and, a cloud with multiple computing\ncenters [25]. Per slot t, each node n collects data requests dnt\nfrom nearby sensors, and has to decide among three options:\ni) offloading an amount \u03c7nt (from d\nn\nt ) to the cloud;\nii) offloading xnmt to node m for collaborative computing; and,\niii) processing an amount xnnt using the in-situ fog servers.\nVariable xt consists of all the decisions in i) - iii); see Fig. 6.\nSupposing that each fog node has a local queue to buffer\nunserved workloads, a long-term constraint is imposed to\nensure that the cumulative amount of served workloads is no\nless than the arrived amount over T slots; that is,\nT\u2211\nt=1\ngnt (xt) \u22640, \u2200n\ngnt (xt) := d\nn\nt +\n\u2211\nm\u2208N inn\nxmnt \u2212\n\u2211\nm\u2208N outn\nxnmt \u2212 \u03c7nt \u2212 xnnt (24)\nwhere N inn (N outn ) is the set of fog nodes with in-coming (out-\ngoing) links to (from) node n. Clearly, amounts \u03c7nt , x\nnm\nt , and\nxnnt have caps depending on the communication protocols and\ncomputing cores in use. With x\u00af collecting all these caps, the\nfeasible set is X :={0 \u2264 xt \u2264 x\u00af}.\nAmong candidate figures of merit in optimizing xt, is\nnetwork delay of the online edge processing and offloading\ndecisions [9], [22]. Specifically, the latency associated with \u03c7nt\nis mainly due to the communication delay, which can be mod-\neled as a time-varying convex function lnt (\u03c7\nn\nt ). Likewise, the\ncommunication delay related to xnmt is denoted by l\nnm\nt (x\nnm\nt ).\nIn addition, latency pertaining to xnnt comes from its limited\ncomputation capability, which can be modeled as a function\nhnt (x\nnn\nt ) capturing dynamics during the computing processes.\nThe overall performance in allocating xt is quantified by\naggregate latency metrics. Those include computational (lt)\nand communication delays (ht), namely\nft(xt) :=\n\u2211\nn\u2208N\n(\nlnt (\u03c7\nn\nt ) +\n\u2211\nm\u2208N outn l\nnm\nt (x\nnm\nt ) +h\nn\nt (x\nnn\nt )\n)\n.(25)\nWhile the aggregate delay in some cases cannot directly\nreflect user experience, a viable alternative is the maximum\nof computational and communication delays; see e.g., [22].\nWhile the average-delay objective presumed in (23) may not\nbe the optimal performance metric in some mission critical\napplications, our formulation can also cover the probabilistic\ndelay requirements. The per-slot objective of the latter is an\nindicator function of the delay given by\nft(xt) :=\n\u2211\nn\u2208N\n1\n{(\nlnt (\u03c7\nn\nt ) +\n\u2211\nm\u2208N outn\nlnmt (x\nnm\nt ) + h\nn\nt (x\nnn\nt )\n)\n\u2264 l\u00af\n}\n(26)\nwhere l\u00af is a pre-defined upper bound of user delay. The price\npaid is that the resultant problem is nonconvex, which can be\ntackled by e.g., the approach in Section IV-C.\nWith ft(xt) as in (25) and constraints as in (24), the solution\nof (23) aims to minimize the aggregate delay, while serving\nall IoT demands in the long term. Looking forward, more\nintriguing is to find such an optimal strategy in a fully causal\nsetting, where {ft(xt), dnt } are unknown when deciding xt,\nEdges\nCloud center\nFog clusters\nEdges\nFig. 6: A diagram for mobile computation offloading: IoT devices at\nthe edge layer; fog clusters contain locally connected fog nodes, and\nthe data center in the cloud layer.\nbut are revealed at the end of slot t after deciding xt.\nTo gauge the performance of online decisions, static regret\nis adopted by OCO to measure how far the aggregate loss of\nan OCO algorithm is from the best fixed solution in hindsight\n[109]. Since a static regret relies on a rather coarse benchmark,\nwhich is less useful in dynamic IoT [16], we are motivated to\npursue the so-termed dynamic regret given by\nRegdT :=\nT\u2211\nt=1\nft(xt)\u2212\nT\u2211\nt=1\nft(x\n\u2217\nt ) (27a)\nwith x\u2217t \u2208 arg min\nx\u2208X\nft(x), subject to gt(x)\u22640 (27b)\nwhere the benchmark is now formed using the best sequence\n{x\u2217t } for the instantaneous problem, subject to the instan-\ntaneous constraint. The metric in (5) is more suitable for\nassessing performance of dynamic IoT networks than its static\ncounterpart in [109], because a sub-linear dynamic regret\nimplies a sub-linear static one, but the converse is not true.\nRegarding feasibility of online decisions, the dynamic fit is\nalso useful to quantify the accumulated violations, that is\nFitdT :=\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\n[\nT\u2211\nt=1\ngt(xt)\n]+\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225. (28)\nThe long-term constraint implicitly assumes that the instanta-\nneous constraint violations can be compensated by subsequent\nstrictly feasible decisions, thus allowing adaptation of fog\ndecisions to the unknown dynamics of IoT user demands.\nUnder the metrics in (27) and (28), an ideal algorithm will\nbe one that achieves both sub-linear dynamic regret and sub-\nlinear dynamic fit. A sub-linear dynamic regret implies \u201cno-\nregret\u201d relative to the clairvoyant dynamic solution on the long-\nterm average; i.e., limT\u2192\u221eRegdT /T = 0, while a sub-linear\ndynamic fit indicates that the online strategy is also feasible\non average; i.e., limT\u2192\u221e FitdT /T = 0.\nWith \u03bb \u2208 RN+ denoting the Lagrange multiplier vector, the\nLagrangian of (23) is\nLt(x,\u03bb) := ft(x) + \u03bb>gt(x). (29)\nBuilding on (29), an online scheme termed modified saddle-\npoint (MOSP) approach has been developed first in [16] and\nlater in [102]. We use the low-complexity variant in [102] for\nthe subsequent illustration. Given xt and \u03bbt, the decision xt+1\nis\nxt+1 = PX (xt \u2212 \u03b1\u2207xLt(xt,\u03bbt)) (30)\n11\nwhere PX (y) := arg minx\u2208X \u2016x \u2212 y\u20162; \u03b1 is a pre-defined\nconstant; and, \u2207xLt(xt,\u03bbt) = \u2207ft(xt) +\u2207>gt(xt)\u03bbt is the\ngradient of Lt(x,\u03bbt) with respect to (w.r.t.) x. In addition, the\ndual update takes the modified online gradient ascent form\n\u03bbt+1 =\n[\n\u03bbt + \u00b5(gt(xt) +\u2207>gt(xt)(xt+1 \u2212 xt))\n]+\n(31)\nwhere \u00b5 is the stepsize, and gt(xt) the gradient of Lt(xt,\u03bb)\nw.r.t. \u03bb. Note that (31) is a modified gradient update since the\ndual variable is updated along the first-order approximation of\ngt(xt+1) at xt rather than the commonly used gt(xt).\nWith properly chosen stepsizes, MOSP enjoys dynamic\nregret and fit bounded by [16]\nRegdT =O\n(\nV(x\u22171:T )T\n1\n2\n)\nand FitdT = O\n(\nT\n1\n2\n)\n(32)\nwhere V(x\u22171:T ) is the accumulated variation of the per-slot\nminimizers x\u2217t in (27) given by V(x\u22171:T ) :=\n\u2211T\nt=1 \u2016x\u2217t\u2212x\u2217t\u22121\u2016.\nIn words, MOSP\u2019s dynamic fit is sub-linear, and its dynamic\nregret is also sub-linear, so long as the variation of the\nminimizers is slow enough; i.e., V(x\u22171:T ) = o(\n\u221a\nT ).\nRelevant approaches developed in similar settings also in-\nclude [11], [32], [55]. Specifically, OCO with switching cost\nhas been studied in [55], and feedback-based tracking algo-\nrithms have been developed in [11], [32].\nRemark 1 (Learning via task-adaptive stepsizes). The primal\nupdate (30) can be refined by adjusting each entry of the\ngradient using a per-entry stepsize in accordance with \u201ceach\nthing\u201d in IoT applications [22]. Such an adaptive stepsize can\nbe regarded as an inexpensive approximation of the Hessian\nused in the online Newton iteration [35]. Using edge computing\nas a paradigm, [22] showed that task-adaptive stepsizes can\nmarkedly reduce the network delay when the underlying IoT\ntasks are heterogeneous, where the resultant gradients could\nhave distinct orders of magnitude over different coordinates.\nB. Constrained convex bandit learning for IoT management\nThe online recursions (30) and (31) remain operational under\nthe premise that the loss functions are known, or, their gradients\nare readily available. Clearly, none of these assumptions is\nalways satisfied in IoT, because i) the loss function capturing\nuser dissatisfaction, e.g., service latency or reliability, can be\nhard to model in dynamic settings; and, ii) even if model-\ning is possible, the low-power devices may not afford the\ncomplexity of running statistical learning tools such as deep\nneural networks online. These considerations motivate online\nbandit saddle-point (BanSP) methods to broaden the scope of\nMOSP to IoT settings where the gradient is unavailable or\ncomputationally costly [19].\nThe key idea behind bandit learning is to construct (prefer-\nably stochastic) gradient estimates using limited function value\ninformation [37], [72]. Consider first a learner only observing\nthe value of ft(x) at a single point x per slot t. The crux is to\nconstruct a (possibly unbiased) estimate of the gradient using\nthis single piece of feedback - what is interestingly possible\nby one random function evaluation [37]. The intuition is easy\nto grasp in the one-dimensional case: For a binary variable u\ntaking values {\u22121, 1} equiprobably, and a small \u03b4 > 0, the\ndifference approximation of the derivative f \u2032t at x yields\nf \u2032t(x) \u2248\nft(x+ \u03b4)\u2212 ft(x\u2212 \u03b4)\n2\u03b4\n= Eu\n[u\n\u03b4\nft(x+ \u03b4u)\n]\n(33)\nwhere the equality follows from the definition of expectation.\nDropping Eu, the scaled single-value evaluation ft(x+\u03b4u)u/\u03b4\nis a nearly unbiased estimator of f \u2032t(x). Generalizing this\napproximation to higher dimensions, with a random vector u\ndrawn from the surface of a unit sphere, the scaled function\nevaluation at a perturbed point x + \u03b4u yields an estimate of\nthe gradient \u2207ft(x), given by [37]\n\u2207ft(x) \u2248 Eu\n[\nd\n\u03b4\nft(x+ \u03b4u)u\n]\n:= Eu\n[\n\u2207\u02c6ft(x)\n]\n(34)\nwhere we define one-point gradient \u2207\u02c6ft(x) := d\u03b4 ft(x+ \u03b4u)u.\nBuilding upon (34), consider the primal update (cf. (30))\nx\u02c6t+1 = P(1\u2212\u03b3)X\n(\nx\u02c6t \u2212 \u03b1\n(\n\u2207\u02c6ft(x\u02c6t) +\u2207>gt(x\u02c6t)\u03bbt\n))\n(35)\nwhere (1 \u2212 \u03b3)X := {(1 \u2212 \u03b3)x : x \u2208 X} is a subset of X ,\nand \u03b3 \u2208 [0, 1) is a pre-selected constant dependent on \u03b4. In\nthe full-information case, xt in (30) is the learner\u2019s action,\nwhereas in the bandit case the learner\u2019s action is xt := x\u02c6t+\u03b4ut,\nwhich is the point for function evaluation instead of x\u02c6t in (35).\nProjection in (35) is on a smaller convex set (1\u2212\u03b3)X in (35),\nwhich ensures feasibility of the perturbed xt \u2208 X . Similar to\n(31), the dual update of BanSP is given by\n\u03bbt+1 =\n[\n\u03bbt + \u00b5(gt(x\u02c6t) +\u2207>gt(x\u02c6t)(x\u02c6t+1 \u2212 x\u02c6t))\n]+\n(36)\nwhere x\u02c6t rather than xt is used in this update. Compared with\n(30)-(31), the updates (35)-(36) with one-point bandit feedback\ndo not increase computation or memory requirements; hence,\nthey provide a light-weight surrogate for MOSP to enable\ngradient-free online bandit IoT network optimization.\nIf the mild conditions in [19] are satisfied, the online\ndecisions generated by BanSP yield\nE\n[\nRegdT\n]\n=O\n(\nV(x\u22171:T )T\n3\n4\n)\nand E\n[\nFitdT\n]\n=O(T 34 ) (37)\nwhere E is taken over the sequence of the random actions xt\nwith randomness induced by {ut} perturbations.\nDepending on the underlying dynamics, BanSP can afford\none or multiple loss function evaluations (bandit feedback) per\nslot. If BanSP is endowed with M > 2 function evaluations,\nthe gradient estimate will be more accurate by querying the\nfunction values over M points in the neighborhood of x\u02c6t.\nIntuitively, the performance of BanSP will improve if multiple\nevaluations are available per slot. Indeed, the dynamic regret\nis provably O(V(x\u22171:T )T 12 ), and the dynamic fit FitdT =\nO(T 12 ) [19], which markedly improve upon their single-\npoint counterparts, and reduce to MOSP bounds in the full-\ninformation case (cf. (32)).\nC. Constrained multi-armed bandit learning\nThe salient assumption so far is that IoT decisions belong\nto a time-invariant convex set X . However, IoT devices usu-\nally exhibit time-varying connectivity to the backbone due to\nmobility and cyber attacks, while network configurations are\noften selected from pre-determined protocols.

To account for\ndynamics, only the actions in Xt \u2286 X are available per slot t;\ne.g., xt \u2208 Xt. The availability of actions could be stochastic,\nfollowing a certain probability distribution; or even adversarial,\nin which case nature can arbitrarily choose Xt.\nPer slot t, collect the objective values of all actions into\nvector ft := [ft(x1), . . . , ft(xK)]>, and likewise the con-\nstraints into matrix Gt :=[gt(x1), . . . ,gt(xK)]\u2208RN\u00d7K . If the\nlearner\u2019s strategy is to select an action xt = xk with k from a\ndistribution k \u223c pt \u2208 RK , then (23) can be re-formulated as\nan optimization problem over distributions {pt}, namely\nminimize\n{pt\u2208\u2206(Xt),\u2200t}\nT\u2211\nt=1\nf>t pt subject to\nT\u2211\nt=1\nGtpt \u2264 0 (38)\nwhere the Xt-supported \u201cprobability simplex\u201d is defined as\n\u2206(Xt) :=\n{ \u2211\nxk\u2208Xt\np(xk) = 1; p(xk) \u2265 0; p(xk) = 0,xk /\u2208 Xt\n}\n.\n(39)\nIt is worth mentioning that ft(xk) and gt(xk) are well defined\neven when the action xk /\u2208 Xt is not available, and the values\nft(x\nk) and gt(xk) are not revealed.\nIn order to employ an MOSP solver for (38), the gradient of\nthe associated Lagrangian is needed, meaning ft and Gt must\nbe known. The challenge is that such information is hardly\navailable in large-scale IoT settings, where one only knows\nft(xt) and gt(xt) given that xt is implemented. The time-\nvarying action set also prevents a direct implementation of\nBanSP to solve (38). To tackle such a challenging setting, a\nnovel EXP3SP algorithm was developed in our recent work\n[53] that builds on the elegant exponential-weight algorithm\nfor exploration and exploitation (EXP3) [8].\nPer slot t, the learner observes the action set Xt, and selects\nxt according to the current distribution pt given by\npt(x\nk) =\np\u02dct(x\nk)1(xk \u2208 Xt)\u2211\nxk\u2208X p\u02dct(xk)1(xk \u2208 Xt)\n, \u2200xk \u2208 X (40)\nwhere p\u02dct(xk) is the unnormalized weight of xk at slot t, the\nvalue of which will be specified later.

(41b)\nAdopting the gradient estimators in (41), the primal update\nuses the exponential gradient recursion, namely, \u2200xk \u2208 X\np\u02dct+1(x\nk) = p\u02dct(x\nk) exp\n[\n\u2212\u00b5\n(\nf\u02c6t(x\nk) + \u03bb>t g\u02c6t(x\nk)\n)]\n. (42)\nThe weight p\u02dct+1 is in turn used to generate the action\ndistribution in the next slot (cf. (40)). The dual update is\n\u03bbt+1 =\n[\n\u03bbt + \u00b5\n(\nG\u02c6tpt \u2212 \u03b4\u00b5\u03bbt\n)]+\n(43)\nwhere \u03b4 is a tuned constant to ensure a bounded multiplier.\nIf Xt is stochastic, EXP3SP achieves both sub-linear regret\nand fit [53]. A robust modification of EXP3SP has been also\ndeveloped recently to cope with adversaries blocking access of\nIoT devices to their edge servers [51], while further securing\nedge computing and ensuring sub-linear regret and fit. A\nremark is now in order on a scalable rendition of EXP3SP.\nOur scalable online learning schemes are recapped in Fig. 7.\nV. LESSONS LEARNED AND THE ROAD AHEAD\nWe have presented a unified framework for deriving and\nanalyzing adaptive and scalable network design and resource\nallocation schemes for IoT. Leveraging the contemporary\ncommunication, networking and optimization advances, the\nresultant online learning and management policies not only\nfacilitate low-complexity and scalable implementations with\nlimited feedback, but also enjoy efficient adaptation to chang-\ning environments with analytical performance guarantees.\nThe proposed framework lays a solid analytical foundation to\ndelineate the tradeoffs among performance guarantees, degree\nof (non-)stationarity in modeling IoT dynamics, algorithm\nscalability, and levels of accessible information; see Fig. 8.\nModeling assumptions vs optimality guarantees. While both\ndeal with IoT management with unknown dynamics, the mod-\neling assumptions in Sections III and IV differ considerably.\nSpecifically, those in Section III assume a generally stationary\nIoT environment that corresponds to either the simplest i.i.d.\ncase, or to the Markovian case eventually converging to a\nstationary distribution. In contrast, the approaches in Section\nIV can afford arbitrary dynamics even those manipulated by\nadversaries. However, such minimal assumption does not come\nfor free. As a matter of fact, the performance guarantee in\nterms of the sublinear regret in Section IV is weaker than the\noptimality gap in Section III \u2014 see an analytical comparison in\n13\n[16]. Nevertheless, as the effectiveness of the optimal solution\nin Section III also depends on the discrepancy between the real\nIoT settings and the modeled stationary ones, the actual online\nperformance of these approaches requires further evaluation.\nThe vantage point of this overview opens up a number of\nexciting directions for future research.\nDistributed machine learning. Considering the massive\namount of mobile devices in IoT, centralized learning becomes\ncomputationally intractable, and also rises serious privacy con-\ncerns. To date, the widespread consensus is that besides data\ncenters at the cloud, future machine learning and artificial in-\ntelligence tasks have to be performed starting from the network\nedge, namely mobile devices. This is the overarching goal of\nthe emerging federated learning paradigm [66], [67]. Towards\nthis goal, future challenges and opportunities include reducing\nthe communication overhead during the distributed learning\nprocesses, and enhancing the robustness of learning algorithms\nunder adversarial attacks. Recent advances in the direction of\ncommunication-efficient learning include the adaptive commu-\nnication mechanism in [20] that enjoys the first provably bound\non the reduced number of communication rounds. Challenges\nof distributed learning also lie in asynchrony and delay intro-\nduced by e.g., IoT mobility and heterogeneity. Asynchronous\nparallel learning schemes are thus worth investigating by lever-\naging advances in static optimization settings [14], [75]. From\ndistributed machine learning to distributed control, multi-agent\nreinforcement learning will play a critical role in distributed\ncontrol for IoT [58]. A decentralized actor-critic algorithm has\nbeen recently developed in [108] for multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning over networked agents, and further generalized to\ntasks with large continuous state and action spaces [107].\nCommunication, computation and control co-design. The\npast decade has witnessed the convergence of the commu-\nnication and computing processes [10]. The current brief is\nthat next-generation communication networks should support\nemerging large-scale control applications in IoT with mil-\nlions of diverse devices over a large geographical area. This\ncalls for co-designing communication, computing, and control\nmechanisms. The challenges naturally arise in developing the\ndesired network architecture, the role of different network\nentities, pertinent performance metrics, and the corresponding\npolicies to simultaneously satisfy the timeliness, reliability and\nefficiency of all three intertwined systems.\nOver the decades, the focus of wireless communications has\nbeen anytime, anywhere, anyone connection of the humans,\nwhereas the emerging IoT paradigm largely extends the scope\nof wireless networking to connecting everything, along the\nhumans-to-things and things-to-things continuum. The IoT\nchallenges such as extreme heterogeneity, unpredictable dy-\nnamics and massive scale, call for game-changing innovations\nin network design and management. We hope that the proposed\nunified framework can serve as a stepping stone that leads\nto systematic designs and rigorous analysis of adaptive and\nscalable learning and management schemes for IoT, and a host\nof new research venues to pursue.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Further LTE Physical Layer Enhancements for MTC.

Many facilities exist that are designed to protect critical material and human assets.  Unlike \nforward operating bases in the military encountering numerous and frequent threats, many facilities have \na low probability of being intruded or attacked, yet the consequences of such unlikely events are great.  \nMaintaining vigilance during long periods of little to no activity can be challenging.  Further, if the \ndecision maker becomes too disengaged with the state of the environment, a genuine threat such as \nphysical intrusion, cyber intrusion, and even weapons of mass destruction can highlight the potential loss \nof situation awareness (SA).  Consequently, the decision maker could take erroneous action or panic and \nlose time struggling to regain situation awareness. \nModern information sources to support force protection decision makers are diverse.  Ground, air, and \nspace-based sensors continue to increase in capability.  Information fusion algorithms can help to \nintegrate a variety of sensor data into meaningful forms [11].  However, finding a single learning \nalgorithm to address real-world applications can be difficult.  Our approach coordinates multiple learning \nmechanisms to accommodate environments where ground-truth and feedback may not be consistently \navailable.  Data from law enforcement, transportation systems, cyberspace, and intelligence offer \nadditional perspectives on the state and capability of threats.  Despite the significant and increasing \ncapabilities of advanced computational systems, it has been noted that decision support systems \nleveraging such capabilities and resources have limited value without sensitivity to the decision maker \nand their objectives [17].  At the same time, areas such as Information Operations recognize that the \nultimate target is the decision maker [2].  The current work has pursued technological capabilities for \ndecision support with the decision maker as a central and balanced element of the system. \nThe current work blends three focus areas including machine learning, information fusion, and decision \nsupport.  The machine learning components provide adaptive mechanisms for information fusion, \nsituation assessment, and the ability to continuously sense and influence the state of the environment.  \nInformation fusion offers the ability to integrate diverse data sources into meaningful and actionable \ninformation.  Finally, decision support addresses the need to facilitate objective, effective, and consistent \nhuman performance. \nInformation fusion and decision support combine to provide a situation awareness resource from which \ndecision makers can benefit.  The kinds of information used as input to the system determine the kinds of \nsituations to which decision makers can respond.  The collection, fusion, and decision support of cyber \ninformation can provide a Cyber SA capability for modern force protection network administrators.  The \ncurrent work focuses on physical protection of a facility through the use of electronic ground sensors and \nenvironmental information, but the principles employed can be applied to cyber and other SA concerns. \n1.1 Machine Learning \nMachine learning involves programming computers to optimize a performance criterion using example \ndata or past experience [1].  Artificial neural networks are commonly used in machine learning and utilize \nsupervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning approaches to achieve predictive properties based \non example (training) data.  Unsupervised learning (clustering) can be effective when ground truth is not \navailable with a dataset.  An excellent survey of clustering techniques is provided in [25].  Supervised \nlearning (learning with a teacher) provides a means to use experience (examples with ground-truth) for \ncorrectly classifying yet unseen situations.  Reinforcement learning offers promise for machine learning \nin difficult learning environments by taking advantage of sometimes crude feedback about the \nperformance of a system.  Real-world problems are rarely optimally addressed using a single learning \napproach.  Ideally, ground-truth information is available with all training data.  In this case, supervised \nlearning is used.  However, this is too optimistic for many real situations.  More often, data is available \n 8 \nwithout ground-truth, a rather pessimistic situation for machine learning algorithms supporting situation \nawareness.  In this case, unsupervised learning can still be used to offer structure to the data for a human \nto interpret.  Even without ground-truth information, hints or general feedback regarding a data set are \noften available, in which case reinforcement learning is used.  The challenge addressed by the current \nwork is to coordinate all of these learning mechanisms and utilize the appropriate one based on the \ninformation at hand. \nNeural nets offer an excellent assortment of high-performance, low-cost, distributed processing options.  \nIn particular, they can be embedded into appropriate sensors for operation at the lowest levels of \ninformation fusion with effective but low-complexity designs.  At the highest levels of information fusion \nand situation assessment, reinforcement learning can be used with a human in the loop to provide \noperational feedback.  Dealing with multiple sensor modalities and extracting meaningful information \nfrom massive datasets is a natural fit for these adaptive methods.  Although neural networks have been \napplied to sensor fusion, their use in situation awareness has been limited, possibly because of the lack of \nrich training data for this problem. \nAutomated (computational) information fusion continues to suffer from very specific, ad-hoc solutions \n(i.e., there appears to be very little general-purpose technology to apply to this problem) [14].  For many \napplications, there exists a dearth of data to use for training a computational engine.  This reveals a \nchallenge for the application of machine learning techniques, which are data-driven and require training, \nwhether via supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning.  On the other hand, because they are \ndata-driven, the advantage of machine learning techniques is that they can learn solutions to problems that \nare difficult for humans to codify with explicit rules or models.  In other words, they can represent \nrules/decisions that are implicit in the training data. \n1.2 Information Fusion \nThe fusion of information has been likened to the human ability to utilize multiple senses to derive a \nbetter understanding of a situation [11].  For example, one may hear a noise and, based on the sound \npressure discrepancy between each ear, localize the area of the sound source.  Vision can then be used to \nfurther define and understand the source of the sound.  The analogy is helpful because fusion, and more \ngenerally situation assessment, is a process rather than simply a discrete event.  The process leads one \nfrom raw data to understanding and actionable knowledge.   Fusion can occur over various information \n(sensor) modalities, over geographic space, and over time. \nThe sources of information potentially available to decision makers continue to expand in depth and \nbreadth.  Sensor capabilities in particular are maturing rapidly, but a valid concern is that the pace of \nsensor development has not necessarily been consistent with advances in human effectiveness, which the \nsensors must ultimately support [17].  Fusion algorithms will better support human-in-the-loop system \neffectiveness when the decision maker is a central and balanced design element [19]. \nPrevious research has often utilized the Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL) fusion levels [22] to explain \nhow various input (e.g., seismic sensor data) can be used to provide certain output (e.g., human on foot).  \nApplications described using the JDL model are typically military in nature but can be transferred easily \nto other domains as well.  In JDL terms, the current research focuses on supporting levels 2 (\u201csituation \nrefinement\u201d) and 3 (\u201cthreat assessment\u201d). \n 9 \nLevel\n1\nFusion\nLevel\n3\nFusion\nLevel\n2\nFusionLevel\n0\nFusion\nDatabases\n(Fusion & Support)\nSources\n&\nSensors\nLevel\n4\nFusion\nHuman\nComputer\nInteraction\nLevel\n5\nFusion\n \nFigure 1  The Data Fusion Model from the Joint Directors of Laboratories. \nIn levels such as threat assessment, there are challenging issues to address, such as adversarial intent [20].  \nInferring intent from raw data implies the filtering of some data during fusion.  If too much data is \nfiltered, the decision maker\u2019s understanding of the situation is inhibited, and, worse, trust in the \nautomated resources can be lost [15].  The loss of trust can render the entire system ineffective.  Fusion \nalgorithms must therefore determine the optimum level of fusion necessary to avoid overloading the \ndecision maker with data while keeping the decision maker sensitive to the context at hand. \n1.3 Decision Support \nAddressing the Decision Maker \nProbably the greatest pitfalls in the development of decision support systems involve gross assumptions \nregarding who will use the system and how it will be used.  The consequences of such assumptions \ninclude the late and painful confrontation of these assumptions only after significant design alternatives \nhave been implemented. Designers must either return to earlier design phases or proceed at the expense of \nsystem effectiveness.  As clearly and as early in the design process as possible, it is necessary first to \nunderstand who will be using the system.  The user should not be considered some isolated entity, but \nrather a central component in the overall system.    \nThe user is the greatest source of variability to a system.  The user consists of many characteristics that \ncan be divided into three broad categories including sensory (e.g., visual, auditory, tactile), physical (size, \nweight, strength), and cognitive (awareness, reasoning, memory, learning, decision-making).  Each \ndimension brings with it capabilities and limitations that have often been empirically established and \ndocumented.  Automated components are effective with structure and patterns and are ever vigilant.  In \ncontrast, humans are more agile, with the ability to change.  In fact, variety is desirable in many cases.  \nFurthermore, humans are capable of shaping the perception of others and detecting anomalies.  General \nweaknesses include the need for regular rest, highly variable motivation, and limited vigilance.  It is \nnecessary to be aware of such capabilities and limitations when allocating functions to either the user or \nthe hardware to facilitate human-in-the-loop system effectiveness. \nIndividual users of decision support systems introduce variation with respect to their backgrounds.  Level \nand type of education will influence the nature of performance in a system.  The level and type of \neducation with decision support systems in particular will influence performance as well.  The user may \nbe accustomed to certain resources (e.g., information, automation) in reaching decisions or in general \nperformance that could influence expectations and the acceptance of a new or alternative tool. \n 10 \nDevelopers must understand the nature of the user\u2019s task.  What are they trying to accomplish?  In the \ncase of decision support systems, the user may need to plan, such as in the development of a defense \nperimeter.  Digging deeper within planning, it is helpful to understand the constraints placed upon the \ndecision maker, including factors like time constraints and resource availability.  The user may be \nperforming supervisory control, where issues such as the level of automation are relevant.  Supervisory \ncontrol is often tied to response activities in the event of, for example, a detected intrusion.  Each task \nrequired of the user must be evaluated and designed such that the user is a central and balanced system \nelement. \nThe complexity of individuals is significant and the complexity is magnified in the context of \nmultiple/collaborative users.  Careful analysis is needed to understand the dynamics of collaborative \nbecause each collaborator brings with them the variables already mentioned.  Note also that individual \ndifferences not only vary person-to-person but also day-to-day, and it is cumbersome for many designers \nof high consequence systems to accept the fact that humans have bad days independent of training.  \nFurther, communication, authority, and shared awareness are a small sample of additional variables to \nassess in the decision support system design.  \nDecision Making \nA decision is a choice among alternatives.  It is helpful to recognize that a choice does not necessarily \nhave to result in some action that changes the environment (e.g., turning on a sensor).  A decision can \nresult in a hypothesis concerning a given situation or even an interim hypothesis in assessing a situation \n(e.g., the object may be a passenger car).  A well-documented feature of human decision making in \nnatural environments is that much of the process involves situation assessment [13].  Consequently, \neffective automated support can be directed towards situation assessment as much as decision support \nsystems have traditionally supported the exploration of possible courses of action. \nEngineered systems are commonly designed for normal and prescribed circumstances [24], but context \ndrives human performance [21].  Therefore, unexpected events involving human error highlight the \ndiscrepancy between design assumptions and reality.  Natural environments involve adaptive processes, \nagain driven by circumstances or context [13]; therefore, advanced decision support systems must \nfacilitate the adaptive processes of human-in-the-loop systems. \nAdaptive processes observed in naturalistic decision making can be extremely effective.  However, the \nutilization of incomplete information to draw conclusions can be costly as well [7]. \n2 Approach \nIn an attempt to effectively provide situation awareness for a decision maker, we have brought together \nthree focus areas of research.  An overview of these areas is depicted in Figure 2, where respective \nattributes and weaknesses are delineated.  As noted earlier, much of our approach\u2019s success hinges on the \neffectiveness of the operator.  If the approach is focused solely on the automated features, then the \noperator can become more disconnected from the tools and resources needed to assess situations and \nmake objective and effective decisions.  The functions allocated to automated processes leverage \ncapabilities that humans cannot perform effectively.  Still, the proposed approach does not control the \ncourse of action and allows the human to act at his discretion for specific contexts. \nThe fusion algorithms provide additional dimensions of perspective for a given situation and therefore \ngenerate rich input to the situation assessment algorithm.  Machine learning algorithms are at the core of \nboth sensor fusion and situation assessment.  They provide analyses that improve with training and \nadditional input.  Their output facilitates the operator\u2019s trust in the automation [10] and provides a better \ngrasp of a given situation.  Fixed rules can augment these algorithms when relationships between inputs \nand outputs are already known. \n 11 \n \nFigure 2  Conceptual overview of situation awareness approach. \n2.1 System Architecture \nThis section provides the theoretical motivation for the design of the computational engine for \ninformation fusion and situation assessment, a design that takes advantage of the diverse utility of neural \nnetworks and integrates elements of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.  While this \ndesign is pushing the envelope of machine learning research, it matches extremely well the needs of \nsituation awareness and human-in-the-loop decision support.  Key design attributes of our system include \nthe following. \n\u2022 Accept diverse inputs \u2013 binary, categorical (integers), real-valued \n\u2022 Output situation assessment with \no Probability/confidence level, \no Evidence in support of output, and \no Evidence against output. \n\u2022 Graceful performance degradation \n\u2022 Missing/noisy inputs \n\u2022 Incorporation of human feedback \nIn order to address the desired design attributes of our situation awareness system, neural networks are \nemployed for information fusion, and a Markov Decision Process (MDP) is employed for situation \nassessment.  The ARTMAP is based on Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART), a widely implemented \napproach to modeling the learning capabilities of the human brain.  Architectures based on ART have \nbeen used successfully in a variety of areas requiring a self-organizing pattern recognition neural network \n[5].  The basic ART element supports unsupervised learning and binary inputs.  Fuzzy ART is an \nextension to accommodate categorical and analog inputs.  ARTMAP supports supervised learning and can \nOBJECTIVE \nDevelop a decision-centric system that \nadapts to complex input in order to \noptimally support situation awareness.  \n PROVISIONS \n CHALLENGES \nIntegrate \ndisparate \nresources \nInformation  \nFusion \n\u2022 Optimal fusion \n\u2022 Computational \nalgorithms \n\u2022 Adaptive mechanisms \n\u2022 Probability outputs \n\u2022 Evidence of decision \n\u2022 Multiple learning modes \n \nMachine  \nLearning \n\u2022 Incomplete input \n\u2022 Actionable output \n\u2022 Coordination of \nlearning modes \nFunctions allocated \nto automated \nprocesses \nDecision  \nSupport \n\u2022 Keeping decision maker a \ncentral and balanced \nsystem component \n\u2022 Situation awareness \n 12 \naccommodate analog inputs using fuzzy logic.  ARTMAP can also support reinforcement learning, for \nexample, by adding a mechanism to implement actor-critic methods such as Q-Learning (discussed below \nin Section 2.2).  Coordinated ARTMAP (CARTMAP) is the name given to the integration of all three \nlearning mechanisms in the same architecture.  Appendix A provides an excellent introduction to, and \nsummary of, adaptive resonance theory (ART), the core machine learning element used for situation \nawareness in this paper.  This material regarding ART is taken directly from Clustering book by Wunsch \nand Xu [26]. \nThe situation assessment module of the system architecture is designed to use an MDP for sequential \ndecision making.  It receives state information from the information fusion module and possibly other \nsources as well and outputs a threat assessment or action to be taken.  A Partially Observable MDP \n(POMDP) is a crucial element for assessing a situation when state information of the environment is not \nentirely available and must be supplemented with a probabilistic description. \nThe SA/Decision Support GUI takes information from all previous modules and presents it to the human \ndecision maker(s) in meaningful and actionable ways.  Human feedback can be accepted in various ways \nto support on going learning in the fusion and situation assessment modules. \nFigure 3 shows the steps involved in situation awareness for a sample force protection application, which \nis described further in Section 3.  The Information Sources block in Figure 3 represents a diversity of data \ncollected from the world, including, but not limited to, electronic sensors.  The Information Fusion block \nrepresents a data processing step that combines various information sources.  Fusion of information \noccurs over time, space, and sensor modality.  A CARTMAP network is used to map collected data to \nobservations of events in the world.  The Situation Assessment block takes observations from the \nInformation Fusion function and provides an assessment of the current situation.  Its output includes a \nconfidence level and evidence in support of and against its assessment for presentation to the human \ndecision maker.  The SA / Decision Support GUI block represents an operator interface tailored to force \nprotection decision making.  Finally, the human operator can provide feedback to the system, providing a \nreinforcement signal for perpetual learning. \n\u2022 Temperature\n\u2022 Seismic\n\u2022 Infrared\n\u2022 Motion\n\u2022 Acoustic\n\u2022 Weather\n\u2022 Cyber\n\u2022 Radiation\n\u2022 Intel\n\u2022 Vehicle type\n\u2022 Human detected\n\u2022 Animal detected\n\u2022 Fast speed\n\u2022 Full cargo\n\u2022 Wild animal\n\u2022 Friendly truck\n\u2022 Hostile truck\n\u2022 Friendly human\n\u2022 Hostile human\n\u2022 Gather more data\n\u2022 Test sensor\n\u2022 Activate dormant \nsensors\n\u2022 Evidence\n\u2022 Assessment\n\u2022 Intent\n\u2022 Confidence Levels\n\u2022 Deploy Forces\n\u2022 Notify superiors\n\u2022 Investigate\n\u2022 Do Nothing\nRaw data is filtered into evidence to make an assessment which is displayed on a screen to aid the operator\u2019s decision-making.\nAdaptive actions\nby system or human\nThe state of the environment results in observations, which invoke actions, whose values are measured to produce rewards.\n\u2022 Truck approaching\n\u2022 Hostile or friendly\n\u2022 Normal activity\n\u2022 Normal activity\n\u2022 Vehicle detected\n\u2022 Activate sensor\n\u2022 Do nothing\n\u2022 True Positive\n\u2022 False Positive\n\u2022 True Negative\n\u2022 False Negative\nInformation\nSources\nInformation \nFusion\nHuman \nOperator\nSituation\nAssessment\nSA / Decision\nSupport GUI\nCARTMAP\nPerformance feedbackSensor commands\n \nFigure 3  Situation awareness architecture block diagram. \n 13 \n2.2 Information Fusion Engine \nIntelligent creatures exhibit an ability to switch seamlessly among unsupervised, supervised, and \nreinforcement learning as the needs arise.  However, machine learning architectures, including artificial \nneural networks, have not yet achieved this goal.  We believe that it is advantageous to develop this \ncapability in a computational framework and that the ART architecture is an excellent choice for such an \nimplementation.  In the following text, we motivate, design, and give examples of this capability using \nsmart sensors. \nA well-designed sensor fusion algorithm, like an intelligent creature, can make informed use of all three \ntypes of learning in this environment on the data set given.  Certain paths may be pre-trained prior to \ndeployment, thus granting the human operators license to verify that the most obvious sensor patterns will \nbe classified successfully.  During operation, a reinforcement signal provided either by the environment \nor by the human operator acting off of the fusion algorithm\u2019s recommendations can adjust the current \nadaptive weight profile to curtail a faulty clustering in the ART algorithm.  Finally, in the absence of any \nexternal signal, the algorithm will learn in an unsupervised manner, comparing current inputs to what it \nalready knows. \nThis approach takes the form of an Adaptive Critic Design (ACD), a class of architectures designed to \ntranslate a reinforcement learning problem into a supervised learning problem.  Our core algorithm\u2014\nARTMAP\u2014already seamlessly handles both unsupervised and supervised learning problems.  Therefore, \nthe ACD super-structure is a natural fit, given our goals.  In the core ACD paradigm, the function to be \nmaximized is the Bellman Equation. \n \n\u2211\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032+=\ns\nasJasPsrsJ ),(),()()( \u03b3\n                              \nThis is the discounted expected reward optimality criterion. In this equation, s represents the current state \nof the system, a the action to be taken, J(s) represents the current value of a given state, s\u2032 signifies the \nnext-states, P(s\u2032, a) is the transition probability matrix for the system\u2019s evolution, and a discount factor, \u03b3, \nUis applied to future rewards.  This equation is to be maximized over all actions. \nNarratively, the Bellman equation states that the current value of a state is equal to the immediate reward \nof taking an action plus the discounted future reward that accrues from that state.  Other optimality \ncriteria are possible to account for infinite horizon or nondiscounted models. The task at hand is to solve \nthis equation given an appropriate reinforcement signal. \nBarto and Sutton [23] discuss a wide variety of solution methods for these problems. Our algorithm will \ntake advantage of one solution method in particular, a member of the temporal difference (TD)-lambda \nfamily of optimization algorithms called Q-learning.  The Q-learning algorithm is presented in Figure 4.  \nQ(s,a) is the valuation of each state-action pair, t is the iteration number, pi(s) is some method of \ncalculating the next action (typically an e-greedy policy), \u03b4 and \u03b3 are learning rates, a\u2032 is the set of next \nactions, and s\u2032 is the next state. \n \n 14 \n    \nFigure 4  Q-learning algorithm for Reinforcement Learning problems.   \nNote that the Q-learning algorithm iteratively updates the value of each state-action pair.  The appropriate \nmodification is calculated based on the difference between the current and realized valuations, when \nmaximized over all possible next actions.  This is a key concept that sets the foundation for the more \nadvanced techniques discussed in the following paragraphs. \nThis algorithm utilizes a lookup table to store the Q-values for each state-action pair.  As the scale of the \nsimulation grows, the amount of memory required to catalogue these values can grow at a staggering rate.  \nA more computationally intensive version, called Heuristic Dynamic Programming, uses function \napproximators in place of the table.  However, for our purposes in this architecture, the classic Q-learning \napproach will suffice. \nWith the ARTMAP unit taking the place of the Actor in the ACD implementation, the CARTMAP \nalgorithm will behave in the following manner. Upon receipt of an unsupervised signal, the system will \nuse its exemplar classification scheme to output an action choice, as usual.  No updating of the lookup \ntable will be necessary.  When presented with a supervised signal, the internal adaptive weights will \nupdate appropriately, and the output action will be set equal to the supervised training signal.  Finally, \nwhen a reinforcement learning input signal is received, it will be interpreted according to the Q-learning \nalgorithm.  The appropriate entry in the lookup table will be augmented with the new RL value, and the \naction selected will be the one with the most value accumulated in its column of the table.  In our \nsimulations, the values of the parameters delta and gamma are 0 and 1, respectively. \nIn summary, the information fusion engine accepts raw data from sensors and other information sources \nand processes/transforms/fuses them into inputs appropriate for the SA Assessment engine.  It provides a \nmapping to a set of observations for the POMDP Situation Assessment Engine, as described in the next \nsection. \nFigure 5 illustrates the CARTMAP architecture, which uses three interdependent ART modules, one for \neach learning mode.  The three ART networks are linked together by an inter-ART module (Associative \nMemory).  One ART unit handles the inputs, another ART unit processes the supervisory (or target) \nsignal, and the other processes the reinforcement signal as an adaptive critic.  This architecture is capable \nof online learning without degrading previous input-target memories. \nQ-Learning Algorithm \n1.  Initialize Q(s, a) \n2.  Set t = 1 \n3.  Initialize s \n4.

Supervised learning is appropriate and desired for initial training on \nfixed data.  However, these two types of learning do not cover every possible complication.  There are \ntimes when the correct classification is not known by the human operator, yet some feedback on the \ndecision can be provided.  These situations fall into the reinforcement learning category.  One aspect of \ndeveloping this information fusion engine, therefore, is adding the reinforcement learning capability to \nthe ARTMAP neural network.  Figure 6 shows the inputs and learning activity of the CARTMAP \nnetwork for the three learning mechanisms as well as for standard operational use.  Available inputs to the \nsystem are shown in green, as are the active elements involved in learning/use.

Whether this is accomplished using an advanced \nneural network architecture or using a simple clustering algorithm depends mostly on the particular \nproblem statement at hand. \nA practical consideration of this work includes the need to develop field-deployable hardware capable of \nperforming intelligent sensor fusion quickly, efficiently, and with a minimum of overhead.  Using a single \narchitecture rather than a conglomeration of techniques hacked together in a computational sprawl will \nallow us to satisfy these requirements.  Once trained, ART operates quickly and smoothly and is well-\nsuited for operation on such a platform.  The next section will describe how the information fusion \nengine\u2019s output is used in decision making. \n2.3 Situation Assessment Engine \nA Markov chain is a mathematical object used in modeling the evolution of the states of systems for \nwhich all salient information for the future is embedded in the current state description (called the Markov \nproperty).  The states of a board game such as chess or checkers, for example, embody all necessary \ninformation to analyze the game moving forward.  Therefore, this system is said to have the Markov \nproperty and can be analyzed using the methods described below.  In practice, real systems of interest \noften have error in the sensor measurements and therefore do not technically fulfill the Markov property \ndefinition.  However, approximations can be made, and the use of Markov chain modeling can still be \njustified in many cases [18]. \nWhen Markov chains are used for sequential decision making, the resulting model is called a Markov \nDecision Process (MDP).  An MDP consists of the relevant state information, a set of actions that can be \ntaken at each state along with the accompanying reward or penalty, and transition probabilities, which \ndetail the stochastic evolution of the system when a particular action is taken in a given state. \nMDP\u2019s have been studied extensively and applied in such areas as inventory management [3], \ncommunications networks [18], and behavioral biology [12].  A solution to an MDP consists of a set of \nstate-action pairs that gives the best formal policy according to some optimality criterion (typically one is \nlooking for the set of actions that maximizes total expected reward).  Standard solution techniques are \navailable and well understood [18]. \nIt is not always the case that a system can be expressed adequately as a vanilla MDP.  Sometimes the state \ninformation is not entirely available, and the model must be supplemented with a probabilistic description \nof the current state.  Called a belief space, this concept is the core idea of a Partially Observable Markov \nDecision Process (POMDP).   A POMDP is essentially an MDP augmented with a set of observations \nproviding probability information for the states, and it demonstrates a richer ability to model a variety of \nsystems compared with an MDP.  For example, POMDPs have been used in dynamic price modeling \nwhen the exact demand faced by the vendor is unknown [4].  The extensive utility of the POMDP \nframework is crucial for use in the situation awareness engine described in this work. \nStandard solution methods for POMDPs work only on specific models and take massive amounts of \ncomputing power.  To avoid these problems, it is common to use a technique such as a Bayesian Filter to \ntransform a POMDP into an MDP once the observations are known.  The solution techniques for MDPs \ncan then be applied to the POMDP, and the optimal policy can be determined. \n3 Application \nWe designed our situation awareness system to operate in an environment involving distributed sensors \nand a central collection site for protection of a facility, a typical anti-terrorism scenario.  Information \nsources for our system might include seismic, magnetic, acoustic, passive infrared (PIR), and imaging \nsensors as well as weather, time/day information, various intelligence information, local/regional/federal \n 17 \nthreat levels or law enforcement bulletins, and any other information that might be relevant to the security \nof a particular facility, such as current traffic situations and health issues. \nConditions of interest to force protection decision makers include no activity, severe weather, \nunauthorized people or vehicles in certain locations, and certain types of unauthorized vehicles or humans \nwith weapons in any areas.  Actions include doing nothing, identifying the type and location of a moving \nobject (vehicle or human), commanding that sensors be turned on or off, deploying of forces, and/or \nnotifying of higher authorities.  The information sources can include binary data, such as motion \ndetection, categorical data, such as the type of day (weekend, holiday, etc.), and digitized analog time-\nseries data, such as seismic, acoustic, and magnetic energy levels. \nBefore being deployed, the system must be pre-trained with information that the human operator knows \nabout the broader (e.g., force protection) system and the application environment.  For example, if the \ndata signature of a thunderstorm is easy to demonstrate (due to specific acoustic, magnetic, etc. levels), \nthen that information can be included in the supervised training portion of the system.  The information \nfusion engine will adaptively learn many more data-observation relationships during online operation, but \nhaving basic readings pre-trained will aid in initial operation. \nWhen an intruder, be it an unauthorized vehicle or a human with a weapon, breaches the sensor range of a \nprotected facility, the triggered sensor data stream into the information fusion engine.  The CARTMAP \nnetwork then maps these data into observations.  These pairings represent novel data readings that were \nnot anticipated, which are then categorized via the CARTMAP algorithm in relation to the pre-trained \ndata. \nThe observation is then sent to the situation assessment engine, which follows the POMDP formulation to \ncalculate a probability distribution over the state space.  This information represents a confidence level \nthat the system is in any given state.  The state with the highest confidence from this calculation \nrepresents the system\u2019s choice for the current state.  All this probability information is then passed to the \nhuman operator, who uses this evidence in making a final decision about how to respond to the situation. \nAdapting online is an important element of the system and is accomplished through reinforcement signals \nthat can be back-propagated through the system in two ways.  First, if the probabilities of each state are \ntoo low, so that the human operator would not be able to distinguish the state from simple background \nnoise, then the situation assessment engine may issue a command to gather more information from \nadditional sensors.  Second, the human operator may disagree with the system\u2019s assessment of the current \nstate.  A reinforcement signal is then sent to the information fusion engine, and the data-observation \nmappings will adapt online.  Both of these reinforcement signal loops are noted functionally in the block \ndiagram in Figure 3.  This feature of the system allows it to maintain relevance in a changing \nenvironment. \nIt is an important point that the final action decisions are fully the domain of the human operator and are \nnot automated.  This system is an aid to the human; it is not a replacement. \nThe decision support graphical user interface (GUI) consists of three screens (see Figure 8, Figure 10, and \nFigure 11 in Section 3.2 for examples of these screens in an example force protection application).  The \ncenter screen is primarily imagery (i.e., from cameras, photography augmented with graphics, and/or fully \nsynthetic renderings) (see Figure 8).  The second screen displays a log of temporal track data (see Figure \n11).  The log reflects temporal features, such as how long ago an unauthorized vehicle breached a sensor \nfield and how soon another track might reach a key threshold (e.g., a fence or different sensor field).  The \nthird and most detailed screen provides track detail and assessment bases (see Figure 10).  \nThe log screen and track detail screen borrow heavily from the Tactical Decision Making Under Stress \n(TADMUS) system [16].  The TADMUS system has similar motivations to the current research in that \nmore content needs to be devoted to supporting an understanding of a given context.  In both TADMUS \n 18 \nand our SA approach, less emphasis is placed upon supporting an appreciation of possible courses of \naction. \nThe track detail GUI provides typical track parameters such as the course and speed, but significant detail \nis provided with respect to the basis for assessment.  Evidence in support of and against a given \nassessment is displayed.  The machine learning algorithms share the evidence used to derive assessments \nwith the operator.  Such an approach provides greater transparency and allows the operator to interrogate \nassessments. \nFor the example scenario of an unauthorized vehicle, the assessment could be a \u201cthreat.\u201d  Evidence in \nsupport of such an assessment includes sensor data, such as explosives detected, but also local law \nenforcement data that the license plate returns as a stolen vehicle.  Evidence against the assessment could \ninclude a relatively slow speed and the use of the vehicle for construction when there has been ongoing \nconstruction activity.  Alternative assessments are shown along with their respective evidence in support \nof or against.  \nThe operator can investigate various assessments along with corresponding courses of action.  For \nexample, a patrol vehicle is in the vicinity of the unauthorized vehicle and could be directed closer to the \npossible threat.  Further, more powerful sensors can be activated to generate additional points of reference \nand work towards higher levels of assessments such as possible intent. \n3.1 Data Issues \nA data-driven approach to situation awareness requires data that can be used to design, implement, and/or \ntest an actual system.  While our machine-learning approach requires data to train and test the system, it \ncan accommodate various kinds of data at various stages of system development.  The ideal situation is to \nhave plenty of rich data for supervised training.  This implies ground-truth information regarding all input \ndata, which is often not the case.  In fact, it is quite rare in real-world problems.  At times, no ground truth \ninformation is available with a set of data, in which case unsupervised learning can be utilized.  A middle \nground between these optimistic and pessimistic cases occurs when one has some information (hints) \nabout the nature of the data, short of full ground-truth.  In this case, reinforcement learning can be \napplied.  Since our architecture employs all three learning modes (supervised, unsupervised, and \nreinforcement), it is well-suited to address real-world problems.  However, data remains hard to acquire.  \nWe pursued several attempts at acquiring data for developing, training, and testing our SA system to \ndemonstrate an SA capability to address a problem important to Sandia. \nUmbra \u2013 Since quality training data is difficult to find for information fusion and situation awareness \napplications, one option is to generate your own data by simulating application scenarios.  One advantage \nof this approach is that virtually any condition might be simulated, including those that can be difficult or \nimpossible to create in reality.  Another advantage is that simulations can be run as many times as \nnecessary, each with slight variations if desired.  This is also difficult to achieve in real-life exercises.   \nUnfortunately, simulation capabilities for force protection applications are severely limited. \nUmbra is a Sandia-developed Modeling and Simulation Framework that allows us to collect acoustic, \nmagnetic, and seismic sensor data (energy levels and binary detections) during simulations of vehicle and \nhuman movement through a sensor field. Umbra provides a capability for gathering training data of \nsimulated force protection scenarios.  Figure 7 shows a map of the force protection scenarios executed \nwith Umbra.  The red dots are locations of sensor nodes grouped into three large and three small clusters.  \nThe blue dots are locations of a car as it traveled from the upper right of the map to the center.  Dots are \nnot removed, so all previous locations are shown.  The larger the dot, the more recent in time an event \noccurred.  The green and violet dots look like lines because they are adjacent dots representing locations \nof two different people who leave the car and walk away. \n 19 \n \nFigure 7  Umbra simulation scenario presented as a map.  \nThe problems with this approach are that the simulated sensors do not accurately reflect the physics of \nactual sensors to the degree necessary.  The other problem involves limitations in conditions (e.g., \nweather, vegetation, and animal).  Therefore, we did not use Umbra to generate training data for our \nalgorithms and to conduct virtual force protection experiments.  As simulation capabilities increase, \nthough, information fusion and situation awareness development may benefit greatly. \nRadiation Detection, DTRA TEAMS \u2013 The detection of radioactive sources entering a compound is \nanother force protection application that we considered addressing.  We acquired data for detection of \nradiation sources and conducted a preliminary analysis of its use in our research. The data consisted of \nradiation measurements and pictures of vehicles.  One can imagine a scenario in which the fusion of \nvehicle velocity measurements, rain detectors, radiation measurements, time, day, threat level, and other \ndata allow a decision maker at a gate to arrive at a confident conclusion regarding threat of harmful \nradiation entering the compound under his protection.  Real-time connection to medical databases (to \nassess nuclear medicine patients) and construction activity databases (to assess the need for soil density \nequipment) could further improve the quality of decision making. \nSNL protective forces \u2013 We interacted with SNL Protective Forces personnel for the purposes of \ninterviewing decision makers and acquiring sensor data for the development of our sensor fusion and \nsituation awareness / decision support technology. Support of this application is important and would \nprovide valuable experience for future military force protection applications.  However, access to \nsensitive data and interruption of their activity make this application very difficult to complete. \nCoordination with VPED \u2013 The Virtual Perimeter Extended Defenses (VPED) system (formerly VPS \nfor Virtual Perimeter Security) is a Sandia force protection project that employs an array of sensors \n(seismic, microwave, magnetic, acoustic, passive infrared) to detect intrusions into access-restricted areas.  \nWe discussed integrating our information fusion and situation awareness algorithms into their system.  \nHowever, their upcoming deployments made interruption to support our integration problematic.  \n 20 \nNonetheless, our algorithms and approach are very complementary with their sensor fusion needs.  \nImportantly, the availability of ground truth information is limited, making unsupervised and \nreinforcement learning necessary elements of a machine learning system. \nUniversity of Wisconsin (UW) SensIT data \u2013 A well-documented, highly usable set of DARPA SensIT \nProgram data is held in a repository at the University of Wisconsin (UW).  Although somewhat limited, \nthe data collection experiment was well controlled, executed, and documented.  It is a good data set to use \nto develop and test sensor fusion methods on realistic force protection problems. The UW data contains \nacoustic and seismic sensor readings from 23 sensor nodes distributed along three roads during vehicle \ntracking exercises at Twenty-Nine Palms.  We used this data set to conduct our SA experiments. \n3.2 Vehicle Tracking \nThe primary application of the developed situation awareness technology involved tracking of vehicles in \nthe vicinity of a facility under force protection.  A data set suitable for testing and demonstrating our \ntechnology was collected during a DARPA SensIT program in November, 2001 at Twenty-Nine Palms, \nCA and exists at the University of Wisconsin (UW) [9].  The data set consists of raw time series (acoustic \nand seismic) and binary detection decisions from 23 sensor nodes distributed along three intersecting \nroads as one of two vehicles travels along a road.  Figure 8 includes a map illustrating the force protection \nscenario, with a fence line and an Entry Control Point (ECP) providing protection for a facility on the \nNorth Road.  The two vehicles used in the scenario are a light armored vehicle (AAV) and a heavier, \ntracked transport vehicle (DW).  We developed a scenario whereby a facility under protection is assumed \nto exist along one of the roads, and binary sensor data processed by our fusion and situation assessment \nalgorithms are used to inform a human decision maker with our decision support techniques. \n \nFigure 8  Vehicle tracking scenario map.  Blue dots are seismic/acoustic sensor nodes. \n 21 \nData Analysis \nIn preparation for testing our own sensor fusion and situation assessment algorithms, an initial analysis \nwas performed on the UW data set to determine its value in predicting the location of the AAV vehicle \nduring a run (travel along a road).  The Clementine data mining work bench from SPSS was used to \naccumulate, prepare, and analyze the data. \nThe geographic vehicle test site was divided into a 10 x 10 grid (100 distinct cells).  Using ground truth \ndata, the grid location of the vehicle was calculated for each time step in each run.  The location was then \ncorrelated with the sensor node decision report (0 \u2013 no detection; 1 \u2013 detection) for each sensor node for \neach time step.  Additionally, the sensor decision reports for the previous four time steps for each sensor \nnode were included at each time step.  Therefore, the input (feature) vector consists of 23 x 5 = 115 \nsensor decision spanning a 5-step time window.  With the data thus organized for each AAV run, all of \nthe AAV runs were appended into a single data set with each record being designated as either a training \nor a testing record. \nClementine has five standard predictive modeling algorithms available (Neural Net, C5.0, C&R Tree, \nQuest, and Chaid).  Each algorithm was used with its default parameterization to provide a quick \nindication of the ability to predict vehicle location based on sensor decisions over multiple time steps.  \nTwo experiments were performed: one attempted to predict the grid location from the 23 current sensor \nnode decision reports, and the other used the current node reports and the node reports from the four \nprevious time steps.  Tables 1 and 2 show the results of this experiment.  \nTable 1  Comparison of algorithm performance \u2013 Current sensor node decision reports only.   \nAlgorithm 'Partition' Train  Test  \nNeural Net Correct 340 48.43% 291 46.12% \n Wrong 362 51.57% 340 53.88% \nC 5.0 Correct 357 50.85% 312 49.45% \n Wrong 345 49.15% 319 50.55% \nCRT Correct 333 47.44% 288 45.64% \n Wrong 369 52.56% 343 54.36% \nQuest Correct 311 44.3% 263 41.68% \n Wrong 391 55.7% 368 58.32% \nChaid Correct 317 45.16% 257 40.73% \n Wrong 385 54.84% 374 59.27% \nTable 2  Comparison of algorithm performance \u2013 Current and previous 4 node reports \nAlgorithm 'Partition' Train  Test  \nNeural Net Correct 357 50.85% 312 49.45% \n Wrong 345 49.15% 319 50.55% \nC 5.0 Correct 382 54.42% 323 51.19% \n Wrong 320 45.58% 308 48.81% \nCRT Correct 337 48.01% 276 43.74% \n Wrong 365 51.99% 355 56.26% \nQuest Correct 312 44.44% 263 41.68% \n Wrong 390 55.56% 368 58.32% \nChaid Correct 328 46.72% 269 42.63% \n Wrong 374 53.28% 362 57.37% \n 22 \n \nThese results suggest that there is an improvement across all algorithms when using historical sensor node \nreports.  However, even at its best (the results from C 5.0), the prediction barely represents an \nimprovement over a coin toss.  Extending the experiment produced an interesting synergy when using two \nalgorithms in tandem.  We used the two best performing algorithms, the C 5.0 and the Neural Net, in \ntandem.  Tables 3 and 4 show that when the algorithms are used in tandem and when they agree, the result \nis a highly accurate prediction. \nTable 3  Algorithm agreement matrix \u2013 C 5.0 and Neural Net \n'Partition' Train  Test  \nAgree 288 41.03% 247 39.14% \nDisagree 414 58.97% 384 60.86% \nTotal 702  631  \n \nTable 4  Algorithm agreement accuracy - C 5.0 and Neural Net \n'Partition' Train  Test  \nCorrect 269 93.4% 232 93.93% \nWrong 19 6.6% 15 6.07% \nTotal 288  247  \n \nForce Protection Experiments \nIn order to demonstrate the capabilities of our situation awareness system, neural networks were trained to \nperform sensor fusion, a situation assessment formula was constructed/calculated, and a GUI was \ndeveloped, all to increase the awareness of a human decision maker of the situation around that facility \nunder his protection.  The scenario consists of a virtual checkpoint partway up the north road on the way \nto a sensitive facility (see Figure 8) with 23 sensor nodes scattered along three intersecting roads.  Each \nsensor node outputs a binary detection decision at fixed time intervals (0.75 seconds in the original test \nset).  The sensor detections derive from seismic, acoustic, and passive infrared energy levels.  There are \ntwo different vehicles (AAV and DW) that make runs from one end of a road through the intersection to \nthe end of another road. The total number of runs is 40.  The direction of half (20) of the runs was \nartificially reversed to create additional data sets.  It is plausible that the information is accurately \nrepresented in these runs because the data is based on binary decisions and the ground is relatively flat so \nthat the engine speed and noise are presumably similar in both directions. \nA prominent piece of information that a decision maker wants to know is the current threat level around \nhis facility.  The threat level is a function of the location, speed, heading, and type of vehicle detected by \nthe sensor array and other variables that are independent of the sensor array, such as DHS advisory level, \nwind speed, average batter level of the sensors, time of day, and day of week. \nThe system used to produce the threat level is illustrated in Figure 9.  The system consists of three \nmodules:  1) Information Fusion, 2) Situation Assessment, and 3) a Graphical User Interface (GUI) \nfocused on human decision makers in force protection applications.  Multiple time steps of binary sensor \ndata serve as input to the Information Fusion module, which implements the Coordinated ARTMAP \nalgorithm. This introduces an element of relative time, which is a necessary component in estimating \nspeed and heading.  The output from the Fusion module consists of vehicle type, speed, location, and \nheading, each with a corresponding confidence level, and will serve as input to the Situation Assessment \nmodule. The Assessment module uses outputs from the Fusion module as well as other information, and, \nbeing designed to represent the conditions under which a Threat is defined, outputs an overall Threat \n 23 \nLevel.  The output of the assessment module will feed the graphical user interface (GUI) with a threat \nlevel (low, medium, high), an associated confidence level, a suggested response, and evidence in support \nof or against its output.  The GUI will also have access to the output from the fusion module, maps, and \nother available data, such as time, date, and environmental data. \n \n  \nFigure 9  Force protection experiment using UW vehicle data. \n \n4 Force Protection Experiment Results \nSection 3.2 introduced a force protection experiment involving a vehicle traveling along roads near a \nfacility with restricted access.  The highest level output of the situation awareness system is a threat level, \nwhich is defined in the experimental scenario to be a function of all of the available information regarding \nthe environment.  Some of this information is relatively static, such as DHS advisory levels, and some \ninformation is a real-time estimate of a vehicle attribute, such as its speed.  Conditions of a high threat \ninclude a vehicle at high speed, in a location near the facility, of a certain type (heavier vehicles are more \nworrisome than lighter ones), heading north towards the facility.  Other conditions contributing to a high \nthreat level are a high DHS advisory level, off-hours times and days, and extreme environmental \nconditions.  Experimental results of estimating vehicles\u2019 attributes with the Information Fusion module \nare presented in Section 4.1.  Two approaches to situation assessment are presented in Section 4.2.  \nFinally, decision support GUIs are presented in Section 4.3 for this realistic scenario. \n4.1 Information Fusion Module Results \nThe fusion module consists of four different CARTMAP networks, one for each fusion output (location, \nheading, speed, and vehicle type).  The output of a network will be of a categorical type or class except \nfor the confidence levels, which will be a real number.  Table 5 presents the classes for each information \nfusion network.  Note that for each network, if the input is all zeros, the output will be zero by virtue of a \nsimple rule (i.e., no learning is involved). \n \n 24 \nTable 5  List of classes and class values for each of the information fusion outputs. \nVehicle Type \nClasses \nLocation \nClasses \nHeading \nClasses \nSpeed Classes \n0:   zero input \n1:   AAV \n2:   DW  \n \n0:   zero input \n1:   West Road \n2:   North Road \n3:   East Road \n4:   Intersection \n  0:  zero input \n11:  N \n14:  NE \n13:  E \n  8:  SE  \n  4:  S \n  1:  SW \n  2:  W \n  7:  NW \n \n0:  zero input \n1:  < 10 km/hr \n2:  10-20 km/hr \n3:  20-30 km/hr \n4:  30-40 km/hr \n5:  40-50 km/hr \n6:  50-60 km/hr \n7:  60-70 km/hr \n8:  70-80 km/hr \n9:  80-90 km/hr \n10:  > 90 km/hr \n \nOut of the 40 total runs available for the force protection experiments, 30% were used for testing and the \nremainder for training.  Table 6 show the number of runs used in the six experiments.  In real-world \napplications, it is expected that the amount of supervised training data is limited.  In the force protection \nexperiments, only 2 of the 30 training runs are used for supervised learning.   \nTable 6  Distribution of vehicle runs for the force protection experiments. \nExperiment # \n# Supervised \nRuns \n# Unsupervised \nRuns \n# Reinforcement \nRuns \n# Test \nRuns \n1, 4 2 26 0 12 \n2, 5 2 13 13 12 \n3, 6 2 0 26 12 \n \nExperiments 1-3 use the same runs as Experiments 4-6, but the order of training is reversed.  In \nExperiments 1-3, supervised learning is conducted first, followed by reinforcement learning, and finally \nunsupervised learning.  Experiments 4-6 use the opposite order of learning, using the data with the least \namount of information first and finishing with supervised learning, which utilizes training data with the \nmost amount of information.  In this case, one expects the richer data sets and training modes to correct \nerrors and refine the classification performance of previous learning modes. \nFor each force protection experiment conducted, the same test set was used, consisting of 12 runs with \n1755 input/output pairs.  The performance (% correct classification) was computed based on this test set.  \nFor some sensor modes, such as speed and heading, a classification error may not necessarily indicate \npoor performance.  For example, if the ground truth heading of a vehicle is North and the fusion module \noutput is Northeast, it would be counted as a classification error even though the output is quite \nsatisfactory.  The same vigilance value of 0.89 was used for all experiments.  Results from experiments \nconducted using various combinations of learning modes for each of the information fusion outputs are \npresented in Table 7-Table 10.  In the Classified Correct (%) column of the tables, there are three \nnumbers separated by colons.  These numbers are explained in the three bullets below in the order of their \npresentation in the table (e.g., 1 : 2 : 3). \n1.  These numbers represent the percentage of test samples that have a target value that exactly \nmatches the output value from a CARTMAP network. \n2.  These numbers represent the percentage of test samples that have a target value that exactly or \npartially matches the output value from a CARTMAP network.  An exact match increments the \ntotal number of correct classifications by 1, whereas a partial match increases the number by 0.5.  \n 25 \nPartial matches are possible only with the Heading and Speed networks, where the class adjacent \nto the target class is considered a partial match. For example if the target class is N, then a \nnetwork output of NW or NE would result in a partial match.  Note that for the Vehicle Type and \nLocation networks, there are no partial matches so the first and second numbers in the Classified \nCorrect should be the same. \n3.  These numbers represent correct classification percentages of networks which have had two \npasses through the training set.  During the first pass, the reinforcement lookup table is updated \nduring reinforcement learning.  The updated table may be an advantage for second pass \nunsupervised and reinforcement learning.  Correct classification percentages are computed using \npartial matches. \nSince 54.4% of the input patterns in the test set are all zeros, correct classification percentages should \nnever be less than 54.4%. \nTable 7  Force protection experiment results for Vehicle Type. \nExperiment \n# \nLearning \nMode \nTraining \nSamples \n# \nCategories \nClassified Correct \n(%) \n1 Supervised \nUnsupervised \n462 \n3304 \n19 \n79 \n82.2 : 82.2 : 82.2 \n77.8 : 77.8 : 77.8 \n2 Supervised \nReinforcement \nUnsupervised \n462 \n1782 \n1582 \n54 \n57 \n58 \n82.2 : 82.2 : 82.2 \n79.8 : 79.8 : 88.1 \n79.9 : 79.9 : 85.9 \n3 Supervised \nReinforcement \n462 \n3304 \n54 \n57 \n82.2 : 82.2 : 82.2 \n82.6 : 82.6 : 85.6 \n4 Unsupervised \nSupervised \n3304 \n462 \n53 \n99 \n55.0 : 55.0 : 55.0 \n63.5 : 63.5 : 63.5 \n5 Unsupervised \nReinforcement \nSupervised \n1582 \n1782 \n462 \n37 \n40 \n89 \n55.0 : 55.0: 64.8 \n62.4 : 62.4: 83.6 \n66.7 : 66.7: 84.3 \n6 Reinforcement \nSupervised \n3304 \n462 \n10 \n58 \n84.2 : 84.2 : 86.1 \n85.2 : 85.2 : 88.5 \n \nTable 8  Force protection experiment results for vehicle Location. \nExperiment \n# \nLearning \nMode \nTraining \nSamples \n# \nCategories \nClassified Correct \n(%) \n1 Supervised \nUnsupervised \n462 \n3304 \n23 \n63 \n95.4 : 95.4 : 95.4  \n93.8 : 93.8 : 93.8 \n2 Supervised \nReinforcement \nUnsupervised \n462 \n1928 \n1673 \n23 \n100 \n129 \n95.4 : 95.4 : 95.4 \n95.4 : 95.4 : 96.2 \n93.6 : 93.6 : 95.7 \n3 Supervised \nReinforcement \n462 \n3304 \n23 \n179 \n95.4 : 95.4 : 95.4 \n95.1 : 95.1 : 90.4 \n4 Unsupervised \nSupervised \n3304 \n462 \n68 \n90 \n54.4 : 54.4 : 54.4 \n71.7 : 71.7 : 71.7 \n5 Unsupervised \nReinforcement \nSupervised \n1673 \n1928 \n462 \n31 \n227 \n249 \n54.4 : 54.4 : 54.5 \n54.4 : 54.4 : 63.1 \n93.7 : 93.7 : 62.2 \n6 Reinforcement \nSupervised \n3304 \n462 \n380 \n402 \n54.4 : 54.4 : 84.3 \n91.9 : 91.9 : 85.0 \n 26 \n \nTable 9  Force protection experiment results for vehicle Heading. \nExperiment \n# \nLearning \nMode \nTraining \nSamples \n# \nCategories \nClassified Correct \n(%) \n1 Supervised \nUnsupervised \n462 \n3304 \n49 \n78 \n68.2 : 69.2 : 69.2 \n65.5 : 66.9 : 66.9 \n2 Supervised \nReinforcement \nUnsupervised \n462 \n1782 \n1582 \n49 \n55 \n55 \n68.2 : 69.2 : 69.2 \n60.9 : 65.7 : 64.8 \n61.0 : 65.8 : 63.5 \n3 Supervised \nReinforcement \n462 \n3304 \n49 \n60 \n68.2 : 69.2 : 69.2 \n60.1 : 63.1 : 64.6 \n4 Unsupervised \nSupervised \n3304 \n462 \n53 \n98 \n54.4 : 54.4 : 54.4 \n60.7 : 60.8 : 60.8 \n5 Unsupervised \nReinforcement \nSupervised \n1522 \n1782 \n462 \n31 \n37 \n80 \n54.4 : 54.4 : 67.2 \n56.5 : 57.7 : 62.7 \n58.0 : 59.1 : 63.9 \n6 Reinforcement \nSupervised \n3304 \n462 \n15 \n56 \n61.0 : 67.2 : 65.4 \n61.9 : 67.8 : 65.7 \n \nTable 10  Force protection experiment results for vehicle Speed. \nExperiment \n# \nLearning \nMode \nTraining \nSamples \n# \nCategories \nClassified Correct \n(%) \n1 Supervised \nUnsupervised \n462 \n3304 \n55 \n90 \n69.7 : 78.7 : 78.7  \n71.2 : 78.5 : 78.5 \n2 Supervised \nReinforcement \nUnsupervised \n462 \n1782 \n1582 \n55 \n57 \n57 \n69.7 : 78.7 : 78.7 \n65.8 : 77.7 : 71.7 \n66.0 : 77.8 : 74.6 \n3 Supervised \nReinforcement \n462 \n3304 \n55 \n58 \n69.7 : 78.7 : 78.7 \n69.7 : 78.1 : 76.1 \n4 Unsupervised \nSupervised \n3304 \n462 \n51 \n100 \n55.0 : 55.0 : 55.0 \n58.6 : 60.4 : 60.4 \n5 Unsupervised \nReinforcement \nSupervised \n1582 \n1782 \n462 \n27 \n32 \n79 \n55.0 : 55.0 : 55.6 \n63.5 : 67.0 : 69.0 \n63.9 : 67.6 : 68.6 \n6 Reinforcement \nSupervised \n3304 \n462 \n13 \n58 \n71.3 : 78.8 : 75.7 \n71.0 : 78.5 : 77.3 \n \nThe following notes may be helpful in interpreting the classification performance results presented in \nTable 7-Table 10 (UL \u2013 Unsupervised Learning, RL \u2013 Reinforcement Learning, SL \u2013 Supervised \nLearning). \n\u2022 It is expected that performance will improve when the vigilance parameter is optimized for the type \nof fusion mode and the type of learning.  The vigilance for modes that have very distinct classes \nthat don\u2019t change much, such as vehicle type and location, may need to be different than for speed \nand heading, which have more classes and change more frequently throughout a run.  In addition, \nusing a different vigilance value for each of the learning modes is expected to improve \nperformance. \n 27 \n\u2022 Since 54.4% of the input patterns are all zeros, if a correct classification percentage of greater than \n54.4% is achieved after UL alone, then the reinforcement lookup table must have been used to \ncorrectly label some patterns. \n\u2022 During reinforcement learning, better results (higher classification percentages) were achieved \nwhen retraining was performed only when the reinforcement signal was negative.  So, the following \nsteps are taken during reinforcement learning. \no When a positive reinforcement signal is received, the LUT is updated, but no training is \nperformed. \no When a negative reinforcement signal is received, the LUT is updated, and  \n\u0001 Supervised learning is performed if the input pattern is found in the LUT (the \naction associated with the input pattern with the highest value is used as the \ntarget). \no Unsupervised learning is performed if the input pattern is not found in the LUT \nregardless of the value of the reinforcement signal. \n\u2022 RL followed by SL is far superior to UL followed by SL.  This stands to reason since RL brings \nmore information about potential class labels than UL.  When UL comes after SL, no class label \ninformation is explicitly available.  Therefore, any new ART categories that are created will be left \nwithout a class assignment and these categories will not contribute to test performance.  However, \nunsupervised input patterns that get encoded by existing categories with a class label can contribute \nto the quality of the category in representing the class in feature space.  In addition, since the \nCARTMAP has access to a reinforcement lookup table (RLUT), if an unlabeled pattern is found in \nthe RLUT during UL, then its class label can be assigned to the pattern.  Originally, the RLUT is \ngenerated from the supervised training data and it expands when new patterns with labels are added \nto the RLUT. \n\u2022 In general, user control of the machine learning process (e.g., setting the vigilance parameter) \nshould maintain the value of SL as much as possible.  In other words, once SL has been performed, \nUL and RL should not degrade, but improve the quality of the network. \nThe coordination of three machine learning modes offers potential benefit from every sample of data \navailable in an application.  However, the details of their integration are non-trivial. \n \n4.2 Situation Assessment Module \nThe situation assessment module takes as input the information from the Information Fusion module and \nany other information relevant to the evaluation of the situation in the current environment.  The inputs \nused in our vehicle tracking scenario are given below.  \n\u2022 Vehicle type, location, heading, and speed \n\u2022 Wind speed \n\u2022 DHS Advisory level \n\u2022 Average battery life of sensor modules \n\u2022 Day of week \n\u2022 Time of day \nThe situation assessment module provides the highest level information about the situation to the human \ndecision maker as well as meta-information about its assessment.  Its outputs include the following \ninformation. \n 28 \n\u2022 Threat Level (high, moderate, or low) \n\u2022 Evidence in support of the threat level  \n\u2022 Evidence against the threat level  \n\u2022 Confidence in the threat level \n\u2022 Suggested response(s) to the threat level \n \nSituation Assessment using a Weighted Rule \nThe weighted rule approach to situation assessment first transforms each input into a threat category \naccording to Table 11. \nTable 11  Threat categories of inputs used in Weighted Rule situation assessment. \nInput Range Category Numeric Value \nVehicle Location (L) \nNorth Road \nIntersection \nEast / West Road \nHigh \nModerate \nLow \n2 \n1 \n0 \nVehicle Speed (S) \n> 40 km/hr \n20 \u2013 40 km/hr \n< 20 km/hr \nHigh \nModerate \nLow \n2 \n1 \n0 \nVehicle Heading (H) \nNW, N, NE \nW, E \nSW, S, SE \nHigh \nModerate \nLow \n2 \n1 \n0 \nVehicle Type (V) \nTracked (DW) \nLight (AAV) \nAnomaly \nHigh \nModerate \nLow \n2 \n1 \n0 \nWind Speed (W) \n> 40 km/hr \n\u2264 25 km/hr \nModerate \nLow \n1 \n0 \nBattery Capacity (B) \n\u2264 50% \n> 50% \nModerate \nLow \n1 \n0 \nDHS Advisory Level (D) \nHigh, Severe \nElevated, Guarded \nLow \nHigh \nModerate \nLow \n2 \n1 \n0 \nTime of Day (T) \nOff hours \nNormal hours \nModerate \nLow \n1 \n0 \nDay of Week (DW) \nWeekend, Holiday, Special Day \nNormal weekday \nModerate \nLow \n1 \n0 \n \nThe next step is to compute the assessed threat level from a linear combination of all of the input \ncategories, weighted according to their relative importance.  \n Weighted Rule: Threat Index = 5L + 4S + 3H + 2V + W + B + D + T + DW   \n      \nThe Threat Index is then converted to a Threat Level, to be presented to the decision maker. \nThreat Index > 22:   High Threat  \n11 \u2264 Threat Index \u2264 22:  Moderate Threat \nThreat Index < 11:  Low Threat  \n 29 \n \nSituation Assessment using a Bayesian Filter \nStandard solution methods for POMDPs work only on specific models and take massive amounts of \ncomputing power.  To avoid these problems, it is common to use a technique such as a Bayesian Filter to \ntransform a POMDP into an MDP once the observations are known.  The solution techniques for MDPs \ncan then be applied to the POMDP and the optimal policy can be determined. \nOur approach leverages the laws of conditional probability given by  \n )(\n)(\n)|(\nBP\nBAP\nBAP\n\u2229\n=\n,  \nwhere A and B are events of interest.  We generate reasonable estimates of the various probabilities, \ngiven expectations about the environment and interactions.  For example, quantities such as the \nprobability that a vehicle is a threat, given that it is moving at a certain speed is set \u2018a priori\u2019.  Our method \nruns the above calculation for each of the four \u201cstate\u201d calculations and then selects the maximum of that \nset.  Further research may upgrade the efficacy of the \u2018a priori\u2019 estimates while the system runs online. \nThe weighted rule formula used in the previous section can be used to establish initial conditional \nprobabilities for the Bayesian Filter.  These are shown in Table 12. \nTable 12  Conditional probabilities situation assessment used in the Bayesian Filter. \n Loc=High Loc=Mod Loc=Low \nP(Threat = High | Loc = *) 0.779084967 0.213071895 0.007843137 \nP(Threat = Mod | Loc = *) 0.294317218 0.411365564 0.294317218 \nP(Threat = Low | Loc = *) 0.007843137 0.213071895 0.779084967 \n    \n Speed=High Speed=Mod Speed=Low \nP(Threat = High | Speed = *) 0.675816993 0.274509804 0.049673203 \nP(Threat = Mod | Speed = *) 0.314249364 0.371501272 0.314249364 \nP(Threat = Low | Speed = *) 0.049673203 0.274509804 0.675816993 \n    \n Heading=High Heading=Mod Heading=Low \nP(Threat = High | Heading = *) 0.57254902 0.308496732 0.118954248 \nP(Threat = Mod | Heading = *) 0.325275657 0.349448685 0.325275657 \nP(Threat = Low | Heading = *) 0.118954248 0.308496732 0.57254902 \n    \n Type=High Type=Mod Type=Low \nP(Threat = High | Type = *) 0.488888889 0.321568627 0.189542484 \nP(Threat = Mod | Type = *) 0.329516539 0.340966921 0.329516539 \nP(Threat = Low | Type = *) 0.189542484 0.321568627 0.488888889 \n \n4.3 Graphical User Interface Module \nThe GUI designed to provide decision support for a force protection decision maker includes three \nscreens, the Track Detail screen, the Log screen, and the Map screen. \nThe Track Detail screen (Figure 10) consists of four general sections of information.  The upper-most left \nsection provides basic track parameters that are largely generated by the fusion module.  Beneath this \nsection (titled, \u201cBasis for Assessment\u201d) are fields of information that convey how the assessments were \n 30 \nderived.  Further, there are details that show how the assessment may be invalid (\u201cAgainst Evidence\u201d).  \nSuch an approach offers some transparency that facilitates objective situation assessments.  The lowest \nsection that spans the width of the screen is a list of all tracks, including friendly forces that have most \nrecently arrived in the track cue and are available to be specified in greater detail in the screen sections \nabove.  The section on the right is generally the course of action information.  A list of possible \noperational activities by the threat is listed alongside how defense forces should respond.  A basis for the \ncorresponding defense operations is provided that conveys practical capabilities in the current context and \npossible constraints. \n \nFigure 10  Track Detail GUI Screen. \n \nThe Log screen (Figure 11) affords the decision maker temporal information.  A critical element in \nsituation awareness is time-oriented information.  Pace of events and time available to decide and act \nfacilitate situation awareness and more effective decision making.  The vertical bar in Figure 11 indicates \nthe current time (i.e., \u201cnow\u201d).  The numbers across the top are time increments and move right to left in \nthe application.  The boxes represent events or tracks and are organized vertically with respect to priority,  \nso the green box at the top is the most important event involving a track that may be approaching the gate.  \nThe green coloring corresponds to a low level threat.  The box would turn yellow for a moderate threat \nand red for a high threat.  The threat assessment is driven by the same data used to drive threat \nassessments in the track detail screen.  If the track were moving towards the gate, the box would move \nright to left, and the estimated time to reach the gate would decrease.  In this case, the decision maker \n 31 \nwould know that there are at least 28.2 minutes until the track could reach the gate.  If the vehicle were to \npass the gate, then the box would have passed the vertical bar, and the box would indicate how long ago \nthe vehicle passed the gate.  The log screen shows general event data, such as computer network \nactivity/announcements, and events that are significant for perimeter security, such as sunset times and \nhigh winds that may affect sensor reliability. \n \nFigure 11  Decision support Log screen. \n \nThe Map screen (Figure 8) should present pertinent visual information regarding the environment of \ninterest. \n5 Future work \nArguably the most immediate area of future work is in establishing principles and practices for employing \nthe three learning modes.  There are different ways of combining three modes of machine learning and \nmany options for how and when to employ each mode.  We have just touched the surface of the \npossibilities for leveraging each learning mode for highest system performance.  It stands to reason that a \nCARTMAP network can be tailored for each information fusion mode (vehicle type, speed, heading, and \nlocation).  The vigilance parameter may be different for each mode.  The vigilance may also require \nadjustment based on the type and ordering of the learning modes. \nThe core of our machine learning approach is an ART neural network.  Other algorithms and architectures \nshould be explored with the same goal in mind, that of integrating multiple learning modes.  \nReinforcement learning is a general area of research worth pursuing in the area of situation awareness \nwhere there is often not a clear win or lose outcome from which to measure success.  There are also many \nways of performing reinforcement learning, some closer to supervised learning, with stronger hints, and \nothers that provide rare, but consistent hints about the system\u2019s performance. \nThe development of a complete POMDP for situation assessment is a research area deserving more \nattention.  We have noted that it offers meaningful attributes to SA applications, but its implementation is \nnon-trivial.  The approach of using Bayesian Filtering deserves further research as does the Q-Learning \napproach.  How many iterations to use in reinforcement learning on this problem is a legitimate research \nquestion, as is how best to acquire feedback from human decision makers or the overall force protection \nsystem, either directly or indirectly. \nAnother avenue of future machine learning research is to explore the use of ensembles or bagging for \nsupervised learning [8].  The use of ensembles employs multiple \u201cexperts\u201d that train the same network \n 32 \nusing a different sampling with replacement from the original supervised training set. The combination of \nthe experts\u2019 solutions results in higher performance than the use of a single network trained on the \noriginal data set. \nAmong the many system outputs explored, such as whether the vehicle was going North, one of the most \nchallenging forms of assessments was adversarial intent [20].  An easier problem is to determine friendly \nperson\u2019s intent, and even this is challenging.  A malicious adversary that could apply forms of deception \nrepresents an enormous challenge.  Progress in this direction would be appropriate for Sandia to pursue, \nleveraging the current work, which would benefit force protection customers. \nThe malicious context represents an additional domain that could leverage the current work.  The sensor \ndata used to determine vehicle parameters in this project was assumed to be correct and trustworthy.  A \nsignificant variation in context would be sensor data that was deliberately manipulated for some strategic \npurpose.  An interesting and valuable research agenda would investigate means of performing machine \nlearning effectively despite malicious activity. \n6 Conclusions \nSituation awareness involves a host of difficult technical issues, including many regarding human factors.  \nThe human perspective played a part in every aspect of our system.  The current research integrates three \ngeneral areas including information fusion, decision support, and machine learning.  The attributes of \ncombining diverse sources of information facilitate a more complete picture of a discrete situation.  \nMachine learning algorithms provide adaptive mechanisms that more continuously assess the \nenvironment over time.  Moreover, the machine learning algorithms were selected to provide the proper \namount and kind of information fusion and situation assessment, as well as to allow human feedback to \nthe algorithms.  Finally, maintaining the operator as a central and balanced system component helps the \noverall system consistently perform effectively. \nThe coordination of the three major machine learning approaches in a single architecture, using \nARTMAP at its core, is an innovation that should prove valuable in addressing real-world problems.  Life \nmany times offers a limited amount of information with ground truth that can be used with supervised \nlearning algorithms.  More available is data with hints from the environment that can be used with \nreinforcement learning.  Almost always, data is available without labels that can be used with \nunsupervised learning.  Allowing these three modes of learning to be used in the same framework is an \nimportant contribution.  Interesting advantages emerge, however, when these three approaches leverage \none another.  Reinforcement learning can utilize supervised learning when enough information about \nclass labels is available from the environment.  Unsupervised learning can take advantage of stored \nreinforcement learning information to go beyond mere clustering.  The combination and leveraging of the \nlearning modes results in a system that is greater than the sum of its individual parts. \n7 References \n[1] Alpaydin, E. Introduction to Machine Learning.

Moore (1989) defines the \nstability of an incremental clustering algorithm in terms of two conditions: \u201c(1) No prototype vector can \ncycle, or take on a value that it had at a previous time (provided it has changed in the meantime). (2) Only \na finite number of clusters are formed with infinite presentation of the data.\u201d The first condition considers \nthe stability of individual prototype vectors of the clusters, and the second one concentrates on the \nstability of all the cluster vectors. In this sense, the algorithms discussed before do not always produce \nstable clusters, as pointed out by Moore (1989) and Grossberg (1976a). The reason for this instability lies \nin the algorithms\u2019 plasticity, which is required to adapt to important new patterns. However, this plasticity \nmay cause the memories of prior learning to be lost, worn away by the recently-learned knowledge. \nGrossberg (1987a, 1988) refers to this problem as the plasticity and stability dilemma, i.e., how adaptable \n(plastic) should a learning system be so that it does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting of previously-\nlearned rules (stability)? \nAdaptive resonance theory (ART) was developed by Carpenter and Grossberg (1987a, 1988) as a solution \nto the plasticity and stability dilemma. ART can learn arbitrary input patterns in a stable, fast, and self-\norganizing way, thus overcoming the effect of learning instability that plagues many other competitive \nnetworks. ART is not, as is popularly imagined, a neural network architecture. It is a learning theory \nhypothesizing that resonance in neural circuits can trigger fast learning. As such, it subsumes a large \nfamily of current and future neural network architectures with many variants. ART1 is the first member, \nwhich only deals with binary input patterns (Carpenter and Grossberg, 1987a, 1988), although it can be \nextended to arbitrary input patterns by utilizing a variety of coding mechanisms. ART2 extends the \napplications to analog input patterns (Carpenter and Grossberg, 1987b), and ART3 introduces a new \nmechanism originating from elaborate biological processes to achieve more efficient parallel searches in \nhierarchical structures (Carpenter and Grossberg, 1990). Fuzzy ART (FA) incorporates fuzzy set theory \nand ART and can work for all real data sets (Carpenter et al., 1991b). Linares-Barranco et al. (1998) \ndemonstrated the hardware implementations and very-large-scale integration (VLSI) design of ART \nsystems. In Wunsch (1991) and Wunsch et al. (1993), the optical correlator-based ART implementation, \ninstead of the implementation of ART in electronics, was also discussed. \n8.1 ART1 \nAs depicted in Fig. 2, the basic ART1 architecture consists of two-layer nodes or neurons, the feature \nrepresentation field F1, and the category representation field F2, whose present state is known as short-\nterm memory (STM). The neurons in layer F1 are activated by the input pattern, while the prototypes of \nthe formed clusters are stored in layer F2. The neurons in layer F2 that are already being used as \nrepresentations of input patterns are said to be committed. Correspondingly, the uncommitted neuron \nencodes no input patterns. The two layers are connected via adaptive weights: a bottom-up weight matrix \nW\n12\n={wij\n12\n}, where the index represents the connection from the i\nth\n neuron in layer F1 to the j\nth\n neuron in \nlayer F2 , and a top-down weight matrix W\n21\n={wji\n21\n}, which is also called long-term memory (LTM). \nAfter layer F2 is activated according to the winner-take-all competition, which occurs between a certain \nnumber of committed neurons and one uncommitted neuron, an expectation is reflected in layer F1 and \ncompared with the input pattern. The orienting subsystem with the pre-specified vigilance parameter \u03c1 \n(0\u2264\u03c1\u22641) determines whether the expectation and the input pattern are closely matched. If the match meets \nthe vigilance criterion, weight adaptation occurs, where both bottom-up and top-down weights are \nupdated simultaneously. This procedure is called resonance, which suggests the name of ART. On the \nother hand, if the vigilance criterion is not met, a reset signal is sent back to layer F2 to shut off the \ncurrent winning neuron, which will remain disabled for the entire duration of the presentation of this input \n 35 \npattern, and a new competition is performed among the rest of the neurons. This new expectation is then \nprojected into layer F1, and this process repeats until the vigilance criterion is met. In the case that an \nuncommitted neuron is selected for coding, a new uncommitted neuron is created to represent a potential \nnew cluster. It is clear that the vigilance parameter \u03c1 has a function similar to that of the threshold \nparameter \u03b8 of the leader-follower algorithm. The larger \u03c1 is, the fewer mismatches are going to be \ntolerated; therefore, the more clusters are likely to be generated.   \n \nFigure 2  ART1 architecture. Two layers are included in the attentional subsystem, connected via bottom-up and \ntop-down adaptive weights. Their interactions are controlled by the orienting subsystem through a vigilance \nparameter. \nAt this point, we summarize the basic steps of ART1 as follows, which are also depicted in Fig. 3: \n1. Initialize the weights as wij\n12\n=\u03be/(\u03be-1+d), where d is the dimensionality of the binary input pattern \nx, \u03be is a parameter that is larger than one, and wji\n21\n=1; \n2. Present a new pattern x and calculate the input from layer F1 to layer F2 as \n \n12\n1\n \nd\nj ij i\ni\nT w x\n=\n=\u2211\n;        (16) \n3. Activate layer F2 by choosing neuron J with the winner-take-all rule, \n \nmax{ }J j\nj\nT T=\n;      (17) \n4. Compare the expectation from layer F2 with the input pattern.

Return to step 2 until all patterns are processed. \n \nFigure 3  Flowchart of ART1. \n 37 \n \nIn brief, ART1 obtains its adaptability in terms of dynamically creating new clusters in order to learn new \npatterns or events. At the same time, the problem of instability is solved by allowing the cluster weight \nvectors to move only in one direction during learning, as clearly shown in Eqs.19 and 20 (Moore, 1989). \nMoore (1989) and Linares-Barranco et al. (1998) also discussed a number of important properties of \nART1, such as self-scaling, direct access to a stored cluster, learning of rare events, and direct access to \nsubset and superset.  \nIt is worth mentioning that, by incorporating two ART1 modules, which receive input patterns (ARTa) \nand corresponding labels (ARTb), respectively, with an inter-ART module, the resulting ARTMAP \nsystem can be used for supervised classifications (Carpenter et al., 1991a). The ART1 modules can be \nreplaced with FA modules, Gaussian ART (GA) modules (Williamson, 1996), or ellipsoid ART (EA) \nmodules (Anagnostopoulos and Georgiopoulos, 2001), which correspond to the supervised classification \nsystem known as fuzzy ARTMAP, as illustrated in Fig. 4 (Carpenter et al., 1992), Gaussian ARTMAP, \nand ellipsoid ARTMAP, respectively. A similar idea, omitting the inter-ART module, is known as \nlaterally primed adaptive resonance theory (LAPART) (Healy et al., 1993). Carpenter (2003) used a \nnested sequence to describe the relations among several variants of ARTMAP, as fuzzy ARTMAP \u2282 \ndefault ARTMAP (Carpenter, 2003) \u2282 ARTMAP-IC (Carpenter and Markuzon, 1998) \u2282 distributed \nARTMAP (Carpenter et al., 1998). \nF\n1\n Laye r\nx\nF\n2\n Laye r\nw\nj W j\n\u03c1\na\nART\na\n  m odu le\nF\nab\n Laye r\nw\nj\nab\nF\n1\n Laye r\ny\nF\n2\n Laye r\nw\nj W j\nART\nb\n m odu le\n\u03c1\nb\n\u03c1\nab\nMatch  T rack ing\nin te r-ART  m odu le\nReset Reset\n \nFigure 4  Fuzzy ARTMAP block diagram. Fuzzy ARTMAP consists of two FA modules (ARTa and ARTb) \ninterconnected via an inter-ART module. The ARTa module clusters patterns of the input domain, and ARTb the \nones of the output domain. The match tracking strategy ensures the consistency of category prediction between two \nART modules by dynamically adjusting the vigilance parameter of ARTa. \n 38 \n \nFigure 5  A hierarchy of ART1 units. The input pattern is fed in at the bottom, and the winning output is read out at \nthe top. The prototype vectors of the nodes in layer F2 are used as inputs to the next layer ART1 unit. This makes \nthe different prototypes nevertheless contain information in common. Therefore, it is possible to have a higher-layer \nART unit that has a lower vigilance threshold and can combine what were previously separate clusters. \nWunsch (1991) and Wunsch et al. (1993) discussed the ease with which ART may be used for \nhierarchical clustering. The proposed method, called ART tree, is a hierarchy in which the same input \npattern is sent to every level. The ART units in a given level that get to look at the input are determined \nby the winning nodes of layer F2 at a lower level. Thus, all nodes of layer F2 in the entire hierarchy see \nthe same input pattern, or nothing at all. This allows ART to perform hierarchical clustering in that the \nlower-level clusters will form perfect subsets of the higher-level clusters. An ART1 hierarchy with a total \nof 39 prototypes is illustrated in Fig. 5. Also, two ART-based approaches for hierarchical clustering were \npresented by Bartfai and White (1997), known as hierarchical ART with joining (HART-J) and \nhierarchical ART with splitting (HART-S). \n8.2 Fuzzy ART \nFuzzy ART extends the ART family by being capable of learning stable recognition clusters in response \nto both binary and real-valued input patterns with either fast or slow learning (Carpenter et al., 1991b). \nFA maintains architecture and operations similar to ART1 while using the fuzzy set operators to replace \nthe binary operators so that it can work for all real data sets. We describe FA by emphasizing its main \ndifference with ART1 in terms of the following five phases, known as preprocessing, initialization, \ncategory choice, category match, and learning.  \n\u2022 Preprocessing. Each component of a d-dimensional input pattern x=(x1,\u2026,xd) must be in the \ninterval [0,1].  \n\u2022 Initialization. The real-valued adaptive weights W={wij}, representing the connection from the i\nth\n \nneuron in layer F2 to the j\nth\n neuron in layer F1, include both the bottom-up and top-down weights \nof ART1. Initially, the weights of an uncommitted node are set to one. Larger values may also be \nused, however, this will bias the tendency of the system to select committed nodes (Carpenter et \nal., 1991b). \n\u2022 Category choice. After an input pattern is presented, the nodes in layer F2 compete by calculating \nthe category choice function, defined as \nFirst layer \n\u03c1=0.3  \n\u03c1=0.6 \n\u03c1=0.9 \n  \n        \nSecond layer  \n \nThird \nlayer \n 39 \n \n \nj\nj\nj\nT\n\u03b1\n\u2227\n=\n+\nx w\nw\n,        (21) \nwhere \u2227 is the fuzzy AND operator defined by \n \n( ) ( )min ,i ii x y\u2227 =x y ,    (22) \nand \u03b1>0 is the choice parameter to break the tie when more than one prototype vector is a fuzzy \nsubset of the input pattern. Particularly, the limit \u03b1\u21920 is called the conservative limit (Carpenter \net al., 1991b). Also, \u03b1 is related to the vigilance parameter \u03c1; \u03b1 should decrease as \u03c1 decreases \n(Huang et al., 1995). \nSimilar to ART1, the neuron J becomes activated with the winner-take-all rule, \n \nmax{ }J j\nj\nT T=\n.      (23) \n\u2022 Category match. The category match function of the winning neuron is then tested with the \nvigilance criterion. If  \n \nJ\u03c1 \u2227\u2264 x w\nx\n,       (24) \nresonance occurs. Otherwise, the current winning neuron is disabled and a new neuron in layer F2 \nis selected and examined with the vigilance criterion. This search process continues until Eq. 24 \nis satisfied. \n\u2022 Learning. The weight vector of the winning neuron that passes the vigilance test at the same time \nis updated using the following learning rule, \n \n( )(new) (old) (1 ) (old)J J J\u03b2 \u03b2= \u2227 + \u2212w x w w ,    (25) \nwhere \u03b2\u2208[0,1] is the learning rate parameter. Carpenter et al. (1991b) introduced a method, called \nfast-commit slow-recode, for achieving efficient coding of noisy input patterns. In this context, \u03b2 \nis set to one when an uncommitted node is selected to represent the current input pattern. \nCorrespondingly, Eq. 25 becomes  \n \n(new)J =w x ,    (26) \nwhich indicates that the input pattern is directly copied as the prototype of the new cluster. On the \nother hand, committed prototypes are updated with a slow learning rate, \u03b2<1, to prevent them \nfrom being corrupted by noise.  \n \nA practical problem in applying FA is the possibility of cluster proliferation, which occurs as a result of \nan arbitrarily small norm of input patterns (Moore, 1989; Carpenter et al., 1991b). Since the norm of \nweight vectors does not increase during learning, many low-valued prototypes may be generated without \nfurther access. The solution to the cluster proliferation problem is to normalize the input patters \n(Carpenter et al., 1991b) so that, \n \n,   0\u03c2 \u03c2= >x\n.    (27) \nThis is an extended step of the preprocessing phase.  \n 40 \nOne way to normalize an input pattern x is to divide it by its norm, written as, \n \n*\n=\nx\nx\nx\n.    (28) \nHowever, this method does not maintain the amplitude information of the input patterns. Alternately, \nCarpenter et al. (1991b) proposed a normalization rule, known as complement coding, to normalize input \npatterns without losing the amplitude information. Specifically, an input pattern d-dimensional \nx=(x1,\u2026,xd) is expanded as a 2d-dimensional vector \n \n( ) ( )* 1 1, , , , , ,c c cd dx x x x= =x x x K K ,    (29) \nwhere x\nc\ni=1-xi for all i. A direct mathematical manipulation shows that input patterns in complement \ncoding form are automatically normalized, \n \n( )*\n1 1 1 1\n,\nd d d d\nc c\ni i i i\ni i i i\nx x x d x d\n= = = =\n= = + = + \u2212 =\u2211 \u2211 \u2211 \u2211x x x\n.   (30) \nCorresponding to the expansion of the input patterns, now, the adaptive weight vectors wj are also in the \n2d-dimensional form, represented as, \n \n( ), cj j j=w u v .   (31) \nInitially, wj are still set to one, which causes uj to be set to one and vj to be set to zero. The adaptation of \nwj also follows the same rule in Eq. 25.  \nA 2-dimensional geometric interpretation of FA cluster update with complement coding and fast learning \nis illustrated in Fig. 6, where each category is represented as a rectangle. Another method that has hyper-\nrectangular representations of clusters is called fuzzy min-max clustering neural networks (Simpson, \n1993; Gabrys and Bargiela, 2000). As can be seen in Fig. 6, uj and vj in Eq. 31 are both 2-dimensional \nvectors defining two corners of rectangle Rj, which is considered a geometric representation of cluster j. \nThe size of Rj can be calculated using \n j j j\nR = \u2212v u\n.   (32) \nNote that when an uncommitted node j is eligible to encode an input pattern x\n*\n=(x, x\nc\n), the fast learning in \nEq. 26 leads to \n \n( )*(new) , cj = =w x x x ,    (33) \nwhich implies that both uj and vj are equal to x. In this situation, rectangle Rj coincides with the point x \nwith zero size. \n 41 \n \nFigure 6  Category update of FA with complement coding and fast learning. Each category j has a geometric \nrepresentation as a rectangle Rj. The shaded rectangle expands to the smallest rectangle to incorporate the presented \ninput pattern x into the cluster.  \nSuppose cluster j corresponding to the shaded area is now eligible to encode a new input pattern y\n*\n=(y, \ny\nc\n). Again, following the fast learning rule in Eq. 26, we have \n \n( )\n( )( )\n( )\n*(new) (old)\n(old), (old)\n(old), (old)\n(new), (new)\nj j\nc c\nj j\nc\nj j\nc\nj j\n= \u2227\n= \u2227 \u2227\n= \u2227 \u2228\n=\nw y w\ny u y v\ny u y v\nu v\n,     (34) \nwhere \u2228 represents the fuzzy OR operator \n \n( ) ( )max ,i ii x y\u2228 =x y .      (35) \nAs can be seen from Eq. 34, the rectangle Rj expands with the smallest size to include both the previous \nrepresentation region and the new input pattern. It is also interesting to see that if y is already inside Rj, \nthere will be no change for the weight vector and, correspondingly, for the rectangle Rj.  \nNow we turn to examine the relation between the vigilance parameter \u03c1 and the size of the rectangle Rj. \nwe have already shown, learning will occur only if the winning cluster j meets the vigilance criterion in \nEq. 24. Particularly, when the input pattern is 2-dimensional and complement coding is used, we have | \ny\n*\n|=2. Then, we can rewrite Eq. 24 as \n \n*2 j\u03c1 \u2264 \u2227y w .      (36) \nBy using Eq. 34, we have \nuj(old) \nRj(old) \nvj(old) \n1 \n1 \nuj(new) \nvj(new) \ny \nRj(new) \n 42 \n \n( ) ( )\n( ) ( )\n( ) ( )\n( )\n* , ,\n,\n,\n2\n2 (new)\nc c\nj j j\nc c\nj j\nc\nj j\nj j\njR\n\u2227 = \u2227\n= \u2227 \u2227\n= \u2227 \u2228\n= \u2227 + \u2212 \u2228\n= \u2212\ny w y y u v\ny u y v\ny u y v\ny u y v\n.        (37) \nBy combining Eqs. 36 and 37, we see that resonance will occur when the expanded rectangle meets \n \n(new) 2(1 )jR \u03c1\u2264 \u2212 .      (38) \nClearly, the closer the vigilance parameter \u03c1 is to 1, the smaller the size of the rectangles will be, and \ncorrespondingly, the smaller the number of input patterns that are represented by the cluster prototypes, as \ndiscussed previously.  \nSimilar manipulations can be applied to a more general situation with d-dimensional input patterns, which \ninfers the size of a hyper-rectangle Rj, \n j j\nR d\u2264 \u2212 w\n,      (39) \ntogether with the constraint on its maximum size, \n \n(1 )jR d \u03c1\u2264 \u2212 .      (40) \nThe discussions above can be summarized with the stable category learning theorem (Carpenter et al., \n1991b): \n\u201cIn response to an arbitrary sequence of analog or binary input vectors, a Fuzzy ART system with \ncomplement coding and fast learning forms stable hyper-rectangular categories Rj, which grow during \nlearning to a maximum size |Rj|\u2264d(1-\u03c1) as |wj| monotonically decreases. In the conservative limit, one-\npass learning obtains such that no reset or additional learning occurs on subsequent presentations of \nany input. Similar properties hold for the fast-learn slow-recode case, except that repeated \npresentations of an input may be needed before stabilization occurs.\u201d \nAs we have already seen, FA exhibits many desirable characteristics, such as fast and stable learning, \ntransparent learning paradigm, and atypical pattern detection. Huang et al. (1995) investigated and \ndiscussed more properties of FA in terms of prototype, access, reset, and the number of learning epochs \nrequired for weight stabilization. A comparison of the performance of FA and ART2 was presented by \nFrank et al. (1998).  \n8.3 Other ART networks \nFA produces a hyper-rectangular representation of clusters in the feature space, which is more suitable for \nrepresenting data that are uniformly distributed within hyper-rectangles (Williamson, 1996). When this \nassumption does not hold, the fuzzy categories may become an inefficient geometrical representation for \nexploring the potential data structures (Anagnostopoulos and Georgiopoulos, 2001; Williamson, 1996). \nMoreover, FA is sensitive to noise and has a problem of category proliferation in noisy data (Baraldi and \n 43 \nAlpaydin, 2002; Baraldi and Blonda, 1999; Williamson, 1996). Williamson (1996) pointed out two \npossible causes of the category proliferation problem: (1) both the category choice and category match \nfunctions are flat within a cluster\u2019s hyper-rectangle and (2) fast learning is performed. As a solution to \nthis problem, Williamson (1996) further suggested the Gaussian-defined category choice and match \nfunctions, which monotonically increase toward the center of a cluster, to replace those of FA. The \nobtained new ART module, in which each cluster is represented as a hyper-ellipsoid geometrically, is \ncalled Gaussian ART.  \nIn the context of Gaussian distributions, each GA cluster j, representing d-dimensional input patterns, is \ndescribed by a (2d+1)-dimensional prototype vector wj consisting of three components: \u00b5j is the d-\ndimensional mean vector, \u03c3j is the d-dimensional standard deviation vector, and Nj is a scalar recording \nthe number of patterns cluster j has encoded. Correspondingly, the category choice function is defined as \na discriminant function examining the posteriori probability of cluster j given an input pattern x,  \n \n2\n1 1\n1\nlog log ( )\n2\ndd\nji i\nj ji\ni iji\nx\nT P j\n\u00b5\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n= =\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\u2212 \uf8eb \uf8f6\n= \u2212 \u2212 +\uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ec \uf8f7\uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ed \uf8f8\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\u2211 \u220f\n,      (41) \nwhere the priori probability of cluster j is calculated as \n 1\n( )\nj\nC\ni\ni\nN\nP j\nN\n=\n=\n\u2211\n,     (42) \nwith C being the number of clusters.  \nAfter the cluster J with the maximum discriminant function is activated, the vigilance test is performed \nvia the calculation of the value of the category match function, written as, \n \n2\n1\n1\n2\nd\nJi i\nJ\ni Ji\nx\u00b5\u03c1\n\u03c3\n=\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\u2212\n= \u2212 \uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\n\u2211\n,      (43) \nwhich determines how well x matches with J in terms of the measurement of its distance to the mean of J, \nrelative to the standard deviation. \nThe learning of the GA winning cluster J includes the update of the three elements of the prototype \nvector, given as follows, \n \n1J JN N= + ,      (44) \n \n1 1\n(new) 1 (old)Ji Ji i\nJ J\nx\nN N\n\u00b5 \u00b5\uf8eb \uf8f6= \u2212 +\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ed \uf8f8 ,      (45) \n \n( )221 11 (old) (new) ,  if >1 \n(new)\n,  otherwise\nJi i Ji J\nJi J J\nx N\nN N\n\u03c3 \u00b5\n\u03c3\n\u03b3\n\uf8f1 \uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8f4 \u2212 + \u2212\uf8ec \uf8f7\n= \uf8f2 \uf8ed \uf8f8\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 ,     (46) \nwhere \u03b3 is the initial standard deviation. \n 44 \nGA is designed as a class of probability density function estimators for Gaussian mixtures, using the \nmaximum likelihood (ML) method (Baraldi and Alpaydin, 2002). The relation between GA and the \nexpectation-maximization (EM) approach for modeling mixture density was discussed by Williamson \n(1997). Furthermore, Baraldi and Alpaydin (2002) generalized GA in their defined constructive \nincremental clustering framework, called simplified ART (SART), which includes two other ART \nnetworks, known as symmetric fuzzy ART (SFART) and fully self-organizing SART (FOSART) \nnetworks. It is interesting to point out that FOSART uses a \u201csoft-to-hard competitive model transition\u201d to \nminimize the distortion error (Baraldi and Alpaydin, 2002), which makes it fall out of the category of \nhard competitive learning to which other ART networks belong. \nm\nj\nM\nj\nd\nj\nm\nj\n \nFigure 7  Example of the geometric representation of an EA cluster j in a 2-dimensional feature space. \nNoticing the disadvantage of the lack of the fast learning law in GA, Anagnostopoulos and Georgiopoulos \n(2001) proposed ellipsoid ART, which evolved as a generalization of an early ART network, called \nhyper-sphere ART (HA) for hyper-spherical clusters (Anagnostopoulos and Georgiopoulos, 2000), to \nexplore a hyper-ellipsoidal representation of EA clusters while following the same learning and functional \nprinciples of FA. A typical example of such a cluster representation, when the input space is 2-\ndimensional, is depicted in Fig. 7, where each category j is described by a center location vector mj, \norientation vector dj, and Mahalanobis radius Mj, which are collected as the prototype vector wj=[ mj, dj, \nMj].

This is, in fact, regarded as essential in the improvement of energy\nsupplies, as it enhances access to more renewable energy usage at the household and community\nlevels, which will also help with energy saving and CO2 emission reduction.\nEnergy management can be defined as the conservation, control, and monitoring of energy\nin a smart grid. The main focus of this book is the investigation of the best energy management\nsystems within micro-grids, households, and communities, in order to share energy in a very efficient\nway. The security and sustainability of smart grids are also discussed in this book. Three different\nenergy sources will be discussed in this book: first, the energy generated and distributed by the\nutility, representing the main source of electricity to consumers; second, energy storage devices,\nwhich include battery storage, electric vehicles, and large-scale energy storage, where customers or\nthird-party energy producers can store energy from the utility grid during lower price periods and\nuse it during higher price periods; thirdly, renewable energy that is generated from natural sources,\nwhich are continuously replenished, thereby creating relative or total energy independence from the\ngrid for customers.\nSmart energy management can be carried out at two levels: household and community or\nhousehold groupings. At the household or smart homes level, an energy management system should\nbe installed according to consumer type and demand. Each consumer should be able to optimise\nits energy consumption and trading for comfort and profit. The energy management system can\nalso offer smart, active consumers incentives above passive, smart consumers. Consumers should\nmanage their internal energy from utility, storage and renewables. A smart energy management\nsystem should take control of these energy sources in order to maintain better consumption. At\nthe community level, sharing available energy between households will help create a kind of\nindependence that will help to sustain the grid.\nThis Book on \u201cSmart Energy Management for Smart Grids\u201d opens the door to research on\nthe importance of developing smart energy management systems by designing smart techniques,\nmathematical approaches, and algorithms, in order to take control of energy consumption in smart\nhomes and community households. The sharing of energy in a community can be modelled in a\nmathematical way, as in the case of many applications using game theory to create a demand\u2013offer\nequilibrium that helps to manage and balance energy consumption.\nKhmaies Ouahada, Omowunmi Mary Longe\nSpecial Issue Editors\nix\n\nsustainability\nArticle\nReal Time Security Assessment of the Power System\nUsing a Hybrid Support Vector Machine and\nMultilayer Perceptron Neural Network Algorithms\nOyeniyi Akeem Alimi 1,*, Khmaies Ouahada 1 and Adnan M.

Any intrusive action on the power system\u2019s Optimal Power Flow\n(OPF) modules can cause a series of operational instabilities, failures, and financial losses. Real time\nintrusion detection has become a major challenge for the power community and energy stakeholders.\nCurrent conventional methods have continued to exhibit shortfalls in tackling these security issues.\nIn order to address this security issue, this paper proposes a hybrid Support Vector Machine and\nMultilayer Perceptron Neural Network (SVMNN) algorithm that involves the combination of Support\nVector Machine (SVM) and multilayer perceptron neural network (MPLNN) algorithms for predicting\nand detecting cyber intrusion attacks into power system networks. In this paper, a modified version\nof the IEEE Garver 6-bus test system and a 24-bus system were used as case studies. The IEEE\nGarver 6-bus test system was used to describe the attack scenarios, whereas load flow analysis was\nconducted on real time data of a modified Nigerian 24-bus system to generate the bus voltage dataset\nthat considered several cyberattack events for the hybrid algorithm. Sising various performance\nmetricion and load/generator injections, en included in the manuscriptmulation results showed the\nrelevant influences of cyberattacks on power systems in terms of voltage, power, and current flows.\nTo demonstrate the performance of the proposed hybrid SVMNN algorithm, the results are compared\nwith other models in related studies. The results demonstrated that the hybrid algorithm achieved a\ndetection accuracy of 99.6%, which is better than recently proposed schemes.\nKeywords: multilayer perceptron neural network; support vector machine; cyberattacks; optimal\npower flow; smart grid security; intruder detection system\n1. Introduction\nIn recent times, rapid developments in technology have increased the rate of cyberattacks\nand cybercrimes on cyber-physical systems and institutions. Infrastructural security against these\ncyberattacks and cybercrimes have become increasingly important to individuals, organizations, and\nresearch centers. In a 2016 Global Economic Crime survey, cybercrime was ranked as the fourth most\nreported economic crime in South Africa, and the rate increased from 26% to 32% when compared to\nthe reported cases in 2014 [1]. With regards to power systems and the electricity grid, the integration of\nthe Internet of Things (IoT) and other technological tools have assisted in promoting grid efficiency and\neffectiveness. However, just like other important infrastructures, a plethora of new security concerns,\nsuch as cyberattacks, are becoming rampant on the power grid [2]. Moreover, the fact that the power\ngrid is a vital asset among the country\u2019s various infrastructures makes it a highly attractive target for\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3586; doi:10.3390/su11133586 www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability1\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3586\ncyber-threats [2,3]. In the 2014 fiscal year, the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response\nTeam (ICS-CERT) announced that 79 of the 245 recorded cyber incidents on critical infrastructures\ntargeted the energy sector [4]. Severe cyberattack examples, such as the Ukrainian power grid blackout\nin 2015 and the Israeli power grid in 2016, have shown that grid cyber-security is among the top\npriorities of national security [3,5]. Studies have shown that supervisory control and data acquisition\n(SCADA) systems, and other operational modules, including the State Estimation, Optimal Power\nFlow (OPF) can be successfully attacked [6\u20138]. Intruders take advantages of the various vulnerabilities\nin the grid network and modules to disrupt grid operation and stability, thereby causing blackouts\nand economic loss. These security issues have continuously necessitated attention from power system\nengineers and researchers into developing solutions.\nIntruder detection schemes have been identified as a security solutions for power systems [3,9].\nIntrusion detection systems (IDSs) in network processes aim to monitor, analyze, and react to any\nunauthorized and anomalous deviation from the normal profile of the network. Monitoring power\nsystem networks and module results in order to predict and detect intrusion and anomalies into the\ngrid topology, database, and network data by adversaries is highly important for a reliable power\nsystem network. In recent times, various studies have proposed several formulations that focus on\nintrusion and anomaly detection for power systems [10\u201315]. The authors in [9,10] proposed an anomaly\ndetection and correlation algorithm for substation cybersecurity using test systems as case studies.\nFurther, machine learning techniques have been proposed as a viable option, as they are known to\nshow tremendous performance in intrusion detections because of their accurate pattern recognition\nand learning abilities [16\u201318]. The authors in [16] ascertained that the machine learning approach is\napplicable to power system security. The authors successfully applied machine learning algorithms,\nincluding OneR, random forest, and Adaboost+JRipper, in classifying power system disturbances over\na three-class (Attack, Natural Disturbance, and No Event) scheme. The authors in [18] developed\ndifferent multi-model algorithms in order to find the best performer for voltage security monitoring and\nassessment. The authors used the IEEE 96 reliability test system as a case study and presented Random\nForest as the best performer, with an accuracy of 99.89%. The authors in [19] proposed an artificial\nneural network algorithm (ANN) to detect power system cyberattacks on transmission network data.\nThe authors evaluated their experiments on a 24-bus system and achieved a detection rate of 92\u201399.5%\non the introduced anomalies. However, the consideration of scalability, demand, and generation\nuncertainty, which are highly common for power systems, were not considered. Further, the authors\nin [17] used some machine learning algorithms, involving a convolutional neural network, K-nearest\nneighbor, and XGBoost, to analyze raw data logs collected by phasor measurement units (PMUs) to\ndetect intrusion into power systems. The authors achieved an average accuracy, precision, recall and F1\nscore of 0.9391, 0.938, 0.936, and 0.935 on 15 datasets, respectively. The authors in [2] also presented an\nIDS based on principal component analysis (PCA), whereby flow results are monitored and intrusion\ndue to cyberattacks on transmission line parameters are detected. The authors used PCA to separate\npower flow variability into regular and irregular subspaces. They verified the performance of their\nalgorithm using IEEE 24-bus and 118-bus reliability test systems and achieved good results. However,\nintrusions on several other input data such as the load, generator inputs, and network topology were\nnot considered in their work. Furthermore, the authors in [20] presented a graph matching approach\nfor power systems. The authors used IEEE 24-bus, 30-bus, and 118-bus benchmark test systems to\nimplement their proposed scheme and achieved perfect scores. However, the proposed algorithm only\nconsidered the topological and configurational aspect of the power system database; intrusions into\nthe power flow analysis were not considered.\nWe sought to improve the shortcomings in the above-mentioned literature, such as scalability,\ndemand, and generation uncertainty, and topological and configurational intrusion of the power\nsystem. In this paper, a hybrid Support Vector Machine and Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network\n(SVMNN) algorithm, which involves a combination of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and feedforward\nMultilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MPLNN) algorithms, is developed for predicting and detecting\n2\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3586\npower system cyber intrusion attacks. The key idea is to take advantage of two distinguished classifiers\u2019\nabilities for predicting and detecting attacks on power systems. The logistic regression method is\ndeveloped for the stacking process. The hybrid algorithm is modelled to evaluate a case study involving\na 24-bus system AC power flow result dataset. This study made use of a real time generator and load\ndata injections that showed the nonlinearity and uncertainty properties peculiar to power systems.\nDaily generator output profiles for a duration of twenty one (21) days and a load profile taken at an\ninterval of thirty (30) minutes were used. The hypothesis is that at the end of each day, there will\nbe ten (10) intrusive events involving simultaneous attacks, as described in [9]. The hypothesis of\nten daily intrusive events was considered in order to have a balanced dataset for the prediction and\ndetection algorithm. Feedforward MLPNN are known for their excellent learning abilities, especially in\nnon-linear complex relationships and their good classification performance. With regards to its\nwell-known flaw of non-optimal separation surfaces between classes, here, MLPNN is stacked with\nSVM, which is excellent in that regard. Further, unlike previous studies, the proposed scheme in this\npaper considered intrusions that affect the topological configuration, as well as intrusions on the load\nand generator output injections. High efficiency in precision and accuracy were achieved using the\nproposed scheme.\nThe specific novelties of this paper are stated briefly: (1) a description of power system cyber\nintrusion scenarios, involving topological modification and polluted data using a bus test system as\na case study; (2) evaluating the effects of cyber intrusions on the AC power flow result of OPF and\nits relevant influences on voltage, power, and current flows; (3) load flow analysis using modified\npower system data and integrating various attack scenarios involving topological manipulation and\nload/generator injections; and (4) developing an effective hybrid scheme that involves taking advantage\nof two distinguished classifiers\u2019 abilities to evaluate the bus voltage dataset generated from the load\nflow results.\nIn this paper, two test bus systems were used as case studies. A modified IEEE Garver 6 bus\ntest system was used in describing cyber intrusion scenarios, whereas a 24-bus system was used as\nthe case study for the hybrid SVMNN prediction and detection scheme. The developed SVMNN\nalgorithm presented 99.6% precision and accuracy rates in predicting and detecting the introduced\nattacks, which demonstrated the efficacy of the model in predicting and detecting both topological\nconfigurational intrusion as well as intrusions into the generator and load injections. All the simulations\nto generate the bus voltage dataset were conducted using the Electrical Transient Analyzer Program\n(ETAP) software. The ETAP was used to run the AC OPF processes, and the machine learning\nalgorithms were designed, tested and evaluated using the Orange machine learning tool.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the Materials and Methods while\nSection 3 presents the results and discussions. Section 4 presents the conclusions and recommendation\nfor future work.\n2. Materials and Methods\nIn this section, we describe the OPF processes and the mathematical formulations we used to\ngenerate our voltage dataset from the raw network data. We also discuss the methods used to develop\nthe hybrid model and the case studies. All the simulations used to generate the voltage log dataset\nwere generated using ETAP, while the classifiers\u2019 algorithms were implemented using the Orange\nmachine learning tool. Both software packages were implemented on a 64-bit PC using an Intel Core\ni5-3340, 3.10 GHz CPU, with a total amount of 8.00 GB of RAM installed. In Section 2.1, we briefly\ndiscuss the optimal power flow, and in Section 2.2, we explain the mathematical formulations used in\nthe paper. In Section 2.3, we discuss the prediction and detection model developed, and in Section 2.4,\nwe present the case studies.\n3\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3586\n2.1. Optimal Power Flow\nOPF modules are very vital in the operational decisions of the grid. They defines the steady state\noperation point, whereby the minimum generating cost is assured, and system operating constraints\non quantities, such as real and reactive power, generator outputs, line flows, and voltage magnitudes,\nare maintained [2,19,21]. Grid control centers run multiple instances of the OPF module over regular\ntime intervals so as to maintain the operational cost of the power system while ensuring its reliability\ndespite variations in load requirement and available resources. It should be noted that some parameters\nand quantities, including line parameters and network topology, typically remain unchanged over\ntime, unlike quantities like the load and the power dissipated by the generating units, which change\noften. Power flow equations can be determined through either AC or DC power flow calculations.\nAny error, wrong decision, or actions caused by an intrusion of the OPF modules can cause a series of\noperational failures, technical system instability, and huge financial losses.\nKirchhoff\u2019s law explains the theory of how power flows in an electrical network [22]. Using the\nnode-voltage analysis explained in [22], provided the voltage outputs from the generating units,\nthe load impedances, transmission line impedances, and susceptances for a network are given,\nthe current and power flowing through the network can be computed. The current-voltage flow\nequation (IV equation) is derived in terms of the network admittance matrix, the current, and the\nvoltage magnitudes. The network admittance matrix for an n-bus system has a relationship with the\ncurrent matrix and voltage magnitude vector as presented in (1) [22]:\n\u239b\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d\nI1\nI2\n...\nIn\n\u239e\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n=\n\u239b\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d\nY11 Y12 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Y1n\nY21 Y22 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Y2n\n...\n... \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ...\nYn1 Yn2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Ynn\n\u239e\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239b\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d\nV1\nV2\n...\nVn\n\u239e\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n(1)\nwhere Y is the bus admittance matrix. The bus admittance matrix is given as Y = G + jB [23,24].\nThe current vector is defined in (2), whereas (3) defines the voltage magnitude vector [22]:\nIn = [I1, I2 , . . . ., In]\nT (2)\nVn = [V1, V2 , . . . . .Vn]\nT. (3)\nThe state vector X for the n node system is given in terms of the voltage magnitude and voltage\nphase angle in (4) [25]:\nX = [V1V2V3 . . . . . .Vn \u03b82\u03b83 . . . . . . \u03b8n\u22121]T (4)\nwhere \u03b8 is the n \u2212 1 dimensional vector representing voltage phase angle and V is the n-dimensional\nvector representing voltage magnitudes.\nFrom the PV flow equations, the complex apparent power injection (+ve) or withdrawal (\u2212ve)\nfrom bus n is defined in terms of p, q, and V as given in (5) [25]:\nsn = pn + jqn = VnIn\u2217. (5)\nEquations (6) and (7) express the current and voltage magnitude at bus n, respectively, in complex\nform as:\nIn = [Irn + jI\nj\nn] (6)\nVn = [Vrn + jV\nj\nn] (7)\nand substituting (6) and (7) into (5),\nsn = VnIn\u2217 = (Vnr + jVn j)\u00b7(Inr \u2212 jIn j). (8)\n4\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3586\nThe real and reactive power from (5) is expressed in (9) as:\npn = Vnr\u00b7Inr + Vn j\u00b7In j and qn = Vn j\u00b7Inr \u2212Vnr\u00b7In j. (9)\nNote that j as a superscript refers to a complex number imaginary part, while r as a superscript\nrefers to the real part. In terms of phasor angles, the real and reactive power at bus n can be expressed\nas (10) and (11), respectively [12,23,26,27]:\npn = vn\n\u2211\nn\u2032\u2208N\nvn\u2032(Gnn\u2032 cos(\u03b8nn\u2032) + Bnn\u2032 sin(\u03b8nn\u2032)) (10)\nqn = vn\n\u2211\nn\u2032\u2208N\nvn\u2032(Gnn\u2032 sin(\u03b8nn\u2032) \u2212 Bnn\u2032 cos(\u03b8nn\u2032)) (11)\nwhere Ynn\u2032 = Gnn\u2032 + jBnn\u2032 is the line admittance between two buses n and n\u2032 and \u03b8nn\u2032 is the difference\nin phase angle between buses n and n\u2032. The real and reactive power flowing from bus n and n\u2032 is given\nin (12) and (13), respectively as [6,12,27]:\npnn\u2032 = v2n(gsn + gnn\u2032) \u2212 vnvn\u2032(gnn\u2032 cos\u03b8nn\u2032 + bnn\u2032 sin\u03b8nn\u2032) (12)\nqnn\u2032 = \u2212v2n(bsn + snn\u2032) \u2212 vnvn\u2032(gnn\u2032 sin\u03b8nn\u2032 \u2212 bnn\u2032 cos\u03b8nn\u2032) (13)\nwhere gsn + jbsn is the shunt branch admittance at bus n. The net apparent equation in (7) for bus n can\nbe rewritten as (14):\nsn = pn + jqn =\n{\n(pGn \u2212 pDn ) + j(qGn \u2212 qDn ), n \u2208 seto f gens,\n\u2212pDn \u2212 jqDn , otherwise, (14)\nwhere pGn and qGn are defined as the controllable power injections/control input u. The power consumed\nat bus n, pCn , is related to the power flows of the lines connected to the bus n, as shown in (15):\npCn =\n\u2211\nk\u2208K\npLk,in \u2212\n\u2211\nk\u2208K\npLk,out \u2200k \u2208 K (15)\nwhere Lk,in and Lk,out represent set of incoming and outgoing lines of bus n, respectively, while the\npower flow via line k is denoted as pLk . The power consumed at bus n is related to the load power\ndemand and power injection into the bus as expressed in (16):\npCn = p\nD\nn \u2212 pGn \u2200n \u2208 N (16)\nwhere pDn and pGn are the load power demand and generated power at bus n, respectively.\n2.2. Mathematical Formulation\nOPF allows operators to specify a range of optimization criteria and some objective functions on\nquantities, including bus voltages and line flow. A mixed integer nonlinear programming problem\nAC OPF is formulated in the paper. There is an objective, and some constraints, that govern system\nperformance. The objective is to find steady state operating points in terms of both state vectors and\ncontrol inputs, whereby the power generated by the existing generators are optimally controlled to\nserve the load requirements and line flows in the network and minimize real and reactive power\nloss in the network. The objective function is subjected to the equality and inequality constraints in\n(17)\u2013(21) [27,28]: \u2211\nn\u2208N\npDn \u2212\n\u2211\nn\u2208N\npGn \u2212\n\u2211\nk\u2208Ln,in\npLk +\n\u2211\nk\u2208Ln,out\npLk = 0 (17)\n5\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3586\n\u2212 pL, maxk \u2264 pLk \u2264 pL, maxk \u2200k \u2208 K (18)\n0 \u2264 pG,n \u2264 pG,maxn \u2200n \u2208 N (19)\n\u03c0 \u2264 \u03b8n \u2264 \u03c0 \u2200n (20)\n\u03b8Rn = 0; Rn : re f erence node. (21)\nThe power balance equation to be solved is given in constraint (17), which gives the assurance\nthat, at any node n, the summation of the total power dissipated by the generating unit n equals the\nsummation of the power flowing in the lines and the total sum of the power demand. Constraint (18)\ndefines the power flows via the lines, and the constraint limits the power flows via the lines within\nthe network, with regards to their capacities. Constraint (19) is for the generator outputs\u2019 limits and\nensures that the generator outputs\u2019 limits are not surpassed. The voltage phase angle limit constraint\nis shown in (20) and ensures that voltage angle limits are within the specified range. Constraint (21) is\nthe constraint for the reference bus/node. Equation (21) ensures that the reference node has a voltage\nangle of 0 degrees [28].\n2.3. Prediction and Detection Model\nIn this subsection, we describe the MLPNN, the SVM, and the hybrid SVMNN models that were\nemployed in predicting and detecting the possibility of the power system network being compromised.\n2.3.1. Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLPNN)\nMLPNN is a feedforward neural network that uses backpropagation for its training process.\nNeural Network (NN) models are inspired and designed in a similar fashion to the human brain.\nHowever, unlike the brain, NNs utilize some mathematical functions that map input data to produce\nthe output. A neural network operates in such a way that when data are presented at the input layer,\nthe neural nodes (which are interconnected via respective weights and bias for each connections) execute\nsome calculations using activation functions in all the successive layers until the input data reach the\noutput nodes that produce the outputs. Typical activation functions used in neural networks include\nthe sigmoid function and the Rectified linear units (ReLu), defined in (22) and (23), respectively [29]:\nf (x\u2032) = 1\n1 + e\u2212x\u2032\n(22)\nR(x\u2032) = max(0, x\u2032) (23)\nBuilding a neural network algorithm begins with the simplest form, a \u2018single perceptron\u2019.\nA perceptron is made up of a single McCulloch-Pitts neuron, which has modifiable weights and\nbias [30]. Figure 1a presents a perceptron process [30]. To create a multilayer perceptron, the perceptron\nis modified in such a way that it includes several layers of neurons with nonlinear activation functions,\nmaking it highly potent, as it can be implemented for nonlinear separable data. Considering the\narchitectural model of a typical MLPNN presented in Figure 1b [31], the MLPNN has n inputs,\none hidden layer with z\u2032 hidden neural nodes, and y output nodes.\nLet us assume we have input data that is defined with the matrix [32]:\nr = (r1, r2, . . . . . . . ., rn). (24)\nLet us make the assumption that a vector r1 that belongs to a class of the y output classes denotes\nthe n feature values of case i\u2019. Assuming \u03b1g denotes the lower boundary limit and \u03b2g denotes the upper\nlimits of feature g, which equally relates to the minimum and maximum threshold values achievable\n6\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3586\nfor feature g, the mapping of the z\u2032 hidden layer neural node feedforward MLPNN process can be\ndefined as [32]:\nN :\n{\n[\u03b11, \u03b21], [\u03b12, \u03b22], . . . . ., [\u03b1n, \u03b2n]\n}\u2192 [\u03b3, \u03b7]y : = N(r) = f (wj f (wir\u2212 bi) \u2212 bj) (25)\nwhere wi is the weight matrix that connects n input nodes to the z\u2032 hidden layer neural nodes, and wj\nis the weight matrix that connects the z\u2032 neural nodes to output nodes y. Bias vectors bi and bj connect\nto the hidden and output layers, respectively. The function f : Rdim(a) \u2192 [\u03b3, \u03b7]dim(a) defines the\nactivation function that is fitted into individual nodes of the hidden layer\u2019s activation vector a, with \u03b3\nand \u03b7 being the lower and upper bounds. Each element in vector denotes the activation of each output\nlayer node. Hence, classification is done based on the function class, which depends on the returned\nindex of the maximum element in vector o.\n \n(a) \n \n(b) \nFigure 1. Neural Network models: (a) perceptron process; (b) multilayer perceptron neural network.\n2.3.2. SVM Classifier\nSVM is a dominant tool that is used in classification and regression problems. SVM was\noriginally proposed for binary classifications, whereby the width of the margin between the two classes\ndefines the optimization criterion. SVMs create a single hyper-plane, or sets of hyper-planes, in a\nhigh-dimensional feature space, which optimally separates the training patterns according to their\nclasses. The efficient implementation of SVMs depends on the trade-off constant C and the kernel\nfunction K type, especially when it is required for nonlinear classification. Typical kernel functions\ninclude the linear, polynomial, sigmoid, and radial basis kernel function (RBF). The trade-off constant\nC is the soft margin parameter, which influences each individual support vector. Figure 2 [33] presents\na linear SVM model showing the hyper-plane separation between the two classes.\nFigure 2. Support vector machine (SVM) hyper-plane separation of two class datasets.\n7\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3586\nAs shown in Figure 2, the model presents the examples as space points, plotted such that the\ncategories are kept apart by a distinct gap. Afterwards, new examples are plotted into the same space\nand predicted as either class depending on the side of the gap in which it is categorized.\nLet us assume we have training data of n points (\n\u2192\nx1, y1), . . . . . . . . ., (\n\u2192\nxn, yn), where point xi is a\np-dimensional vector and yi = \u00b11 labels the class to which point xi belongs. SVMs tend to locate the\nmaximum margin hyper-planes that split the group of points where xi is for yi = +1 from the groups\nwhere it is yi = \u22121 [16]. The hyper-plane for the set of points \u2192x satisfies the equation \u2192w.\u2192x \u2212 b = 0,\nwhere\n\u2192\nw is the normal vector to the hyper-plane and b is the displacement term that determines the\ndistance between the hyperplane and the origin [17].\n2.3.3. Proposed Hybrid SVMNN\nHybrid learning methods are a process of combining two or more learning algorithms. This process\nis essential in achieving better accuracy and detection rates. A simplified flowchart of the hybrid\nSVMNN model is presented in Figure 3.\nFigure 3. Flowchart of the Hybrid Support Vector Machine and Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network\n(SVMNN).\nTo evaluate the hybrid model\u2019s performance, it is required to have a sufficient experimental\ndataset with sensitive information for the algorithm\u2019s training and testing analysis. This is important\nfor the effective performance of the algorithm. In this paper, bus voltage logs are captured as a\ndataset for the intrusion detection algorithm performance evaluation. The power system dataset used\ncontains a total of 1218 training and testing dataset instances, with 24 features having binary targets.\nThe scale and distribution of the dataset can produce a significant influence on the algorithm prediction\nand detection success. It should be noted that the bus voltage dataset that contains the poisoned\ndatasets and the good datasets are combined and randomly split into two sets: the training and testing\ndatasets. From the randomly organized data, 975 of the data samples were devoted to training, which is\nequivalent to approximately 80% of the dataset, whereas the remaining 20%, equaling 243 data samples,\nwere dedicated to testing the trained model. The preprocessing stage of datasets, which includes\ntransformation, normalization, discretization, and feature selection processes, are highly important\nfor the efficiency of the machine learning algorithm. The feature selection process can vary based on\nthe type of dataset being used. Since the dataset used in this paper uses numeric data, the data do\nnot need any transformation. However, the dataset was normalized using the min-max scaling for\neffectiveness. For the developed hybrid model, the stacking utilized a back propagation MLPNN with\nthree hidden layers of 30 neural nodes each. The L2 regularization parameter assists in reducing the\ngeneralization error as well as the overfitting problem. We varied the values of the L2 regularization\nparameters in order to achieve the best possible result from our developed MLPNN. Further, this study\nemployed ReLu as the activation functions for the hidden layers. An Adam gradient-based optimizer\nwas used as the solver for weight optimization. For the SVM, this study implemented the Library for\n8\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3586\nSupport Vector Machines (LibSVM) package. The Cost C was chosen as 1.2. Three kernel functions\n(linear, polynomial, and RBF) were tested in order to find the best performer for our developed model.\nThe gamma constant in kernel function was set at 0.25. This study used logistic regression for the\nstacking. The performance of the hybrid algorithm is evaluated and compared with the performance\nof individual classifiers (SVM and MLPNN) using a machine learning key performance indicator (KPI)\nconfusion matrix. Popular classification performance measures, including precision, recall, and F1\nscore, will also considered for the evaluation. The metrics are discussed briefly [34,35]:\n\u2022 Confusion Matrix\nConfusion matrix refers to a table that is often used to explain and understand the performance of\na classification model. The model evaluation metrics from a binary classifier confusion matrix typically\nhave two dimensions: The actual class usually indexes one of the dimensions, whereas the other\ndimension is indexed by the classifier prediction.\n\u2022 Precision\nPrecision presents how often the classifier model is correct. High precision correlates to a low\nfalse positive rate. Mathematically, precision is defined in (26) [34]:\nPrecision = TP/(TP + FP) (26)\nwhere TP is the rate of true positives, defined as the correctly identified positives from the classifier\nmodel, and FP is the rate of false positives, which is defined as negative cases that have been wrongly\nidentified/classified as positive ones.\n\u2022 Recall (Sensitivity)\nRecall is the measure that describes the ability of a prediction model to pinpoint cases of a\nparticular class from a dataset. Mathematically, recall is defined in (27) [34]:\nRecall = TP/(TP + FN) (27) (27)\nwhere FN is the rate of false negative observations.\n\u2022 F1 Score\nF1 score is the harmonic average of Precision and Recall. The F1 score is considered to be a better\nmetric compared to accuracy, especially in a classification involving uneven distribution:\nF1 Score = 2 \u00d7 (Recall \u00d7 Precision)/(Recall + Precision). (28)\n2.4. Case Studies\nIn this paper, a modified version of the Garver IEEE 6 bus test system modelled in [28] was used in\ndescribing the attack scenarios, whereas a 24-bus system was used for the evaluation of the developed\nMLPNN algorithm. The Electrical Transient Analyzer Program (ETAP) Toolkit developed by ETAP,\nOperation Technology Inc, is a commercial software package that is widely used for power system\ndesign, simulation, monitoring operation, analysis, optimization, and stability studies. In this study,\nthe ETAP version 16.0 was used to run the AC version of the OPF calculations. The implementation\nof the MLPNN algorithm used was based on the open source machine learning framework Orange\n(Orange 3.20.1). The SVM embedded in the Orange framework is from the LibSVM package, while the\nMLPNN uses the Sklearn Python Module.\n9\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3586\n2.4.1. Cyberattack Scenario Explanation Using a Modified Garver IEEE 6-Bus System\nFigure 4 presents the one-line diagram of the modified Garver test system used for the cyberattack\ndescription and the consequences on the power system. The test system has six nodes consisting of\nthree generating units, six loads, and seven lines connecting the nodes. The generating units are at\nnode 1, node 3, and node 6, whereas the loads are on node 1, node 2, node 3, node 4, node 5, and node\n6. The assumption is that the cyberattack only made changes to the topology and no changes were\nmade to the physical parameters of the lines and load values.

In the description of the attack, two scenarios\nare considered. In Scenario A, we assumed that the network is free of intrusion whereas in Scenario B,\nwe assumed that the network is under attack and the grid operators are unaware of the cyber intrusion.\nFor both scenarios, the grid is operational.\n1. Scenario A\nIn Scenario A, an assumption was made that there was no manipulation or any attack intrusion\non the network topology or data. Figure 4 presents the one-line diagram of the Scenario A test system.\nThe generator power output data and load data for Scenario A are depicted in Table 2. The total load\ndemand for the network without any intrusion is 255.74 MW, whereas the total generator power output\nfrom the three generators is 430.2 MW. Load flow was conducted on Scenario A using the load flow\nfunction in the ETAP program.\n10\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3586\nTable 2.

Scenario B\nIn Scenario B, the assumption was made that there was intrusion, and the attacker(s) made\nsome changes based on the simultaneous attack described in [6], whereby simultaneous attacks,\nwhich will not lead to a non-convergence simulation, are carried out on bus nodes. Attackers are\naware that, for any type of attack, the isolation/de-energization of critical node(s), major sections, or\nthe entire database will lead to non-convergence power flow computation. Therefore, the assumption\nin this paper is that attackers only make changes slight that affect the grid, but the network remains\noperational. Grid operators are unaware of the changes, and the network operates with the corrupted\ndata. The one-line diagram for Scenario B is presented in Figure 5.\nFigure 5. Scenario B test system.\nAs presented in Figure 5, the modified Garver 6-bus test system configuration topology has been\naltered due to the simultaneous attack. The simultaneous attack consists of the de-energization of\nthe generator at node 3 and the manipulation of the sending and receiving buses of a line, such that\nintruders reconfigured the network by changing the origin and destination of line 1 from bus 1 to bus\n5. The dashed line reflects the line that was attacked by the intruder.\nThe data for the generator units for Scenario B are depicted in Table 3. The total generator power\noutput from the two supplying generators available in Scenario B is 280.2 MW, as the attack has already\nde-energized the generator at node 3.\nTable 3.

The Scenario B simulation results in\nthe flows in the transmission lines using the poisoned data from the simultaneous attack, as depicted\nin Table 5.\n2.4.2. Evaluation of the Prediction and Detection Algorithm Using the 24-Bus System\nThis paper made use of real time data. For simplicity, the network data used only covered the\nSouthWest and NorthWest geopolitical zone of the Nigerian grid\u2019s network topology. The 24-bus\nsystem used covered only some 330 kV stations across the geopolitical zones. Figure 6 depicts the\none-line diagram of the modelled 24-bus system. The test system comprises 37 transmission lines,\n17 loads, and 8 generators. The lines were modelled using their pi-equivalent circuits. The generators\nwere modelled using steady state real and reactive powers limits. The loads were modelled using\nsteady state real and reactive power consumption value limits.\nFigure 6. One-line diagram of the 24-bus system.\nThe modified generator data profile used in the study is presented in Figure 7, whereas the\nmodified load data profile collected from the daily operational report used is presented in Figure 8.\nAs shown in Figures 7 and 8, respectively, the generator data represent a daily generator data profile\nfor a three weeks duration, whereas the load data profile has a time interval of thirty (30) minutes.\nBoth the generator and load data used were for a one week duration, using modified data from the\nNigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission daily operational report [36] from 1 to 21 February 2018.\nFigure 7. Generator output profile.\n12\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3586\nFigure 8. Load profile.\n3. Results and Discussion\nIn this section, the results of the case studies are analyzed and presented.\n3.1. Comparison of the Two Scenarios\nThe description of the cyber intrusion is explained with Scenarios A and B. Tables 4 and 5 present\nthe flow simulation results of Scenario A and Scenario B respectively. Figure 9 presents the comparison\nof the bus voltage simulation result for Scenario A and B. Note that, for both scenarios, bus 1 has a bus\nvoltage of 1 pu, as the bus is chosen as the slack/reference bus.\nTable 4.

The upper\nand lower limits for voltage stability endorsed by American National Standards Institute (ANSI) are\n1.05 pu and 0.95 pu, respectively [37]. As shown in Figure 9, bus 6 is clearly below the limit while bus 2\nand bus 3 are very close to the lower standard limit for Scenario B. IEEE guidelines and operational safety\nrequire a response and action to be taken by the operators to rectify such situations. Hence, early detection\nof cyber intrusions into the power system network is highly important to grid operators.\n13\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3586\nFigure 9. Scenario A and Scenario B bus voltage comparison results.\nFigure 10 presents the comparison result of the current flows on the lines with and without\nintrusion (Scenario A and B respectively). Line 4 and line 2 have the highest magnitude for current\nflow for Scenario A and Scenario B, respectively. Despite the intrusion presence in Scenario B, Figure 10\nshows a close relationship at line 7 for both scenarios in terms of current flows on the lines, which typifies\nthe fact that the presence of intrusion on a power system can be tedious to predict or pinpoint.\nFigure 10. Scenario A and Scenario B current flow comparison results.\nMoreover, Figure 11 depicts the comparison result of the power flows on the lines for both Scenario\nA and Scenario B. As shown in Figure 11, there is a significant difference in terms of the power flow\non each individual line in the network. Line 2 has the highest magnitude of power flow for the\nintrusion-presence Scenario B, while the lowest magnitude of power flow occurred in the same line\nwhen there was no intrusion.\nFigure 11. Scenario A and Scenario B power flow comparison results.\n14\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3586\n3.2. Hybrid SVMNN Classification Report\nIn order to obtain the best possible results from the developed SVM model, which will be\nstacked with the MLPNN, we experimented using three prominent kernel functions: RBF, Polynomial,\nand Sigmoid functions. The Cost C and gamma value were kept at constant values of 1.2 and 0.25,\nrespectively. Some notable results from preliminary experiments are summarized in Table 6.\nTable 6. Summarized classification results comparing the SVM kernel function\u2019s performance.\nKernel\nFunction\nPrecision Accuracy Recall F1 Score\nTraining Time\n(Second)\nRBF 95.7% 95.5% 95.5% 95.2% 8.92\nPolynomial 87.2% 85.6% 86.3% 86.5% 8.36\nSigmoid 81.6% 78.6% 78.6% 79.8% 5.83\nAs shown in Table 6, RBF presented the best result while the sigmoid kernel function gave\nthe lowest accuracy. Hence, the RBF kernel function was stacked with the developed MLPNN.\nAlso, after developing the MLPNN algorithm, in order to achieve a result with reduced generalization\nerrors and overfitting problems, the L2 regularization parameter was varied. Table 7 presents the\nnotable preliminary results achieved by varying the L2 regularization parameter.\nTable 7. Summarized classification results varying the MLPNN L2 regularization parameter.\nL2 Regularization\nParameter\nPrecision Accuracy Recall F1 Score\nTraining Time\n(Second)\n100 87.5% 81.9% 81.9% 73.7% 18.38\n85 94.3% 85.2% 85.2% 80.7% 17.83\n65 94.6% 93.8% 93.8% 93.3% 16.35\n50 97.6% 94.2% 94.2% 93.8% 14.25\n35 96.2% 96.1% 96.1% 96.5% 9.8\nTable 8 presents the hybrid SVMNN model\u2019s evaluation metrics from the confusion matrix.\nThis model is a binary classifier, and the two classes targets are labelled non-intrusive data sample\n(NID) and intrusive data samples (ID). As shown in Table 8, the modelled SVMNN classifier predicted\n203 non-intrusive data (NID) samples and 40 intrusive data (ID) samples from the testing data samples.\nTable 9 presents the classification result of the hybrid SVMNN compared with the best results from the\nstandalone MLPNN and SVM classifiers.\nTable 8.

MLPNN has the ability to learn\ncomplex relationships and can easily generalize models and give efficient predictions. Thus, as expected,\nthe standalone MLPNN gave a good result with an accuracy of 96.1%. However, the best result was\nachieved from the hybrid algorithm. Table 10 presents the comparison result from the paper with some\nproposed schemes in the literature.\nTable 10.

[19], the proposed\nANN model was able to detect 92\u201399.5% (averaging 95.75% accuracy) involving a 24-bus system.\nFurther, Hink et al. [16] compared several machine learning approaches and achieved an approximately\n95% precision accuracy using Adaboost + JRipper for a binary classification. In a similar approach,\nthe authors in [17] reported a detection accuracy result of 93.91% using a model that involved using\na random forest as the basic classifier of AdaBoost and a weighted voting (AWV) model on PMU\ncyberattacks. Furthermore, the authors in [2] reported a detection accuracy result of 97% in the case of\na severity class C attack involving an attack on only two lines at a time. Note that the authors in [2]\ndid not consider intrusions into generator and load injections. In a similar article in [20], where the\nauthors equally considered a 24-bus system in a graph matching approach and achieved a 100% result,\nit needs to be pointed out that the authors only considered cyberattacks on a topological power system\nconfiguration. However, in this paper, both topological configurational intrusions, as well as intrusions\ninto the generator and load injections, were considered. The simulation results of the prediction and\ndetection algorithm developed showed the effectiveness of the scheme, which can be employed for the\neffective protection of power systems.\n4. Conclusions\nSecurity threats, such as cyber intrusions into the power grid, necessitate responses from all\nstakeholders involved in the electricity grid. Detecting and preventing such cyber intrusions is\nimportant in current and future research. In this paper, power system cyber intrusion scenarios\ninvolving topological modifications and polluted data are described, and the effects of intrusions\non the AC power flow result of OPF are discussed using a modified IEEE Garver 6 bus test system\nas a case study. A prediction and detection scheme based on a hybrid SVMNN was developed to\npredict and detect cyber intrusion attacks into the power system. The algorithm was developed\nto evaluate a bus voltage dataset. Several simultaneous attacks scenarios, including the removal\nof transmission lines and generators, were considered as cyber intrusions in the 24-bus case study.\nThe proposed SVMNN method showed 99.6% precision and accuracy rates in predicting and detecting\nsimultaneous attacks. However, despite showing tremendous accuracy in predicting and detecting\ncyber-intrusion, the developed algorithm cannot identify, locate, or eliminate present or future intrusion.\nFuture work can focus on extending this work to developing avenues, to identify attacked stations\nand/or transmission lines.\nAuthor Contributions: All the authors have contributed equally to this article.\nFunding: This research was funded by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), South Africa.\nConflicts of Interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest.\n16\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3586\nReferences\n1.

In the\nalgorithm, the first layer handles transformer allocation and medium voltage network routing,\nthe second layer deploys the low voltage network routing and transformer sizing, while the\nthird presents a method to allocate distributed energy resources in an electric distribution system.\nThe proposed algorithm routes an electrical distribution network in a georeferenced area, taking into\naccount the characteristics of the terrain, such as streets or intersections, and scenarios without\nsquared streets. Moreover, the algorithm copes with scalability characteristics, allowing the addition\nof loads with time. The model analysis discovers that the algorithm reaches a node connectivity\nof 100%, satisfies the planned distance constraints, and accomplishes the optimal solution of\nunderground routing in a distribution electrical network applied in a georeferenced area. Simulating\nthe electrical distribution network tests that the voltage drop is less than 2% in the farthest node.\nKeywords: electrical distribution system; graph theory; micro grids; heuristic; optimization; planning\n1. Introduction\nThe unpredictable increasing in electricity demand has made challenging the design and planning\nof any electrical system in transmission or distribution level. The population growth, migration and\ncity planning had reduced the performance of the Electric Distribution Systems (EDS) in large cities,\nespecially in third world countries. The main reason for that is the conventional deployed EDS was\ndesigned without formal considerations of planning or projected demand. Consequently, the regular\nEDS are mainly unplanned and the electricity service throughout the networks are unsatisfactory with\nproblems in the entire system, for instance reliability and stability.\nElectricity transportation seriously concerns designers due to the large distance from generation\nto the final customer. Conversely, the generation in Micro Grid (MG) with Distribute Energy Resources\n(DER) is close to the end-user or is in the same Low Voltage (LV) network, therefore avoiding the power\ntransmission [1]. Biomass, solar or wind power, and small hydro generators are some examples of\nDERs. Those alternatives are boosting the local generation, increasing the continuous electrical service,\ndecreasing the fossil fuel dependency and can achieve a clean ecosystem by reducing emissions [2\u20134].\nNowadays, modern EDS must satisfy optimization, security, reliability, and energy efficiency\nrequirements, which are considered as fundamental requirements in the design and implementation\nprocess. For instance, MG is the integration of optimal EDS with DER. In order to implement a Smart\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1607; doi:10.3390/su11061607 www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability19\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1607\nGrid (SG), firstly the EDS should reach security and, reliability requirement via technical planning.\nMoreover, the EDS must be optimal and technically adequate because the end customer is close to that\nsystem, and due to its investment cost this is considerable compared to the entire network [5\u20137].\nFurthermore, DERs are a promising solution for the implementation of Low Carbon (LC)\nTechnologies in a conventional electrical system. Considering that the power generation industry is\na considerable source of CO2, a growing number of EDS have connected to DER in order to follow\nthe LC policies [8]. The LC policies suggest countries adopt clear and measurable objectives to reduce\nemissions. There is some research which proposes an acceptable level of reduction, as is the case of [9],\nwhich proposed a model to reduce 80% of CO2 emissions taking as based line 1990, and introduced\nthe implementation of mitigation technologies, including DER in EDS.\nThe Figure 1 shows the percentages contributions of each technology in the reduction of emissions.\nSpecial attention is focused on the electricity decarbonisation, smart growth and rooftop PV. The first\ntechnology is mainly the integration of renewable energy, which is composed of 90% CO2 free\ntechnologies. The second involves the optimal planning of EDS and the transportation systems.\nThe third constitutes of rooftop PV implementation in residential and commercial buildings considering\n10% of electricity demand should be reduced by the implementation of rooftop PV [9].\nFigure 1. Percentage of CO2 reduction contribution of Distribute Energy Resources (DER) implemented\nin a Electric Distribution Systems (EDS) [9].\nThe mathematical model proposes in this paper achieve the entire connectivity, in order to cope\nwith this objective the minimum expansion tree algorithm was applied, and the radial topology\nof a georeferenced EDS was obtained. By this methodology, the power balance in the network is\nachieved automatically and guaranteed, as well as the scalability, including the case of whether\nfurther residential or industrial loads would be connected to the system. The model performance\ntest was developed in a Geographic Information System (GIS), where all the elements of the network\nare represented as nodes. Aside from the map information like streets, roads, and natural features,\nthis representation includes homes, LV transformers and substations of the selected region.\nSeveral researchers have developed models to find the best topology for an optimal EDS planning.\nFor instance, Ref. [10] is one of the first to have presented a detailed overview of expansion\nplanning models, compared to the different mathematical techniques describing the objective functions,\nconstraints, the programming technique, and the pros and cons associated with the model. On the\nother hand, the approach is commonly used in wireless communication, Inga et al. [6,7,11,12] proposed\na hybrid wireless mesh network infrastructure considering a multi-hop system which is planned for\n20\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1607\nelectric consumption metering in a metropolitan area network, thereby performing an advanced\nmetering infrastructure for use in MG.\nLavorato et al. [13] proposed a critical analysis to integrate the radially as a constraint in an\noptimization model of an EDS, and [14] proposed a mathematical procedure for modelling the radial\nnetworks. Both studies recognize that the radially constraint is a heavy burden to implement in\nany model. Other researches have proposed that the problem can be solved using a combination\nof algorithms, including heuristics to find a good initial solution and then apply the result to a\ndeterministic mathematical optimization [14]. In [15\u201318] proposed implementation of the Minimal\nSpanning Tree (MST) to minimize the energy supplied by medium voltage (MV) in an EDS. In [15]\nalgorithm allowed graphing compression, leading to savings in computing time. Ref. [19] also tackled\nthe active power loss minimizing problem using MST.\nThe optimization algorithm for determining the route for MV feeders was developed using\nsimulated annealing algorithm in [20], who proposed a three stages methodology. Additionally,\nresearchers in [21] describe a heuristic with the objective of minimizing the loss of power applying\nEDS reconfiguration. Ref. [22] used the complex network analysis and graph theory to explain the\nproperties and exposed the mathematical representation of the electrical topology that are implemented\nin the real EDSs. In [23] describes the network design problem using the cooperative Tabu research\nthat is the first level of the capacitated multicommodity. Ref. [24] proposed a model, using the adapted\ngenetic algorithm, to minimize the voltage drop in distribution transformers, considering size, quantity,\nand siting.\nThere are several heuristics methods that can be used to solve an optimisation problem, in the\npaper [25] a scheme is explained the pros and cons of the \u201cbest solvers\u201d, based on the analysis of a\nconsiderable amount of articles. The efficiency and closeness to the global optimum solution of some\nheuristic solvers are tested in [26], where implemented a Home Energy Management solved through\nfive heuristic algorithms.\nThe heuristics methods applied GIS are investigated in several technological areas, for instance,\nthe introduction of more flexible technologies in urban areas [27]. Whilst [28,29] study the DER\npenetration in an implemented photo-voltaic systems. The problem in [30] is solved through a\nmodified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which included a new mutation method to improve\nthe global searching thereby avoiding the local optimum. Ref. [31] applied the local search heuristics\nrepresenting the EDS as a spanning forest problem. The proposed algorithms are based on the research\nof the shortest spanning sub tree and connection network, originally proposed by [32,33].\nBased on the extensive bibliographic research, a model of DER planning with MG integration\ndeployed in a GIS is hardly resolved by linear programming, because it implies a large computational\ntime due to the complexity and the massive amount of involved variables. The proposed problem\nrepresents a combinatorial problem, which includes the routing cost minimization as objective function\nand constraints of connectivity, radial, distance and voltage profiles. In conclusion, the problem is\nNP-Complete and as a result, lacks a globally optimal solution [30].\nFor the reasons exposed above, the raised problem is not trivial and it must be solved applying\nheuristic models. The solution of the mathematical model of the EDS planning is proposed as a routing\nproblem which is approached through a complex network analysis and graph theory [34]. Hence, it is\nnecessary to perform a heuristic model that can reach a near optimal solution or sub-optimal solution.\nThe present paper presents a mathematical model that applies graph theory as a multi-layer algorithm;\none of them addresses the problem of routing of a MV network, the second the LV network, and the\nthird allocate the DER in the EDS.\nThe remainder of this article is organised as follow, in the Section 2 the problem formulation\nis presented, the simulation results are presented in Section 3. Finally, in Section 4 the conclusions,\nrecommendations and future works.\n21\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1607\n2. Problem Formulation\nThe Optimal Routing of Electrical Distribution Networks is defined as a NP-complete problem,\nto deal with it a heuristic model is used. The model is divided into three algorithms; Algorithm 1\nsolves the problem in MV network, while Algorithm 2 works with the resolution in LV network,\nand Algorithm 3 determines the allocation of the rooftop PV in the scenario. In Table 1 are presented\nthe variables used in the model.\nTable 1.

The objective Function (1) finds the minimum length of path feeder, where C\nis the cost of distances and X represents the activation or deactivation of each node connection.\nThe Equations (2) and (3) represent the radial nature for the network where the numbers of connections\nmust be n \u2212 1, where n is the number of nodes. Finally, the Equation (4) demonstrates that the\nconnections have two states, like 0 or 1, whether there is disconnections or connection, respectively.\nMinimize \u2211\nij\u2208E\nCijXij (1)\n22\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1607\nSubject to \u2211\nij\u2208E\nXij = n \u2212 1 (2)\n\u2211\nij\u2208E:i\u2208S,j\u2208S\nXij \u2264 |S| \u2212 1 \u2200S \u2286 V (3)\nXij \u2208 {0, 1} \u2200ij \u2208 E (4)\nAlgorithm 1 Optimal location and routing a MV grid network.\n1: procedure\n2: Step: 1 Variables\n3: P, distN, X, Y, Cap, R\n4: Step: 2 Optimal transformer selection\n5: used \u2190 prim(X, Y);\n6: Ind \u2190 f ind(sum(used) == 1);\n7: Xtr \u2190 Xbe(Ind);\n8: Ytr \u2190 Ybe(Ind);\n9: Step: 3 Find nearest street point to customer\n10: Loc1 \u2190 [XsYs];\n11: Loc2 \u2190 [XLstYLst];\n12: for i \u2192 1 : N do\n13: for j \u2192 1 : length(XLst) do\n14: disti,j \u2190 haversine(Loc1, Loc2);\n15: z \u2190 f ind(disti,j == min(min(disti,j)));\n16: EndFor\n17: EndFor\n18: Xnp \u2190 Loc2(z, 1);\n19: Ynp \u2190 Loc2(z, 2);\n20: Step: 4 Optimal Routing MV grid\n21: X \u2190 [XnpXtrXse];\n22: Y \u2190 [YnpYtrYse];\n23: disti,j = haversine(X, Y);\n24: G(disti,j <= R) \u2190 1;\n25: path \u2190 primmst(sparse(G));\n26: Step: 5 Determine the final cost of MV\n27: for i \u2192 1 : length(X) do\n28: for j \u2192 1 : length(X) do\n29: costMV \u2190 costMV + disti,j(path);\n30: EndFor\n31: EndFor\n32: End procedure\nThe Algorithm 1 has five steps.The first declares the variables, distance R and the capacity number\nCap restriction to zero, or receives the georeference information from the map, including the latitude\nand longitude of end-user, candidate sites and substation location. The information was taken from\nan OpenStreetMap (OSM) file, including the georeferenced information about the houses\u2019 shape,\nmain routes, streets, public spaces, and more. Step 2 determines the optimal transformer selection\nusing Prim algorithm, which returns the number and transformer index of optimal configuration.\nStep 3 is responsible to find the nearest street point to customer, it is done through the distance\ncalculation of each end-user to the each constituted point street, and determining the closest point\nto each home, this solution has the same number as end existing users. The fourth step searches\nthe optimal routing of the MV grid, which used the haversine distance calculation to determine the\n23\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1607\ndistance between all elements in the network. After that, the connectivity matrix is calculated with the\nmodel restrictions, next the Prim minimal spanning tree is applied to find the minimum rout. The fifth\nstep determines the cost that corresponds to the total distance of the elements of the MV network.\nThe Algorithm 2 determines the optimal routing of the LV grid network, which approaches the\nproblem dividing the network in pieces of the transformer that serves to the end user customer.\nThe solution is proposed in five steps as follows. Step 1 is similar as the Algorithm 1 and aim\nthe initialization or complete the needed information. Step 2 determines the distance between\neach end user with all solution transformer of Algorithm 1. After that, the connectivity matrix is\ncalculated, which considers the connectivity between the transformer and the substation as already\ndone, and the connection from the substation to end-user as non available. Step 3 implements the\nDijkstra algorithm calculation, which find the optimal LV connections. Step 4 calculates the optimal\nrout of the corresponded elements to the transformer, and the step individually considers the LV\nconnections. Finally, step 5 calculates the final cost that correspond with the final distance of conductor\nin LV network.\nFinally, the Algorithm 3 allows us to determine the allocation of the rooftop photo-voltaic panels in\nthe houses. The houses percentage chosen is 10%, based on the contribution of PV in MG. The algorithm\nin step 1 gathers the end user coordinates in one array, after the PV amount is determined with the\nresearched criteria and is stored in PVs, in step 2. In step 3 the center of mass is calculated though\nk-medoids algorithm, the scenario is divided into PVs variable clusters. In step 4, the electrical power\nis assigned for each end user, and the power for each rooftop is 10 KV, the same for all scenarios.\nAlgorithm 2 Optimal routing a LV grid network.\n1: procedure\n2: Step: 1 Variables\n3: P, distN, X, Y, Cap, R\n4: Step: 2 Determine the distance end user, transformer\n5: disti,j = haversine(X, Y);\n6: G(disti,j <= R) \u2190 1;\n7: G(1 : N, N + M + 1 : N + M + S) \u2190 in f ;\n8: G(N + M + 1 : N + M + S, 1 : N) \u2190 in f ;\n9: G(N + 1 : N + M + S, N + 1 : N + M + S) \u2190 in f ;\n10: Step: 3 Applying Dijkstra\n11: Pred \u2190 dijkstra(G, P);\n12: Step: 4 Optimal Routing LV grid\n13: for Trans \u2192 1 : N do\n14: X \u2190 [Xnp(Pred)XTrans];\n15: Y \u2190 [Ynp(Pred)YTrans];\n16: disti,j = haversine(X, Y);\n17: G(disti,j <= R) \u2190 1;\n18: path \u2190 primmst(sparse(G));\n19: EndFor\n20: Step: 5 Determine the final cost of LV\n21: for i \u2192 1 : length(X) do\n22: for j \u2192 1 : length(X) do\n23: costLV \u2190 costLV + disti,j(path);\n24: EndFor\n25: EndFor\n26: End procedure\n24\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1607\nAlgorithm 3 Allocation of DER PV generator.\n1: procedure\n2: Step: 1 Inizialization\n3: X \u2190 [Xs];\n4: Y \u2190 [Ys];\n5: SH \u2190 [XY];\n6: Step: 2 Determining PV amount\n7: PVs \u2190 f loor(length(SH) \u2217 0.1);\n8: Step: 3 Determining the center of mass\n9: PVC \u2190 kmedoids(SH, PVs);\n10: Step: 4 Power assignation\n11: PVP \u2190 10KV;\n12: End procedure\n3. Analysis of Results\nThe case study is part of the EDS of the area of Tytherington in the north of Macclesfield in\nCheshire, England. The limits in longitude in the present study are \u22122.1360 to \u22122.1270, meanwhile,\nthe latitude starts from 53.2730 to 53.2810, the total area is 1.15 square kilometers. In the scenario,\nthere are 813 loads with a total power of 5.4 MW. The presented model deploys the EDS, including the\nnetwork planning expansion. Therefore, the model designs an efficient and reliable EDS, with the\nlowest investment cost. The network planning expansion allows us to use the initial configuration and\nexpand the EDS with a short and medium time period. The model was developed with the algorithms\none and two presented below, which was implemented in Matlab.\nIn the Table 2 are presented the simulation parameters used in the implementation. The selected\narea has a density of 700 end users per kilometer square, which is considered lower in comparison\nwith the average density in the cities in Europe. The deployment requires a maximum distance of\n100 m from an end user to transformer, with a coverage of 100% in the entire network. The installation\ntype in both networks is under grounded and the configuration is radial in order to accomplish with\nthe EDS requirements. The number of main feeders from the substation is one. Whilst, the voltage\nin the MV installation, between the substation and the transformers, is 11 KV, and the LV network\nvoltage is 400 V. Finally, the concentrated load is balanced in all the experimental procedure.\nThe studied georeferenced scenario is shown in Figure 2. First, in order to analyze the designed\nnetwork performance, the scenario was divided into six different clusters, the homes in the same\ncluster were outlining with the same colors. The division by clusters was made with the K-medoids\nalgorithm, but any clustering algorithm could be used. The clusters are numbered from 1 to 6 in\nclockwise, starting with the left upper with the number 1 and the located in the middle left is the 6.\nThe power consumption of each home depends on the cluster membership, in the cluster 1 the average\nconsumption is 300 KVA, whilst the average power in the cluster 2 is 400 KVA and the houses of\ncluster 6 the consumption is 800 KVA, correspondingly. The power assignment is random normally\ndistributed, depending on the cluster membership.\nThe substation location is aleatory, where must exist enough space for the implementation of\nthis building. It can be changed, and the optimum substation allocation is proposed for future work.\nThe transformer candidate sites are shown in the graph as well. These sites are called manhole or\ncheckup points. To find these points are considered all the corners or bifurcation points in any street,\nin total there are 314 checkup points. These points are the input of the prim algorithm with the desired\nmaximum distance, therefore the prim algorithm output is the final transformer allocation.\n25\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1607\nStart\nInput Georeferenced \nScenario\nAlgorithm 1\nHas converge?\nAlgorithm 2\nHas converge?\nAlgorithm 3\nShow the results of \noptimization\nEnd of Process\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nFigure 2. The flowchart of the ordinal interaction of the three algorithms proposed for the authors.\nA constraint in the model is the maximum distance between the end user and their corresponding\nLV transformer. The distance restriction is an input parameter in the prim algorithm, that decided the\nfinal transformer allocation. Thus, based on this distance parameter two scenarios are proposed,\nthe first scene takes the restriction of 80 m and the second 100 m, and are called A and B\nscenario, respectively.\nThe optimization applying graph theory is based on the connectivity matrix. The connectivity\nmatrix of the presented scenario A is shown in Figure 3, where is seen a symmetrical square matrix of\nN+M+S elements. Where N is the number of end users, M is the number of activated transformers\nand S is the substations number. In order to find the connectivity matrix, the distance matrix is\ncalculated, which as shown in the graph represents the distance between homes to homes, homes to\ntransformers, homes to the substation and finally transformers to the substation. The color in the\nmatrix represents the distance, for instance, a dark color means a closer distance compared with a light\ncolor. Moreover, the white dots illustrates the possible connections between nodes, the white dots are\nlocated whether the restriction distance is accomplished. The number nz in the bottom of the figure is\n8426, which represents the number of total connections in the studied scenario. There are two extreme\nfringes in the figure, the right and the bottom one; those fringes represent the connection between\ntransformers and end users. Notice that the form of the fringes changes respect to the rest of the\nfigure, mainly that there are more white dots which means the higher connection possibility between\ntransformers and end user. This is due the optimal transformer allocation. Besides, the principal\ndiagonal consideration must be considered, because it represents the distance between the same node,\nand it must be changed for a greater distance in order to do not obtain erroneous model results.\n26\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1607\nTable 2.

Studied scenario with the transformer candidate cites and substation localization. The end\nuser power consumption is represent with different colors depending on the cluster.\nThe obtained result with the Algorithm 1 is the sub optimal MV network routing of scenario A\nis shown in Figure 4, which was generated with a distance constraint of 80 m and a connectivity of\n100%. In this scenario, there are 76 transformers located in the candidate sites using the prim algorithm.\nTherefore, the distance and connectivity constraints are accomplished through the location of the\ntransformers. Moreover, initially, by the MV network route origins in the substation and by means of\none feeder deliveries power to all the MV transformers. The planned routing is radial, following the\nroutes of the streets, consequently, the MV network can be implemented as an underground network.\nThe MV network length is 14.05 km, connected by one conductor all the transformers through MST.\nThe planned routing is an alternative method for resilience network in order to the designer can be\n27\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1607\nplanned optional routes in case of adverse operating conditions, this topic is proposed as future work.\nScenario B is shown in Figure 5, which was generated with distance and connectivity constraints of\n100 m and 100%, correspondingly. In the present scenario, there are 55 transformers located in the\ncandidate sites, accomplishing the desired constraints. As well as the previous scenario, the planned\nrouting is radial, following the routes of the streets, consequently, the MV network can be implemented\nas an underground network. The MV network length is 12.15 km, connected by one conductor all the\ntransformers through MST. In scenario B, there are 21 transformers and 2 km of conductor less than the\nlast analyzed scenario. However, those savings affects the LV distribution network design because the\nreduction in the transformers amount represents the overloading of them. Moreover, the transformers\npower capacity must be raised by reason that the corresponding demand will the higher. Under those\ncircumstances, Scenario A henceforth will be called the suboptimal solution of the presented model.\nThe presented results in Table 3 compare the data obtained from the A and B scenarios.\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800\nnz = 8426\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\nDistance between nodes and connectivity matrix\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n900\n1000\nFigure 4. Distance and connectivity matrix of scenario A.\nThe LV network was designed through Algorithm 2, optimal routing of a LV grid network,\nexplained in the sections below. The obtained result is presented in Figure 6, there is shown the\ngeoreferenced scenario with LV network implementation and irregular polygons sketched in the graph,\ndelimiting the transformers area of service. The end users with 100% connectivity are connected to\nthe LV network through the operator service cable. Those cables connect the home nearest point to\nthe corresponding nearest street point; this calculation is included in the model. The distance in the\nLV network includes the length from house to the street and from that point down the street to the\ntransformer. The model for the LV network design is subject to the application of distance restriction.\n28\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1607\nFigure 5. Sub optimal Routing of medium voltage (MV) Network, scenario A.\nThe connection representation between the transformer with their end users are shown in the\nFigure 7 through the irregular polygons, those indicate the service area of each activated transformer.\nThe mentioned polygons gather the elements belonging to the individual LV EDS, the transformer\nnormally is inside the polygon, but can be in the edge, the polygon joins all the connection house\npoints including the transformer. If the transformer does not belong to any polygon, it means that\nit just delivers power to one end user, normally the closest one. There are some houses in the study\nthat are not considered as nodes of the network, especially they are located within the map end limits.\nThe end users connect to the corresponding transformer via under grounded electrical installation.\nThe result implementation of Algorithm 3 is shown in the Figure 8, the allocation of rooftop\nPV is. All the PV panels have a power of 10 KVA. The percentage of houses with PV panels are\n10% of all the scenario, in total 79 houses, with a total power of 790 KV. As a result, the rooftop PV\npanels contribute to 14.5% to the total power deman. Notice that the distribution of the rooftop PV\nare in all the maps, showing the practical allocation of the PV panels. The PV will reduce the power\nconsumption of the power delivered from the substation in approximately 10%. The MV transformer\nshould be bidirectional for the implementation. The design should include the protection and control\nof the network.\nThe obtained results after the application of the three layers algorithm are shown in the figures\nbelow. The Figure 9 shows power (KVA) detailed in the 76 LV network, the purple bar represents the\npower consumption of the LV network, while the dark green bar is the representation of the power\ncontribution of the installed rooftop PV, and the light green bar indicates the assigned MV transformer,\ntaking on consideration standardized transformer values. Moreover, the pink area is the average\npower consumption that represents a power of 71.6 KVA. Analysing the power transformers, it is\nseen that the highest transformer has a power of 280 KVA, whereas the lowest assigned transformer is\n29\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1607\n10 KVA. The differences of each power LV network is due to the algorithm considerations that allow to\ntaking the terrain characteristics respecting the imposed constraints.\nThe Figure 10 shows the number of end users connected to each LV transformer, where 32 is\nthe maximum number, and 1 is the minimum end users, the average end users connected to each\ntransformer is 11. It can be seen that there exists a direct relationship between the power in each LV\nnetwork compared with the number of connected users, and the relation between those variables is\nconsidered as linear.\nIn addition, the proposed model allows planning of an MV and LV network in a georeferenced\narea, maintained under defined constraints and technical specifications with the minimal cost. Figure 11\npresents the total number of transformer classified by the assigned electrical power. For instance,\nthere are nine transformers of 10 KVA, four of 20 KVA, and 10 transformers with a power of 80 KVA,\nwhich is the highest amount of transformers. While the 120 KVA and 170 KVA transformers are\nquantitatively less than others, with one transformer, respectively. Furthermore, there are two 280 KVA\ntransformers, which is the highest assigned power. Thus, it is demonstrated that there are areas\nin the scenario with high-end user density, this characteristic is a characteristic of the 30th and\n39th transformers.\nThe distance constraint in the scenarios A and B, between end user to the corresponding\ntransformer, are 80 and 100 respectively. The coverage is 100% and the % of drop voltage is less\nthan 2% for both scenarios. The number of activated transformers for the scenario a is 76 with an MV\ngrid length of 14.05 km, thus the average transformer distance to the user is 33 m. Compared with\nthe scenario B, which has 55 transformers with a MV grid length of 12.15%, but the distance of the\ntransformer to the end user is 40 m, higher than the case A. As a result, scenario A was selected for the\nsub-optimum scenario and the selected design to be implemented.\nFigure 6.

Conclusions and Future Works\nThis paper proposed a heuristic algorithm based model to solve the routing underground electrical\nnetworks problem in a georeferenced area. The model proposed a three layered algorithm; the first\nhandles transformer allocation and routing of the MV network, the second algorithm works out the LV\nnetwork and transformer sizing, and the third presents a method to allocate DER in an EDS. In this\nresearch, an array of rooftop photovoltaic panels with a specific criteria was allocated. The modelled\nnetworks were implemented in an electrical simulation software to demonstrate the feasibility of the\nproposed topology.\nThe proposed algorithm is capable of routing a network in a georeferenced area, taking into\naccount the characteristics of the terrain, such as streets or intersections, including scenarios without\nsquared streets. The modelled network achieves distance, and end user number constraints.\nThe suboptimal routing underground electrical networks were obtained, minimizing the\nimplementation cost and maximizing the quality of electrical services and the reliability in the network,\nwith a farthest node voltage drop of maximum 2%. The MV grid length was 14.05 km, with 76\nactivated transformers as a total number, an average of 71.6 KVA and 11 connected end users. Further,\nthe allocated rooftop PV panels contributed 14.5% of the total demand of the network.\nThe optimum substation allocation, an alternative method for resilience network design in order\nto accommodate optional routes in case of adverse operating conditions, the application of control\ntechniques and electrical protection in the EDS and the integration of the demand curve in the\nimplementation of PV generation are proposed as future work.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, methodology, software, resources, validation, formal analysis, W.P.,\nE.I. and S.S.; investigation, writing\u2014original draft preparation W.P.; writing\u2014review and editing, supervision, E.I.\nand S.S.\nFunding: This research was funded by Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica Salesiana-Ecuador.

The authors analyzed the achievements to\ndate, and proved the effects of the SGS by comparing its early targets to its performance. To evaluate\nthe performance, we analyzed the data of 2015 with the data of 2014 in three aspects: peak reduction,\npower consumption reduction, and electricity fee savings. Furthermore, we studied the economic\nanalysis including photovoltaic (PV) and energy storage system (ESS) electricity fee savings, as well\nas running cost savings by electric vehicles. Through the evaluation, the authors proved that the\nperformance surpassed the early targets and that the system is economical. With the advantages of\nthe SGS, we suggested directions to expand the system.\nKeywords: smart grid; Smart Grid Station; renewable energy sources; energy management system\n1. Introduction\nFor many years, concerns about global warming and climate change have been growing. In\nresponse to these environmental problems, most developed and developing countries have held\nmeetings and sought countermeasures. However, due to the expiration of the Kyoto Protocol in 2020\n(Post2020), the Paris Agreement\u2014a statement of intent to address climate change problems\u2014was\nsigned by 195 countries at the twenty-first Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), held in Paris, France in 2015. The objective of the Paris\nAgreement was prevent the increase in the global average temperature from rising more than 2 \u25e6C\nabove pre-industrial levels [1]. Each country set its own target with regard to greenhouse gas (GHG)\nemissions. Table 1 shows the goals for the GHG reduction of some selected countries.\nTable 1. Goals of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction for selected countries [2\u20135].\nCountries Goals\nChina To lower carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 60\u201365% from the 2005 level\nEU At least 40% domestic reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 1990\nJapan At the level of GHG emission reductions of 26% by 2030 compared to 2013\nSouth Korea GHG emission reduction by 37% from the business as usual (BAU) level by 2030\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3512; doi:10.3390/su10103512 www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability37\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3512\nThrough Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, the Korean government set a goal to\nreduce GHG emissions by 37% compared to business as usual (BAU) by 2030 [5]. In their effort,\nthe Korean government has tried to expand renewable energy (RE) generation and developed new\ntechnologies. One of these technologies is the smart grid (SG), which is a new concept of an electrical\ngrid integrated with information and communication technologies (ICT).\nSince 2009, the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO, a public organization) has installed\nand demonstrated SG technologies. The Jeju Smart Grid Demonstration Project was the first test-bed\nbuilt on Jeju Island in 2009. This project had five themes: smart place, smart transportation, smart\nrenewable, smart power grid, and smart service. It included renewable energy sources, electric meters,\nelectric vehicles, a battery system, demand responses, transmissions, communications, etc. Using the\nexperience gained in that project, the Smart Grid Station (SGS) was built in the Guri branch office\nbuilding of KEPCO in 2014 as the first demonstration. The \u201cstation\u201d in SGS refers to a place or building\nthat can provide various services. Therefore, the SGS is a place that provides intelligent electricity\nservices to customers. This new business model is different from building energy management\nsystems (BEMSs). The BEMS is used for minimizing energy costs by primarily managing HVAC\n(heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), lighting, and other systems [6], and Ock et al. have\nproposed a control system using building energy control patterns to adjust the energy use. The\nHVAC is regarded as an important portion in load demand in [7]. Ferro et al. [7] have suggested\nan architecture based on model predictive control to improve the operation efficiency of building\nenergy consumption. A SG is generally composed of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as\nphotovoltaics (PVs) and wind turbines (WTs), an operation system (OS) as an energy management\nsystem (EMS), an energy storage system (ESS), advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), and other\nsmart devices [8]. References [9\u201311] are about smart zero-energy buildings that utilize internet of things\ntechnologies. Especially, Kolokotsa [9] have emphasized the importance of zero-energy buildings for\nthe smart community, but the support basis is weak in that there is no case study. Wurtz et al. [10] have\ndescribed a global research strategy to improve a smart software. The authors have also considered\nthe strategy in a living lab. In [11], the authors have described smart buildings with a new technology.\nHowever, the proposed system is limited in that the system is focused on the internet of things. In [12],\nKim et al. have suggested an EMS algorithm based on reinforcement learning to reduce energy cost.\nHowever, this research ignored charging and discharging loss of ESS, and the system is composed of\nsimple devices. Barbato et al. [13] have focused on an energy management framework integrating\nrenewable energy, storage bank, and demand response in a smart campus. The authors have discussed\nscenarios to minimize the energy cost. In [14], the authors have dealt with the lighting energy\nconsumption in educational institutes, and have applied a data mining tool to reduce the energy waste\nof lighting. The recent research has described smart buildings, and has mostly focused on algorithms\nwith improvements. On the other hand, we describe the first SGS demonstration, which is a more\ncomprehensive solution than the smart buildings mentioned above, in that the SGS integrates software\nwith hardware including electric vehicles (EVs), a building automation system (BAS), and a distribution\nautomation system. We also conducted a performance evaluation and analyzed its economic feasibility.\nThe goal of the SGS is to optimize energy consumption by utilizing various technologies, even though\nthe SGS is connected to the power grid. Especially, the OS can balance supply and demand in real-time\nby monitoring and controlling the whole system. KEPCO has determined that the office could shave\npower peak and reduce power consumption by use of the SGS. As a result, the SGS has expanded\nto 121 of the branch offices. However, the expansion is limited to KEPCO\u2019s internal branch offices\nin Korea. Although it has been a few years since the first SGS was built, the smart grid industry is\nstagnant. The authors recognized that an analysis was needed to prove the performance of SGS to\npromote the SG industry. For this purpose, this paper presents the concepts and features in Section 2,\nthe description of components in Section 3, and the analysis of the performance of SGS in Section 4. We\ncalculated the performances about peak shaving, reducing power consumption, and saving electricity\nfees to prove the advantages of the technology. The authors also evaluate the economic feasibility by\n38\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3512\nPV, ESS, and EV in Section 5. Based on the results, a discussion is given in Section 6, and Section 7\nconcludes the paper.\n2. SGS Concept and Features\nThe objectives of SGS are to optimize the usage of electricity and to reduce the electricity fee and\nconsumption in a building, with the integration of various technologies.\nWhen renewable energy sources are connected to both the grid and ESS-generated power, the\npower from renewable energy can be supplied to the load directly or can charge a battery of the\nESS. Also, the battery is charged from the grid when the price of electricity on the grid is low and\nis discharged when the price is high. This allows a building to save money and reduce power\nconsumption. In other words, less energy production is required from fossil fuel generators during\npeak load time. Consequently, the SGS benefits the environment by reducing CO2 emissions. As a\npublic organization, KEPCO has developed the SGS with small- and mid-sized businesses to grow\ntogether. Through the accompanied growth, the KEPCO has contributed to popularize components of\nthe system. These effects are shown in Table 2.\nTable 2. Details of the Smart Grid Station (SGS).\nObjective\nReducing Consumption and Saving on Electricity Fees by Optimizing\nUsage in a Building\nExpected Effects\n\u2022 Reduce 5.0% of electricity peak in a year\n\u2022 Reduce 9.6% of power consumption for a year\n\u2022 Save on electricity fees\n\u2022 Reduce 5.0% of CO2 for a year\n\u2022 Accompanied growth with small- and mid-sized businesses\nFeatures\n\u2022 Remote control of demand in a building\n\u2022 Energy management system construction based on SG\n\u2022 Information and communication technologies (ICT) convergence on\nintelligent energy management\nThe Guri SGS project consisted of two steps. The period of the first step was from October 2013 to\nFebruary 2014. This step comprised the installation of PV, ESS, a slow-charging type of EV charger,\nAMI, a smart distribution board, and BAS components. A main goal of the first step was to optimize\nthe building\u2019s energy consumption based on the SG. The second step comprised the addition of WT,\nan HVAC control system, and improving the operation system. The period of the second step was\nfrom December 2014 to June 2015.\nFigure 1 is a diagram of SGS components. It shows power connections and communication\nconnections. PV was connected to a power conversion system (PCS), which makes the power from\nthe renewable energy stable. Because WT was installed at the second step, it was connected to the\ntransformer (TR) room directly. This solution has the characteristics of a test-bed to optimize the\noperation of energy consumption.\nThe power from RE can charge batteries or supply loads including lights, outlets, HVAC, variable\nfrequency drives (VFDs), and EVs. The equipment of the SGS is interconnected in the transformer (TR)\nroom. Also, the KEPCO grid is directly connected to the TR room, and the power quality is checked by\nAMI. The operation system is a software program that plays a key role in integrating other technologies.\nThis system gathers the various data, including voltage, current, frequency, communication status,\nand amount of generated power. This means that the OS can not only control each element remotely,\nbut also maintain the power balance between various components. Each component will be described\nin Section 3.\n39\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3512\nKEPCO\nGrid\nTR\nRoom\nDistribution\nBoards\nAMI EV/C\nWT PV\nBAT\nPCS\nLights\nOutlets\nHVAC\nESS BAS\nPower Line\nCommunication Line\nOperation\nSystem\nFigure 1.

Components Description\n3.1. DERs and Operation System\n3.1.1. Photovoltaic\nThe PV system was mounted at 30\u25e6 on the rooftop. The maximum power of each module is 250 W,\nand the total capacity of the system is 20 kWp. The system is composed of 84 modules consisting of\nmonocrystalline silicon cells, but four of them are dummies which are not generated and connected to\nthe system. The dummies are decorations to make the shape rectangular in 4 by 21. The connection is\n16 series by 5 parallel because of space restriction. The capacity was adopted at 5% of the contracted\npower (400 kW) of the Guri office to reduce 5% of the power peak. The PV system supplies the power\nto the building at peak load time and mid load time, and charges a battery at off-peak load time. By\nutilizing the PV system, KEPCO expected that 9.6% of power consumption would be possible. Table 3\nprovides the specifications of the PV system.\nTable 3. Specifications of the PV system.\nDevice Monocrystalline silicon\nMax Power 250 Wp (60 cells)\nMax Voltage 497.6 V (31.1 V \u00d7 16)\nEfficiency 15.7%\nCapacity 20 kWp (6 by 14, 84 modules, 4 dummies)\nConnection 16 series by 5 parallel\nThe power from PV in summer season, from June to August, does not charge the battery but\nsupplies to building loads directly to reduce the peak and the power consumption.\n3.1.2. Wind Turbine\nA WT system was mounted on the rooftop in March 2015. The PV and the WT installed were as\nin Figure 2. A vertical axis-type WT was selected for the SGS because this WT is suitable in urban areas\nsince it is not influenced by the direction of the wind [15] and does not make noise when the turbine\n40\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3512\nrotates. Also, its cut-in wind speed is a light wind of 3 m/s. These features make the WT system easy\nto install on buildings, but the rated power is 1.2 kW at 15 m/s. This WT was not custom-made, and\nthere was a space restriction. To install the WT on the rooftop while making the best use of the space,\nthe system designer could only choose the small size of WT rated at 1.2 kW. Although this WT can\ngenerate 53 kWh per year according to Weibull performance calculations, the system is not optimal for\ncontributing to energy use reduction, because the wind does not blow fast enough in the urban area.\nNevertheless, its presence is meaningful in that it is an attempt at WT installation on a building.\nBecause this vertical type of WT has unstable output at certain wind speeds and low\nefficiency [15,16], it has its own interconnected inverter to stabilize the output.

Energy Storage System\nThe ESS is composed of a battery and a PCS. Figure 3 shows the battery and the PCS installed\non the rooftop. The ESS can be used for either on-grid status or off-grid status. The ESS has various\neffects: peak shaving, load leveling, providing constant voltage and constant frequency (CVCF), cost\nreduction, load compensation, and so on [17]. In this paper, the authors focused on peak shaving and\nload shifting. Regarding the first function, the ESS charges power from renewable energy sources at\nthe off-peak load time and discharges the power at the peak time. Concerning the second function, the\nESS charges a battery with the power from the grid in the evening and discharges the battery in the\nafternoon. By peak shaving and load shifting, the electricity fee can be saved.\n41\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3512\nThe PCS converts DC-to-AC and AC-to-DC. This means that it can function both as a converter\nand an inverter. PV systems generally have their own inverters, whereas the PCS used in the SGS\nis connected with the battery as well as the PV. Because the PCS is a hybrid type, it is possible to\ncharge and discharge the battery simultaneously, making it possible to optimize the power from the\nPV and the battery. Figure 4 is the inner connection diagram of the PCS. The capacity of the PCS was\ndetermined as 30 kW by adding 20 kWp of the PV system and 10 kW of the expected peak reduction,\nwhich is 5% of the power peak (180 kW) at the Guri office.\nFigure 3.

Inner connection diagram of PCS.\nA lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) battery was selected because this battery has better thermal\nand chemical safety than other types of batteries [18]. The life cycle is 4000 cycles at 80% of depth of\ndischarge (DOD). Its size is 50 kWh, and the capacity was designed to discharge for five hours at 8 kW\nwhile considering 80% of DOD. The 4000 life cycles means that the battery can be used 4000 times if it\ncharges-and-discharges power in the range of 20% to a full charge state. This range is established to\nprevent the battery from reaching a full discharge state. The specification of the ESS is in Table 6.\nThere are three discharge schedules that the operator adjusts, as follows:\n1. Uniform discharge: discharges a uniform amount of power from the battery during peak and\nmid-load times continuously;\n2. Continuous differential discharge: continuously discharges during peak and mid-load times, but\nthe amount is different during peak load time;\n3. Non-continuous differential discharge: discharges non-continuously during peak and mid-load\ntimes, and the amount is different during peak-load time.\nIn summary, the ESS charges the batteries at the off-peak load time and discharges them during\nthe peak and mid-load times on weekdays. It is expected that a customer can reduce power peak by\n5% with these schedules.\n42\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3512\nTable 6.

SGS Operation System\nIn the SGS, the operation system plays the role of the energy management system (EMS) developed\nby KEPCO. It is a software program that can integrate the other components. The integration\nallows the OS to monitor the power consumption of all components in real-time. Moreover, it has a\nhuman\u2013machine interface (HMI) that shows the details of the components. By monitoring, optimized\nmanagement is possible. Specifically, the operator can set schedules for these devices. Regarding the\nPCS, the OS controls the charge\u2013discharge operation mode as shown in Table 7. However, the WT is\nnot considered in the modes, because the output of the WT is too small to contribute to the modes. The\nOS has three categories: system configuration, management, and statistics.\nTable 7. Operation modes of PCS.\nStatus Mode Description\nCharge\nFull charge Full Charge by PV + grid\nOnly PV Charge Charge only by PV\nDischarge\nFull discharge Supply power to loads by PV + BAT\nFixed PCS output \u2022 Fixed PCS output\u2022 BAT output varies with PV output\nFixed BAT output \u2022 Fixed BAT output\u2022 PCS output varies with PV output\nOnly PV discharge Supply power to loads only by PV\nConcurrent\nFixed BAT charge \u2022 Some of PV output charges BAT\u2022 Other supplies to loads\nFixed PCS output \u2022 Some of PV output supplies to loads\u2022 Other charges BAT\nThe first category, system configuration, shows the real-time flow of power. In this section, users\ncan check the status of components and monitor the general data, including electricity fee information,\nsupplied power from each source, and the power consumption of the building. This helps users to\nunderstand the power flow. In this section, the operator monitors the overall status of the system,\n43\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3512\nelectricity fee information, real-time demand power, and supply power including the generation of\nRE and battery discharge. This section also includes information on the communication status of\neach device. The serial communications protocols used in the SGS are Modbus and Zigbee [19]. The\ncomponents are connected in communication lines, and the data of the devices are gathered into the\noperation system. Especially, the PV, PCS, and battery data are sent by International Electrotechnical\nCommission (IEC) 61850. The IEC 61850 protocol standard is for substation to exchange data and\nenables the integration of control, measurement, and monitoring [20]. The used IEC 61850 models\nare the following: IEC 61850-7-420 is used to exchange of data with DERs, and IEC 61850-90-9 has\nfunctions for power converters focused on DC-to-AC and AC-to-DC conversions [19,21,22]. The PV\ndata are voltage and current of generated power, and solar radiation. The PCS measures active power,\nreactive power, phase current, and phase voltage. Also, the battery sends the data of voltage, current,\nstatus of charge, temperature, and each cell\u2019s voltage, current, and temperature.\nThe management is for treating smart lights, smart outlets, VFDs, HVAC, and ESS. As an example\nof this section, the operator is not only able to monitor each smart outlet but also turn them on and off.\nThe statistics section is comprised of an overall analysis, DER analysis, and load forecasting.\nOverall analysis is for supplied power and peak per day, month, and year. This section shows the\nmonthly analysis of supply/demand. The DER analysis shows the PV generation and the amount of\nbattery discharge. One of the main functions of the OS is to forecast the demand of electricity by its\nown algorithm. Through this analysis, the OS controls the devices and power flow, and decides to\ncharge or discharge the battery.\n3.2. Other Ancillary Equipment\n3.2.1. Advanced Metering Infrastructure\nAMI installed in the transformer room of the SGS measures the amount of power supplied from\nthe grid and checks the qualities of voltage, current, and frequency. Through the measures, the SGS\ncan optimize the power supply. A general electricity meter monitors power quality every 15 min,\nwhereas the AMI exports the data in real-time. The exported data are used to calculate the real-time\nelectricity fee and analyze the operation status through the OS. By utilizing the data, the OS can operate\nthe whole system flexibly. This AMI is connected in a series connection to current and in a parallel\nconnection to voltage. Figure 5 shows a picture and the connection of the AMI, and Table 8 provides\nthe detailed specifications of the AMI.\nFigure 5. Pictures of AMI and connection line.\nTable 8. Specifications of the AMI.\nPotential transformer AC 10\u2013452 V/110 V\nCurrent transformer 0.05\u20136 A (rated 5 A)\nMeasurement Voltage, current, freq., etc.\n44\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3512\n3.2.2. Electric Vehicle Chargers\nOutside of the office building, there were a few gasoline vehicles for outside work. Some of\nthem were changed to electric vehicles, and six EV chargers were installed. Four of the chargers\nare a slow-charging type, and the others are a fast-charging type. The slow-charging type has an\nAC-type connector and charges the EV at 7\u20138 kW through a single phase of 220 VAC, and it takes\nabout 5 to 6 h to reach a full charge. The fast-charging type has three kinds of socket: CHAdeMO,\nCombo, and 3-phase AC type. CHAdeMO and Combo supply power in DC. The fast-charging type\nchargers supply power at 50 kW by 380\u2013450 VDC or 380 VAC. In fact, the EV chargers are considered\nas loads, while the EVs contribute to reduce the running cost of vehicles compared to gasoline vehicles,\nas described in Section 5. Through this section, it is proved that the EVs are more economical than\ngasoline vehicles. The EVs also have potential, in that they can be bridges to implement vehicle-to-grid\n(V2G) technology [23].\n3.2.3. Building Automation System\nFor building automation systems, current transformers (CTs) were installed in each distribution\nboard to measure the power quality and the consumed energy by time and by device. These CTs are\nsolid-ring and split-core types, and they communicate with a multi-channel power meter by Modbus.\nAlso, smart outlets and light switches were newly installed to reduce power peak and consumption\nby turning the devices on and off remotely or automatically. This reduction is directly reflected in a\nreduction in the amount of power that needs to be generated by the fossil fuel generators.\nThe outlets can cut off standby power. Their rated allowable current is 16 A, and their overload\ncurrent is 20 A. For the smart lighting, gateways were installed to transmit control signals to the\nlighting from the OS.\nThe other controllable system of the BAS is the HVAC. The OS adjusts the air quality by controlling\nthe frequency of the VFDs to reduce power consumption.\n4. Performance Evaluation\nTo evaluate the performance of the Smart Grid Station, the authors analyzed the reduction of peak\nand consumption, as well as economic feasibility by comparison with the early targets. We acquired\nthe real data of building demand, peak, and DERs measured in 2014 and 2015 from KEPCO.\nThe output data and the performance analysis were based on the real operation of the Smart\nGrid Station, following the algorithm shown in Figure 6. The algorithm was developed by KEPCO.\nFollowing the algorithm, grid power always supplies power to loads, and also optionally charges\nthe battery at off-peak load times such as night time or on weekends. PV can generate when the sun\nshines, and WT can generate when the wind speed is over 3 m/s. If the generation of the PV and\nthe WT exceeds the power demand, the extra power goes to charge the battery at off-peak load time.\nWhen the sources charge the battery, the power goes through PCS. At the peak load time or mid-load\ntime, the grid power, renewable energy sources, and the battery (Pdischarge) supply to loads to reduce\nthe peak of the building. The blue line in Figure 6 shows the communication connection\u2014all data\ngather into the OS. After gathering the generation, supply, and demand data from each device, the OS\ngives orders to the PCS.\nIn the SGS, peak power and consumption are reduced due to the DER. This makes it difficult to\ndirectly compare the decreased value with the unreduced value that could have been measured if not\nfor the reduction. For this reason, the authors tried to compare the reduced peak and consumption\nwith the values from 2014. However, new equipment and appliances were installed for the supervisory\ncontrol and data acquisition (SCADA) room and the temporary office of Namyangju city in the Guri\nbranch office, and we considered these changes in increment. Table 9 shows the details of increment in\nthe building, and the authors assumed the usage time of the devices as in Table 10.\n45\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3512\nAs the equipment for the SCADA room is ICT equipment, it is always used, even on weekends.\nBecause the air conditioning system is an ice storage system, it does not contribute to a rise in the peak.\nPrinters and cooling fans were considered to be unused during peak time to save energy.\nFigure 6.

Peak Shaving\nFor a commercial building, once a peak power is measured, the peak is adopted for the electricity\nfee for the year. The maximum peak occurred in the summer. Thus, the authors compared the peak\nthat occurred in August and September of 2014 with the peak in same months of 2015 as Table 11.\nThe peak shaving ratio (PSR) is the ratio between the maximum peak in 2015 and the maximum\npeak in 2014.\nTable 11. Comparison of peaks.\nDay Peak (kW) Evening Peak (kW) Max Peak (kW)\n2015.08 285.12 294.24\n294.242015.09 255.84 213.12\n2014.08 271.08 259.56\n271.082014.09 255.96 237.24\nPeakadd = 42.01 kW \u00d7 0.9 \u223c= 37.8 kW (1)\nPSR(%) =\nPeak2015max \u2212 Peakadd\nPeak2014max\n\u00d7 100 \u2212 100 (2)\nPSR(%) =\n294.24 \u2212 37.8\n271.08\n\u00d7 100 \u2212 100 = \u22125.40% (3)\nIn (1), 42.01 kW is the sum of rated power of all equipment except cooling fans, printers, and\nthe ice storage AC system in Table 9. The value of added equipment capacity defined in (1) should\nbe subtracted from max peak in 2015. Because the real contribution of the equipment to peak was\nunknown, the authors assumed the contribution by multiplying the rated capacity of devices by\nthe power factor 0.9. Thus, the result of (1) is an estimate of the rated capacity multiplied by the\npower factor (0.9). A positive PSR value represents an increase of peak, whereas a negative value is\na reduction. In (1) and (2), the result of the PSR was \u22125.40%, meaning that the peak was reduced\nby 5.40%.\n4.2. Consumption Reduction\nThe second effect of the SGS is the reduction of power consumption. The data used to calculate\npeak reduction in Section 4.1 was also used in this section.\nThe consumption was separated into three time periods: off-peak load, mid-load, and peak\nload, as shown in Table 12. The added power consumption should be subtracted from the total\nconsumption in 2015. However, because the contribution of the added devices to power consumption\n47\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3512\nwas unidentified, the power factor 0.9 was multiplied to assume the contribution in the same way as\nin (1). The consumption reduction ratio (CRR) is calculated in (5). A positive value of CRR represents\nan increase of power consumption, whereas a negative value means a reduction. In (4) and (5), the\nresult of CRR was approximately \u221211.26%, which means that power consumption was reduced.\nConadd = 39, 277.8 kWh \u00d7 0.9 \u223c= 35, 350 kWh (4)\nCRR(%) =\nCon2015max \u2212 Conadd\nCon2014max\n\u00d7 100 \u2212 100 (5)\nCRR(%) =\n123, 807 \u2212 35, 350\n99, 686\n\u00d7 100 \u2212 100 = \u221211.26% (6)\nTable 12.

Saved Electricity Fee\nThere are two kinds of electric rates: demand charge and energy charge. Demand charge is for the\nmeasured peak, and energy charge is different in each season. Time periods are divided into summer,\nspring/fall, and winter. Exact time periods are shown in Table 13.\nTable 13. Segmentation by season and time [21].\nLoad Time Summer Spring/Fall Winter\nOff-peak load time 23:00\u201309:00 23:00\u201309:00\nMid-load\nTime\n09:00\u201310:00\n12:00\u201313:00\n17:00\u201323:00\n09:00\u201310:00\n12:00\u201317:00\n20:00\u201322:00\nPeak load\nTime\n10:00\u201312:00\n13:00\u201317:00\n10:00\u201312:00\n17:00\u201320:00\n22:00\u201323:00\nElectric rate refers to each type of customer. The General Service rate is classified in General\nService (A) I, General Service (A) II, and General Service (B) is for commercial building customers.\nThese rates are subdivided into High-Voltage A for 3.3\u201366 kV and High-Voltage B ranged over 154 kV.\nBesides, customers can choose option I, option II, or option III depending on the customers\u2019 electricity\nuse time for a month. The High-Voltage A option II of General Service (B) is for the customers who use\nelectricity for 200\u2013500 h per month, and whose contract demand of 300 kW or more. The details are\nshown in Table 14. In the table, the authors considered 1000 KRW as $1 USD for a convenience.\nTable 14.

To\ncalculate the saved fee ratio (SFR), the added fees were also considered. These fees are in Tables 16\nand 17. By (7), the sum of added fees was $4127.892, and the SFR was calculated as \u221210.15%. This\nnegative value means that the electricity fee was reduced by 10.15%, while a positive value indicates\nan increase.\nFeeadd = Chargedemand + Chargeenergy (7)\nSFR(%) =\nFee2015 \u2212 Feeadd\nFee2014\n\u00d7 100 \u2212 100 (8)\nSFR(%) =\n15, 924 \u2212 4, 127.892\n13, 128\n\u00d7 100 \u2212 100 = \u221210.15% (9)\nAlthough there was no early target for fee reduction, the analysis of electricity fees is enough to\nprove the effects of the Smart Grid Station.\nTable 15.

Economic Analysis of Smart Grid Station\nIn Section 5, we studied the contribution with regard to the economic aspects of the contributions\nof by PV generation and EV, and the energy time shifting by the ESS. The monthly measurement\nperiod was from the first day of each month to the last day. The used data was measured by the OS.\n5.1. Saved Electricity Fees by PV Generation\nDuring August and September of 2015, PV generation was 2961.5 kWh in August and 2326.1 kWh\nin September. The total saved fee is the sum of saved demand charge (SDC) and saved energy charge\n(SEC) contributed by the PV system.\nSDC = PMaxPCS (kW)\u00d7 Chargedemand (10)\n49\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3512\nSEC = WDER(kWh)\u00d7 Chargeenergy (11)\nIt is difficult to know when the PV system generated power and how much the system generated.\nFor this reason, the authors assumed the PV supplied power to loads at peak-load time and mid-load\ntime in ratio of 8 to 2. Using this, the SDC and the SEC in August were found as follows:\nSDC = 30 kW \u00d7 $8.32/kW = $249.6 (12)\nSECAug = 2961.5 kWh \u00d7 ($0.1911/kWh \u00d7 0.8 + $0.109/kWh \u00d7 0.2) = $517.374 (13)\nSECSept = 2326.1 kWh \u00d7 ($0.1093/kWh \u00d7 0.8 + 0.0786/kWh \u00d7 0.2) = $239.96 (14)\nThe SDC values from September were the same as those from August. Likewise, the SEC values\nfrom September are in (14). In conclusion, the total saved fees were $1256.534.\n5.2. Running Cost Reduction by EV\nThere was one electric vehicle in 2015, and the running data is in Table 18. In August and\nSeptember, the EV ran for 470 km and 345 km, respectively. We assumed the fuel efficiency of a\ngasoline-powered car is 10 km/L. Referring to the data, we compared the running cost (RC) of the EV\nwith that of a gasoline-powered vehicle.\nRCGas =\nmileage (kW)\nkm/L\n\u00d7 PriceGasoline (15)\nRCEV = WEVcharge \u00d7 PriceW (16)\nBy substituting figures, the results were as follows:\nRCAugGas =\n470 kW\n10 km/L\n\u00d7 $1.56/L = $73.32 (17)\nRCAugEV = 105.8 kWh \u00d7 $0.109/kWh \u223c= $11.533 (18)\nRCSeptGas =\n345 kW\n10 km/L\n\u00d7 $1.59/L = $54.855 (19)\nRCSeptEV = 68.4 kWh \u00d7 $0.786/kWh \u223c= $5.377 (20)\nTable 18. Running data of EV in 2015.\nMonth Mileage\nEV Charge Amount\n(kWh)\nPrice of 1 kWh\n($/kWh)\nPrice of Gasoline 1\n($/L)\nAug 470 km 105.8 $0.109 $1.56\nSept 345 km 68.4 $0.0786 $1.59\n1 The price of gasoline is the average value of the month.\nAccording to (17) and (18), $61.787 were saved, which means about 84.3% of the running cost\nwas saved by the EV in August. Equations (19) and (20) also show that $49.478\u2014about 90.2% of the\ncost\u2014was saved in September. Although the actual amount saved was small, this shows that the EV\nwas much more effective than a gasoline-powered vehicle.\n5.3. Saved Fee by ESS Scheduling\nA customer charges the battery of the ESS at night, when the price of electricity is low, and\ndischarges the power at the peak load time or mid-load time when the price is high. However, the\npower from the PV system does not charge the battery but supplies power to the building load directly\n50\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3512\nin the summer to maximize the efficiency. In August, 758.9 kWh was charged to the battery, and the\nsame amount was discharged. In September, 541.1 kWh was charged and discharged. We also adapted\nthe same assumption that the ratio of 8 to 2 stated in Section 5.1. Equation (21) is a formula to calculate\nthe fee reduction (FR). Time of use (TOU) applied in this equation is an electricity fee policy that varies\nwith seasons and times, as shown in Table 14.\nFR =\n(\nWdischarge \u00d7 TOU\n)\n\u2212\n(\nWcharge \u00d7 f eeo f f\u2212peak\n)\n(21)\nBy substituting figures, the results were as follows:\nFRAug = (758.9 \u00d7 (0.1911 \u00d7 0.8 + 0.109 \u00d7 0.2))\u2212 (758.9 \u00d7 0.0561) \u223c= $89.991 (22)\nFRSept = (541.1 \u00d7 (0.1093 \u00d7 0.8 + 0.786 \u00d7 0.2))\u2212 (541.1 \u00d7 0.0561) \u223c= $26.465 (23)\nAs the calculations show, $116.456 was saved for two months. By load shifting, the cost of\nelectricity was greatly reduced.\n5.4. Economic Feasibility on Investment Cost\nThe economic benefits in 2015 are estimated in Table 19. The total construction cost was $174,542\nwhich consisted of the purchasing, installation, and operation costs of all systems: PV, ESS, OS, BAS,\nAMI, smart outlets, smart lights, and smart distribution boards.\nTable 19. Savings report in 2015.\nInvestment Expectation Measured Amount Saved Fee (USD)\nPV generation $51,000 USD 25,200 kWh 27,296 kWh\n$6376\nESS discharge\n$10,500 USD (PCS)\n12,540 kWh 8430 kWh\n$30,000 USD (BAT)\nROI(%) =\nTotal Net Return\nInvestment\n=\n$6376 \u00d7 20 years\n$174, 542\n\u00d7 100% \u223c= 73% (24)\nThe economic feasibility can be evaluated by calculating the return on investment (ROI). The\nnet benefit in 2015 was $6376, and we assumed total net return based on the net benefit in 2015 as\nlife expectancy of the installed devices was expected as 20 years. By (24), the ROI was calculated\nas approximately 73%. This value may seem that its benefit is low, but additional profits were not\nconsidered such as a CO2 reduction, effect by BAS, a tax incentive, the renewable energy certificate,\nthe avoided costs of the generation facilities and the transmission and distribution facilities, because\nthere were constraints on the request for the indices to KEPCO. Thus, we simply appraised the benefits\nof the system. When the SGS in Guri branch office which was the first demonstration was constructed,\nthe unit cost of the PV system was $2550/kW, that of the PCS was $350/kW, and that of the battery\nwas $600/kWh. However, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) [25], the\nunit cost of a commercial PV system was $1620/kW ($1.62 per watt) in 2017. Also, Bloomberg New\nEnergy Finance in [26] described the unit cost of a Li-ion battery as $273/kWh in 2016. As a result,\nwe expect that the SGS solution is much more economical than when the first demonstration was\nimplemented. Based on the effects, the KEPCO had established 121 Smart Grid Stations as of 2016.\n6. Discussion\nIn this paper, the authors studied the first demonstration of a Smart Grid Station in the Guri\nbranch office of KEPCO to prove its effectiveness. The authors verified the performance and economic\nfeasibility of the SGS to propose a future strategy. The performance was evaluated with regard to three\n51\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3512\naspects: peak shaving, reduction of power consumption, and electricity fee savings. The economic\nefficiency was feasible in terms of electricity fee and running cost of an EV. Measured values in 2015\nwere revised for objective comparisons with values in 2014 before the SGS was built.\nThe early main targets were 5% reduction of peak, 9.6% reduction of consumption, and savings\nin electricity fees. To evaluate the performance objectively, we compared the factors in 2015 with\nthe values in 2014, while considering the increased loads in 2015. As described in Section 4, the\nperformance for peak shaving was calculated as 5.40%. This means that the 5% of peak shaving as one\nof early targets was accomplished. Next, the power consumption was reduced by 11.26%. The savings\nin electricity fees did not have a specific target, but they were reduced by 10.15%. These benefits to\nearly targets are arranged in Table 20.\nTable 20. Comparisons of early targets with performance.\nPeak Consumption Electricity Fee\nEarly target 5.0% 9.6% -\nPerformance 5.40% 11.26% 10.15%\nAn economic analysis was conducted in Section 5. We considered the saved electricity fees by the\nPV generation, the reduced running cost by the EV, and the saved fees by ESS scheduling. The saved\nelectricity fees by PV were $1256.534, which is the sum of saved energy charge and demand charge for\ntwo months. The reduced running cost by the use of an EV was calculated by comparing an EV to\na gasoline vehicle. The running cost for the EV was cheaper than the cost of the gasoline vehicle by\nabout 90.2%. Additionally, the ESS contributed to savings in the electricity fees of $116.456 for two\nmonths by load shifting. This means that the greater the capacity of ESS, the greater the savings. Based\non the savings by PV and ESS, we calculated the ROI as approximately 73% which may seem low.\nHowever, we considered only few benefits because of the constraints. Moreover, due to the gradually\ndecreasing unit price of each system annually, the ROI may be higher at present.\n7. Conclusions\nAccording to our analysis, the early targets were accomplished, and the effectiveness of the SGS\nwas proven. Considering the proved effectiveness, the KEPCO has already installed SGSs in 121 of its\nbranch offices, and the possibility of applying the technology to other buildings was also proved. We\nalso suggest the commercialization of the SGS. By expanding, the SGS will contribute to encouraging\nthe industry and to build a smart city, which is a city-sized energy solution. This could come from\nsupporting price policies for devices, and private businesses will participate in the industries actively.\nTo support the expansion of the SG, the convenience, safety, and efficiency of the SGS should be also\nimproved for customers. Also, improvement of the OS would allow the system to integrate and control\nmore and various devices and technologies. As a next step, the authors will study the Smart Town,\nwhich is a town-sized energy solution composed of various kinds of buildings founded in the KEPCO\nAcademy in 2016.\nAuthor Contributions: J.W. designed and wrote the paper.

To implement them in a large scale, broad acceptance in\nsocieties is crucial. However, a growing body of research has revealed societal concerns with these\ntechnologies. To achieve sustainable energy systems, such concerns should be taken into account\nin the development of smart grid technologies. In this paper, we show that many concerns are\nrelated to moral values such as privacy, justice, or trust. We explore the effect of moral values on\nthe acceptance of smart grid technologies. The results of our systematic literature review indicate\nthat moral values can be both driving forces and barriers for smart grid acceptance. We propose that\nfuture research striving to understand the role of moral values as factors for social acceptance can\nbenefit from an interdisciplinary approach bridging literature in ethics of technology with technology\nacceptance models.\nKeywords: smart grid; smart energy; sustainability; values; technology acceptance; technology adoption\n1. Introduction\nDriven by climate change mitigation and transition to low carbon energy systems, governments\nworldwide have set targets to increase the use of renewable energy sources. The 2030 European\nenergy targets include a minimum 27% share of renewable energy consumption [1]. Growing shares of\nrenewables, particularly from wind and solar energy, lead to rising intermittencies of energy supply\nand to a larger number of small and decentralized generation sites. Growing intermittencies and\ndecentralization, however, lead to challenges for balancing supply and demand in networks that were\ndesigned for relatively few large and controllable power plants [2,3].\nSmart grid technologies are praised as one solution to support the integration of rising shares\nof renewable energy sources into power networks and are thus seen as essential in the transition\nto sustainable energy systems [2,4]. They allow accounting for higher supply intermittencies\nand decentralization by using innovative information and communication technologies (ICT).\nFor consumers, they contribute to increased information and awareness of energy use, potentially\nenabling energy savings [5]. As such, smart grids can be a promising solution to reducing greenhouse\ngas emissions in the electricity system while at the same time dealing with rising energy costs [6].\nAlthough the concept of smart grid technologies comprises many technological applications and\nlacks a single definition, widely accepted definitions include efficient management of intermittent\nsupply, two-way communication between producers and consumers, and the use of innovative ICT\nsolutions [7,8].\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2703; doi:10.3390/su10082703 www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability55\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2703\nIn spite of their promising benefits for low-carbon energy systems, several challenges are\nassociated with smart grid technologies. Next to concerns about high costs as well as uncertain\ninvestment and regulatory environments, moral values underlie many societal concerns [9].\nConcerns about data privacy and security have already delayed smart meter introductions in Europe\nand the US [10,11]. The possibility to share end-users\u2019 energy consumption data automatically and\nin (near) real time with grid operators and store these data in central databases raises concerns that\nenergy companies could use this data to get insight into activities in a household that are considered\nas private [12]. Related to storing sensitive data in central databases are fears that these data could\nbe threatened by cyberattacks and used in a harmful way. Additionally, consumer fears of reduced\nautonomy are reflected in concerns that smart meters or smart household appliances might give energy\ncompanies more control over a household\u2019s electricity use [13]. Further concerns that energy suppliers\nwill not be transparent about benefits and pass financial savings on to their customers relate to the\nvalues of trust and a fair distribution of costs and benefits [14].\nChallenges in the smart grid development which are related to moral values need to be addressed\nto achieve sustainable energy systems and might hinder the wider acceptance and adoption of smart\ngrid technologies. There is an extensive literature on factors influencing technology acceptance and\nadoption in the field of technology and innovation management [15,16], and social psychology [17,18].\nInnovation management scholars emphasize market acceptance, which is determined largely by\nenvironmental and market-specific factors, the characteristics of the technology itself, and firm-level\ncharacteristics [19\u201321]. Theories in social psychology, on the other hand, concentrate on individual\nuser acceptance, with models stressing the importance of technology specific beliefs, social influences,\nand personality beliefs as factors for acceptance [17,18,22]. Although these bodies of literature focus\non a wide range of potential factors for acceptance, moral values\u2014characteristics of a technology with\nethical importance [23]\u2014are typically not included in these factors. Given that moral values underlie\nsocietal concerns uttered in public debates, there is a need for research that addresses how moral\nvalues impact the acceptance of smart grid technologies. This paper therefore aims at exploring this\nrelationship. It addresses the questions which moral values are relevant for the acceptance of smart\ngrid technologies and how these values influence smart grid acceptance. The paper contributes to\nthe development of sustainable smart grid technologies. To achieve sustainability, it is important not\nonly to consider environmental impacts such as carbon emissions but also social and ethical impacts\nsuch as privacy and justice. We stress the importance of social and ethical aspects for sustainability by\nemphasizing the role of moral values for smart grid technologies.\nThe paper is structured as follows: The next section provides a theoretical background on\nmoral values drawing from the field of ethics of technology, as well as factors for technology\nacceptance and adoption drawing from technology and innovation management, and social psychology.\nSections 3 and 4 contain the methodology and results of a systematic literature review on values\nassociated with the acceptance of smart grid technologies. The two final sections are devoted to\ndiscussions and conclusions.\n2. Theoretical Perspectives\n2.1. Ethics of Technology\nMoral values are evident in societal concerns about smart grid technologies. Ethics of technology\nis the major field concerned with moral values and technologies. Moral values are used to make\nstatements about ethical and social consequences of technologies. Although an unanimously agreed\nupon definition of the term \u2018moral values\u2019 is lacking, they often refer to abstract principles and\n\u201cgeneral convictions and beliefs that people should hold paramount if society is to be good\u201d [24]\n(p. 1343). They are considered to be intersubjectively shared, which means they are principles that\ndifferent individuals can relate to and generally hold important [24,25]. As such, moral values relate\n56\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2703\nto convictions of what is perceived as good and bad that are shared by members of a society [26].\nTypical examples of importance for technologies are health, well-being, safety, or justice [23,27].\nEvaluations of technologies with respect to ethical and social consequences are grounded in the\nunderstanding that technologies are not neutral objects, but value-laden [28,29]. That means that\nthey are capable of endorsing or harming values [30]. Winner [30] gives the much-cited example of\nvery low overpasses over the only highway connecting New York with Long Island Beach, thereby\nhindering public busses (the main method of transportation for less well-off societal groups including\nracial minorities) to access the beach. The example is often used to illustrate the moral importance\nof technological design [29,31]. Moral considerations of technological design are especially relevant\nas technologies do usually not only fulfill the specific function they are designed for, but also have\npositive and negative side effects [32].\nFor the design of technologies, moral values are (perceived) technology characteristics that go\nbeyond functional requirements and address requirements of ethical importance such as justice,\ntrust, privacy and more [28,33]. They are seen as identifiable entities that should be considered in\ndesign or be embedded in technologies. To embed value in technologies through design choices,\nValue Sensitive Design (VSD) scholars follow a tripartite approach [28,33]. The approach consists of\niterative conceptual, empirical, and technical investigations (for a detailed description of the approach,\nsee for example [27,34,35]). Conceptual investigations are applied to find out what values are relevant,\nand to identify indirect and direct stakeholders as well as reflections on how to deal with value\nconflicts. Empirical investigations focus on the stakeholders as unit of analysis in order to get insights\ninto their interpretation and prioritization of different values. Technical investigations focus on the\ntechnology itself to identify which technological features support or harm which values. They refer to\nthe \u201ctranslation\u201d of abstract values into concrete design requirements of the technology.\nVSD scholars strive for an in-depth understanding of moral values and the design of technologies\nthat are \u201cbetter\u201d from an ethical standpoint. Their research aim is focused on integrating convictions\n\u201cthat people should hold paramount if society is to be good\u201d [24] (p. 1343) into the design of\ntechnologies. Hence, their research aim does typically not include testing effects of their design\non social acceptance of technologies.\n2.2. Technology Acceptance and Adoption\nAcceptance of novel energy technologies is typically defined in terms of perceptions of\nstakeholders involved in energy projects [36]. Acceptance can range from passive consent with novel\ntechnologies to more active approval such as taking action to promote a technology [37]. Adoption of\ntechnologies is defined as the behavior to purchase and use a technology [38]. Adoption can therefore\nbe measured through e.g., market share. Some scholars include behavior towards energy technologies\nin their definition of \u201cacceptance.\u201d When acceptance is defined as purchase/use, \u201cacceptability\u201d is\nsometimes used to refer to positive attitudes towards technologies (e.g., [39\u201341]). For the purpose of\nthis research, the definition of acceptance includes the purchase or use of a technology.\nVarious scholars have focused on factors that affect acceptance of technologies, particularly in the\nfields of technology and innovation management, and social psychology (Table 1).\n2.2.1. Technology and Innovation Management\nScholars in the area of technology and innovation management take a market and firm perspective\ntowards factors for technology acceptance and adoption [15,16,19\u201321,42,43]: Factors pertain to\nenvironmental and market-specific factors, the characteristics of the technology itself, and firm-level\ncharacteristics [16,44].\nWithin environmental and market-specific factors, a strong emphasis is put on network\neffects. Network effects are positive consumption externalities that occur when the utility of\na technology for one consumer increases with the number of other consumers that have adopted the\ntechnology [15,19,20,44]. In addition, a high diversity in the inter-organizational network, which is\n57\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2703\nthe extent to which stakeholders from different industries are involved in developing and marketing\na technology, is beneficial for technology adoption [16,45,46].\nTable 1. Overview of factors for technology acceptance/adoption.\nType of Factors Factors (Examples)\nTechnology & Innovation\nManagement\nSocial Psychology\nEnvironmental and\nmarket characteristics\nNetwork effects, switching costs, installed base,\nregulators, suppliers\n\u221a\nTechnology-specific characteristics Technological superiority, complementarygoods, compatibility\n\u221a\nFirm-level characteristics Financial strength, brand reputation, pricingstrategy, time of market entry\n\u221a\nPerceived technology-specific\ncharacteristics\nPerformance and effort expectancy, cost-benefit\nperceptions, hedonic motivations\n\u221a\nPerceived social influences Subjective norm, image\n\u221a\nPerceived personality characteristics Personal norms, ecologicalworldviews, innovativeness\n\u221a\nOthers Experience, habit\n\u221a\nRelated to characteristics of the technology, the extent to which a given technology performs\nsuperior to competing technologies (i.e., its technological superiority) is generally regarded as beneficial\nfor its adoption [20]. In addition, a greater availability and variety of complementary goods has\na positive effect on adoption [15,19,47].\nIn addition, firm-level characteristics are found to impact technology adoption. The financial\nstrength of the firm in terms of the availability of appropriate financial resources to develop and market\nthe technology [48], the brand reputation and credibility [16], and a strong learning orientation from\npast experiences [15] are beneficial for the firm\u2019s specific technology to become adopted. Several factors\nare related to the firms\u2019 strategic choices connected to the introduction of the technology, such as the\npricing strategy and timing of market entry [15,16].\n2.2.2. Social Psychology\nWhereas technology management scholars focus on a firm or market perspective,\nsocial psychologists concentrate on individual user acceptance. Among the most prominent theories\nare the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) [22], the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) [49],\nand its advancements to the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) [17,50],\nthe Norm Activation Model (NAM) [51,52], or the Value-Belief-Norm theory (VBN) [18]. (Note that\nthe term \u201cvalues\u201d in this context needs differentiation from moral values in an ethics of technology\ncontext. Value orientations or values are referred to in social psychology as individuals\u2019 personality\ncharacteristics [53]. Moral values in an ethics of technology context are perceived characteristics of the\ntechnology [33].)\nFactors for technology acceptance can be categorized as technology-specific beliefs,\nsocial influences, and personality beliefs. Technology-specific beliefs include beliefs that a technology\nwill be useful and enhance the achievement of a consumer\u2019s goal (performance expectancy) and\nperceptions of the ease of use associated with a technology (effort expectancy) [17,49]. Consumers are\nalso more likely to adopt a technology if they perceive facilitating conditions, including the support\navailable to use a technology [17,22]. Monetary aspects are considered in terms of the perceived\ntrade-off between costs and gains. Finally, hedonic motivations (expected fun, enjoyment) are also\nfound to positively impact acceptance [17,54].\nSocial influences\u2014interchangeably used with subjective norm [22], and image [50]\u2014cover\nperceptions that important others such as family and friends believe they should use a technology and\nthe belief that the use will enhance their social status [17].\nPersonality-specific beliefs mostly refer to the role of personal norms as factors for\npro-environmental behavior. They play a prominent role in the Norm Activation Model (NAM) [51,52]\n58\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2703\nand the Value-Belief-Norm theory (VBN) [18]. Personal norms are perceptions about one\u2019s moral\nobligation to take pro-environmental actions [18,40]. They are shaped by ecological worldviews,\nwhich are general beliefs about the relationship between humans and the environment [40].\nScholars also combine models focusing on technology-specific beliefs such as TPB and TAM with\nmodels focusing on personality-beliefs such as NAM. Broman Toft et al. [38] for example combine\nTAM with NAM and show that if smart grid technologies are perceived as useful and easy to use,\nconsumers are likely to show stronger personal norms to use the technology. Huijts et al. [41] posit\nthat perceived costs and benefits\u2014elements from TBP\u2014impact personal norms, which is a concept\nfrom NAM.\n3. Method\nTo understand the role of moral values for the acceptance of smart grid technologies in greater\ndetails, we conducted a systematic literature review. We analyzed journal articles reporting the results\nof empirical studies to ensure capturing original research results. Articles were retrieved from the\ndatabases Scopus and Web of Science (see Table 2 for the full search queries). To capture a diverse\nrange of smart grid technologies, search terms included smart grid, smart energy, smart metering,\nsmart home, home energy management, energy and digitalization, and smart technology. Acceptance,\nacceptability, and adoption were used as search terms, because, as outlined in Section 2.2, these are\ncommon concepts which are often used interchangeably to study social acceptance of emerging\ntechnologies (e.g., [36\u201341]). An initial screening of relevant publications revealed that the term \u201cvalues\u201d\nis often not mentioned explicitly, even when moral values were included as factors for smart grid\nacceptance [2,55\u201358]. To ensure capturing all relevant publications, the term \u201cvalues\u201d was therefore\nnot included in our search terms.\nTable 2.

After removing duplicates,\nthe 532 unique search results were screened based on their abstracts. Articles that solely focused on\ntechnical issues or did not report results of empirical studies were excluded. As a result, for example,\na study by Park et al. [59] was eligible for further analysis because it investigated consumer acceptance\nof a home energy management system. In contrast, a study by Vagropoulos et al. [60] was excluded\nbecause it presented an optimization model and did not empirically assess the acceptance of smart grid\ntechnologies. This abstract screening resulted in a total of 103 relevant articles, which were subsequently\n59\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2703\nanalyzed with respect to moral values as factors for smart grid acceptance. In the analysis, we searched\nfor values of ethical importance often mentioned in the VSD literature. In addition, we aimed to find\nadditional values that were reported in empirical smart grid studies but not included in prior literature.\nApart from identifying values, we analyzed their conceptualizations, the relevant stakeholder group,\nthe technical context, and applied methodologies. The analysis resulted in a group of 49 papers\nthat reported moral values as factors for smart grid acceptance (see Appendix A) and a group of\n54 studies that did not include moral values as factors for smart grid acceptance (for example a study\nby Kobus et al. [61] focusing on the role of smart appliances to bring about electricity demand shift by\nresidential households).\nFigure 1. Flow diagram for systematic literature review (Based on [62]).\n4. Results\nOur literature review reveals that moral values can act as factors for smart grid acceptance;\nmoral values were found in 49 articles on smart grid acceptance (see Appendix A). These articles\nwere published in 23 different journals. However, more than 50% are concentrated in four journals:\nEnergy Research & Social Science and Energy Policy were the most frequent journals, with 10 and nine\npublications respectively, followed by four publications in Energy Efficiency and three publications in\nRenewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews. The journals cover a large diversity of subject areas, including\nenergy research, environmental science, engineering, business and management research, computer\nscience, psychology, and philosophy. (Journals have been mapped to subject areas based on their\ncategorizations in Scopus and Web of Science.)\n60\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2703\nThe most prevalent subject area was energy research: 32 out of 49 articles were published in\nthis field. A smaller number of articles were published in the three subject areas that can provide the\ntheoretical background to understand the role of values for social acceptance and were reviewed earlier.\nFirst, this concerns ethics of technology: two articles were published in journals within the subject area\nof philosophy (Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society, and Public Understanding of\nScience). Second, three articles were published in journals that contribute to the field of technology\nand innovation management, such as Technological Forecasting and Social Change. Third, a total of\n18 publications are from journals where theories on technology acceptance from social psychology are\nwidely used, for example the Journal of Consumer Policy and Psychology & Marketing, but also Energy\nResearch & Social Science.\nTwenty-five studies with qualitative approaches exploring smart grid acceptance used\npredominantly expert interviews, focus groups, public workshops, and in-depth interviews,\nwhile 27 studies used quantitative methodologies to test the impact of various values on\nacceptance or adoption (three publications rely both on qualitative and quantitative methodologies).\nTwelve publications tested consumer acceptance of smart grid technologies based on technology\nacceptance models used in social psychology. The other 14 articles using quantitative methods derived\ntheir own antecedents of smart grid acceptance.\nIn the 49 publications, a range of moral values have emerged as factors for acceptance or adoption\nof various smart grid technologies (Table 3). These values were reported either as drivers or barriers of\nsmart grid acceptance/adoption. A value is classified as a \u201cdriver\u201d if it provides impulse, motivation,\nor reason for smart grid introduction or if smart grid technologies are perceived to have a positive\ninfluence on these values. A value is identified as a \u201cbarrier\u201d if it is expressed as concerns or if there is\na perceived fear that the technology might have adverse consequences for this specific value.\nThe drivers of smart grid acceptance were environmental sustainability, security of supply, and\ntransparency. Data privacy, data security, (mis)trust, health, justice, and reliability were found as\nbarriers to smart grid acceptance. Control, inclusiveness, quality of life, and affordability were partly\nidentified as driver and partly as barrier. All of these values emerged in studies using inductive\nqualitative approaches. Most of them were also included in quantitative studies, with the exception of\ndistributive justice, inclusiveness, quality of life, and transparency.\nThe majority of these values are relevant for citizen or consumer acceptance. Only seven articles\nreport values relevant for office workers, manufacturing companies, energy companies, or the society\nat large. While values for office workers are similar to consumers\u2019 concerns (trust and quality of life or\ncomfort), the values reported for companies and the societies in general are the main drivers for smart\ngrid development: environmental sustainability and security of supply.\n61\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2703\nT\na\nb\nle\n3\n.\nV\nal\nue\ns\nre\nle\nva\nnt\nfo\nr\nth\ne\nac\nce\npt\nan\nce\nof\nsm\nar\ntg\nri\nd\nte\nch\nno\nlo\ngi\nes\n.\nV\na\nlu\ne\ns\n#\no\nf\nA\nrt\nic\nle\ns\n(N\n=\n4\n9\n)\nT\ne\nch\nn\no\nlo\ng\nic\na\nl\nC\no\nn\nte\nx\nt\nS\no\nu\nrc\ne\ns\nS\nm\na\nrt\nG\nri\nd\nS\nm\na\nrt\nM\ne\nte\nri\nn\ng\nS\nm\na\nrt\nH\no\nm\ne\nD\nS\nM\nH\no\nu\nse\nh\no\nld\nS\nto\nra\ng\ne\nS\nm\na\nrt\nE\nV\nC\nh\na\nrg\nin\ng\nEn\nvi\nro\nnm\nen\nta\nlS\nus\nta\nin\nab\nili\nty\n22\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n[1\n1,\n56\n\u20135\n9,\n63\n\u20137\n9]\nSe\ncu\nri\nty\nof\nSu\npp\nly\n7\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n[3\n,6\n7\u2013\n69\n,7\n2,\n78\n,7\n9]\nTr\nan\nsp\nar\nen\ncy\nan\nd\nA\ncc\nur\nac\ny\n6\n+\n+\n+\n[5\n6,\n58\n,6\n7,\n76\n,7\n7,\n80\n]\nPr\niv\nac\ny\n24\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n[2\n,1\n1,\n14\n,5\n5,\n56\n,5\n8,\n63\n,7\n4\u2013\n77\n,7\n9,\n81\n\u20139\n2]\nSe\ncu\nri\nty\n15\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n[2\n,1\n1,\n55\n,6\n8,\n74\n\u20137\n7,\n79\n,8\n1,\n85\n,8\n6,\n89\n,9\n2,\n93\n]\n(M\nis\n)T\nru\nst\n14\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n[1\n4,\n63\n,7\n5,\n76\n,8\n1,\n83\n,9\n0\u2013\n92\n,9\n4\u2013\n98\n]\nH\nea\nlt\nh\n5\n\u2212\n[1\n1,\n56\n,6\n8,\n86\n,9\n1]\nD\nis\ntr\nib\nut\niv\ne\nan\nd\nPr\noc\ned\nur\nal\nJu\nst\nic\ne\n5\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n[1\n4,\n56\n,5\n7,\n75\n,9\n6]\nC\non\ntr\nol\nan\nd\nA\nut\non\nom\ny\n14\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+/\n\u2212\n+/\n\u2212\n[1\n4,\n55\n,5\n6,\n66\n,6\n7,\n73\n,7\n9,\n81\n,8\n8,\n93\n,9\n4,\n99\n\u20131\n01\n]\nIn\ncl\nus\niv\nen\nes\ns\n7\n\u2212\n+/\n\u2212\n[1\n4,\n75\n\u20137\n7,\n79\n,8\n1,\n93\n]\nQ\nua\nlit\ny\nof\nLi\nfe\n7\n+\n\u2212\n[5\n8,\n66\n,7\n3,\n75\n\u20137\n7]\nR\nel\nia\nbi\nlit\ny\n5\n+/\n\u2212\n[7\n5,\n77\n,7\n9\u2013\n81\n]\nA\nff\nor\nda\nbi\nlit\ny\nof\nen\ner\ngy\n4\n+/\n\u2212\n+/\n\u2212\n\u2212\n[1\n1,\n71\n,7\n6,\n99\n]\n+:\nD\nri\nve\nr;\n\u2212:\nBa\nrr\nie\nr;\n+/\n\u2212:\nm\nen\nti\non\ned\nbo\nth\nas\ndr\niv\ner\nan\nd\nba\nrr\nie\nr\nde\npe\nnd\nin\ng\non\nst\nud\ny;\nre\nfe\nr\nto\nte\nxt\nfo\nr\nde\nta\nils\n;D\nSM\n:D\nem\nan\nd-\nsi\nde\nm\nan\nag\nem\nen\nt;\nEV\n:E\nle\nct\nri\nc\nve\nhi\ncl\ne.\n62\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2703\n4.1. Moral Values That Act as Drivers of Smart Grid Acceptance\nThe most often cited positive driving force (22 publications, [11,56\u201359,63\u201379]) for the acceptance\nof various smart grid technologies was their contribution to the environmental sustainability of\nenergy systems. Environmental sustainability refers to the reduction of emissions from the electricity\nsector, thereby contributing to climate change goals [75,78]. Smart grid technologies contribute to\nenvironmental sustainability by facilitating the integration of renewable energy sources and electric\nvehicles [63,69,72]. In addition, smart metering and smart home networks are perceived by consumers\nto enable them to save energy through better visualization of the energy consumption of various\nhousehold appliances, thereby lowering not only energy costs but also emissions [56,57,75].\nAnother key factor positively related to the acceptance of smart grid technologies was the security\nof electricity supply (seven publications, [3,67\u201369,72,78,79]). \u201cSecurity of supply\u201d in the context of\nelectricity systems is defined as a low risk of interruptions in the supply [3]. Given that the electricity\nsystem is vital for the functioning of modern societies, a high security of supply is one of the central\nvalues in any debate on changing energy systems. Smart meters were perceived to enhance the security\nof supply, because they allow detection and reduction of power outages faster than conventional\nmeters [68]. Household electricity storage systems allow to reduce the risk of supply interruptions\nbecause they can serve as a buffer for excess energy and allow to decouple electricity generation from\nconsumption [3]. Smart charging systems allow to shift the charging time of electric vehicles and\nthereby can help to avoid grid overload problems [69,72].\nIn the context of smart metering, smart home, and demand-side management, transparency\nand accuracy were found to be further values motivating the acceptance of such technologies\n(six publications, [56,58,67,76,77,80]). Greater accuracy and a better overview of energy consumption\ndata as well as transparency in the impact of consumption patterns on cost and the environment,\nwhich are enabled through smart meters and in-home displays, contributed positively to the acceptance\nthese technologies [56,58].\n4.2. Moral Values That Form Barriers for Smart Grid Acceptance\nPrivacy was by far the most prevalent moral value reported as a perceived barrier, mentioned\nin 24 publications [2,11,14,55,56,58,63,74\u201377,79,81\u201392]. Concerns about privacy are related to the\nincreased collection and transmission of information on energy consumption compared to traditional\nmeters [2]. Triggered by the possibility to share end-users\u2019 energy consumption data automatically and\nin real time with grid operators and store these data in central databases, consumers are concerned\nthat energy companies could use these data to get insight into activities in a household that are\nconsidered as private [55,56]. Explicitly mentioned was the fear that smart grid technologies could\nallow identification of the type and time of use of household appliances [86]. In addition, consumers\nwere concerned that their personal data could be sold commercially [91]. One study also reported\nthe perceived danger in the effect of combining different pieces of data to reveal more information or\npatterns about consumer behavior that could be extracted from single pieces [75].\nConcerns about data and cyber security were the second most often reported barrier to smart grid,\nsmart metering, and smart home acceptance (15 publications, [2,11,55,68,74\u201377,79,81,85,86,89,92,93]).\nSecurity refers to the existence of mechanisms that ensure that personal data is protected from outside,\nmalicious attacks [2,68]. The increased collection and transmission of more energy consumption data\nthan with \u201cdumb\u201d systems are at the core of security concerns. Consumers are concerned that their\nconsumption data, which is transmitted to e.g., grid operators, might fall into the wrong hands due\nto cyberattacks. They stress the importance of ensuring that personal data is adequately protected\nand encrypted [81,85,89]. In addition, and specifically connected to smart home platforms, consumers\nuttered the fear that outsiders could get more easy access to their private spaces/homes [55].\nTrust, or rather the lack of trust by consumers in organizations charged with the implementation and\nmanagement of smart grid technologies (e.g., electric utilities, governmental authorities), was reported as\none of the key barrier values for smart grid acceptance (14 publications, [14,63,75,76,81,83,90\u201392,94\u201398]).\n63\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2703\nWhile trust was mainly relevant in consumer acceptance studies, one study from the perspective of\nUS utilities revealed that utilities were aware of the problematic (mis)trust by consumers towards their\ncompanies [63]. Consumers\u2019 lack of trust is reflected in concerns that the utilities industry and the\ngovernment (a) are not open about their benefits and (b) will not pass any financial savings on to\ncustomers. Consumers also found it difficult to understand why utilities would promote energy-saving\nmessages while they are perceived to increase profits with an increased energy consumption [76,91,94].\nAdditionally, concerns were related to the degree of trust that the personal data shared through smart\nmeters with energy companies is protected [90,98].\nIn the context of smart metering, consumers perceived health risks were found to be\nnegatively connected to the acceptance and use of smart meters (five publications, [11,56,68,86,91]).\nPerceived health risks refer to the subjective evaluation of potential health threats resulting from an\nevent or an activity [56]. Health risks were connected with exposure to electromagnetic radiation from\nsmart meters [68,86,91]. Whether or not radiation poses objective threats to consumers\u2019 health, the\nfact that smart meters are perceived as health risks in studies on consumer acceptance indicates that\nsuch concerns should be taken seriously by utilities and governmental authorities when introducing\nsmart metering.\nConcerns about the fairness of smart metering and demand-side management reflected the\nvalues of distributive and procedural justice as a barrier for smart grid acceptance from the\nperspective of energy consumers (five publications, [14,56,57,75,96]). Distributive justice refers to a fair\ndistribution of costs and benefits among the key stakeholders involved in these technologies [14,56,57].\nConsumers feared that they will have to bear the costs for the introduction of smart metering without\nreceiving apparent benefits while energy providers would profit from financial savings [57]. In addition,\nthere was a perception that the responsibility for saving energy would be pushed on consumers while\nsupplier obligations to ensure low consumer prices would be neglected [14]. Procedural justice refers\nto fairness in decision making processes, often based on the fact that all relevant stakeholders are able\nto participate in the process. Although this concern was less prevalent than distributive justice, it\nyielded interesting results in a study by Guerreiro et al. [56]. The authors were interested in the use of\nsmart meters combined with an in-home display and found that increased perceptions of procedural\njustice let to decreased use in the devices. It might be that respondents who perceived the process of\nintroduction as being fair felt a lower need to control the equipment.\n4.3. Moral Values with Ambiguous Effects on Smart Grid Acceptance\nControl or autonomy\u2014defined in this context as the perception that one can direct events in life\nfree of outside influence [100]\u2014was related to consumers concerns about loss of control and autonomy\nwith the introduction of smart metering and the installation of smart home platforms. They feared\nlosing control to ICT systems and perceived the monitoring of daily behavior as too intrusive and\nrestrictive [55,81]. Concerns were also directed to a fear of loss of control towards energy suppliers,\nwho might manage their energy consumption for them [14,56]. While control was mostly perceived as\na barrier (12 publications, [14,55,56,67,73,79,81,88,93,94,99,101]), a later study reported a positive effect\nof control on the acceptance of an automated demand-side response tariff [100]. This suggests that\nconcerns about the loss of control play a more ambivalent role than previously assumed. The authors\nexplain the effect with two reasons. Firstly, the tariff\u2019s impact was clearly defined (e.g., the room\ntemperature was only allowed to shift by 1 \u25e6C). Secondly, the option of overriding the automation was\npresented, which might have restored perceptions of self-control [14,100].\nInclusiveness was both seen as a barrier and a driver for smart grid acceptance. Inclusiveness\nrefers to giving all different societal groups the possibility to be included in the technological\ndevelopment. On the one hand, six studies revealed that consumers were concerned that elderly people,\ndisabled people, and people with less affinity to computers and IT systems would be systematically\nexcluded from the smart grid development [14,75,77,79,81,93]. In another study, however, consumers\n64\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2703\nexpressed positive views about the benefits, the support, and the additional services that smart homes\ncould offer in assisted living for the elderly and people with disabilities [76].\nIncreased quality of life was seen as a driver for smart home technologies in six\npublications [58,66,73,75\u201377]. Smart home services such as health monitoring or a remote control\nof security are perceived as practical and automation is seen as enhancing convenience and\ncomfort [73,76]. However, it was reported as a barrier in one study, in which building occupants were\nconcerned with reductions in their living quality as a consequence of demand-side management [102].\nWhen building equipment such as ventilation fans or cooling systems have communication and\ncontrol capabilities to steer the energy demand of the building automatically, the effects on the\nperceived thermal comfort of building occupants was reported as a major concern and barrier for the\nimplementation of such a DSM measure [102].\nThe reliability of novel smart home technologies was questioned and reported as barrier by\nconsumers in four publications [75,77,79,81]. The adoption of non-mainstream technology was seen\nas risky with respect to the malfunctioning of the system, such as a break-down of communication\nsystems or room sensors being triggered unintentionally [75,77]. Consumers felt unease at becoming\nreliant on computer systems they might not fully understand. In addition, concerns were reported\nthat innovations, once adopted, would not widely spread or become rapidly obsolete due to fast\ntechnological progress. This was especially seen problematic when smart home technologies were\nseen as a costly and long-term investment [79]. However, one publication found that in-home displays\nhave the ability to enhance the reliability of an entire home energy management system because such\ndisplays support in discovering system failures or underperformance [80].\nFuture affordability of energy was found to be both a driver and a barrier for the acceptance of\nsmart metering, smart home platforms, and demand-side management. Affordability is the availability\nof financial means to be able to pay for energy. In two studies [11,99], the potential of smart meters and\nsmart home platforms to save energy and prevent energy poverty were seen as reasons to accept these\ntechnologies. In two different studies [71,76], however, consumers were concerned about hidden costs\nand were generally skeptical whether smart grid technologies will indeed reduce their energy bills.\n5. Discussion\nOur literature review on the role of moral values for the acceptance of smart grid technologies\nshowed that values are indeed discussed in the literature on smart grid acceptance and adoption.\nHowever, their relationship with acceptance is not always clear. Whereas certain values are always\nseen as either drivers or barriers, others could be seen as having an ambiguous effect on acceptance.\nWe turn to a more detailed discussion of our findings.\n5.1. Values as Factors for Consumer and Citizen Acceptance\nIn general, our results show that moral values can act as important factors for consumer and\ncitizen acceptance of smart grid technologies. The fact that all the values we found have emerged from\ninductive, qualitative studies indicates that consumers expressed values in an unprompted way as both\ndrivers for smart grid development and concerns around these technologies. Thus, values were not\na priori introduced into these studies by researchers but were expressed by consumers independently.\nIn addition, quantitative studies confirmed for almost all reported values that they influence consumer\nor citizen acceptance. Distributive justice, inclusiveness, quality of life, and transparency were the\nexceptions which were only reported in qualitative studies.\nHowever, our results also show that there are two aspects of values which pose additional\ncomplexities to their investigation as factors for acceptance. First, some values were found to have an\nambiguous effect on acceptance. More specifically, whereas some values were clearly positive forces\ndriving smart grid development (e.g., environmental sustainability) and some were clearly consumer\nconcerns around the technology (e.g., privacy, justice), some were mentioned both as drivers and\nbarriers. For example, studies mentioned the potential of smart grid technologies to save energy and\n65\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2703\nthus save costs as perceived benefits with regards to energy affordability [11,99]. However, consumers\nwere also concerned that they will have to bear the costs for the introduction of smart grid technologies\nthrough higher electricity bills. Another example is inclusiveness; whereas there are concerns that\nseveral societal groups (e.g., the elderly, disabled) would be systematically excluded because of the\nfocus on novel ICT [14], benefits that smart homes in particular could offer in assisted living for the\nelderly and disabled are expressed [76]. Additionally, the value of control was mostly perceived\nas a barrier due to a perceived loss of consumers\u2019 control to electronic devices or energy suppliers.\nAutomated demand-response tariffs were particularly in focus of this concern. However, once the\nimpact of such a tariff was clearly defined, the degree of external control through the tariff was very\nsmall, and consumers had the option to override the automation, the perceived loss of control was no\nlonger a problem [100].\nThese examples illustrate the importance of the detailed technological and regulatory context for\nthe effect direction on acceptance. In the example of control, the way an automated demand-response\ntariff was structured with respect to definition of boundaries of the automation or overriding\npossibilities was decisive whether control was seen as a barrier or not. The debate to what extent smart\nmetering impacts energy affordability depends on the regulation of electricity prices: if smart meters\nenable consumers to save costs by using less energy, these savings might be offset because costs for the\nsmart metering infrastructure are socialized, i.e., paid by consumers through the network tariffs on\nelectricity bills.\nThe examples also illustrate that whether certain values have a positive or negative impact\non smart grid acceptance depends on their interpretation by consumers. Values can therefore be\ncharacterized as \u201ccontestable concepts,\u201d having two levels of meaning [103]. The first level is expressed\nin a short definition; for example, energy affordability is generally defined as having the financial\nmeans to be able to pay for energy. The second level of meaning refers to the value\u2019s conception.\nHere, contestation occurs over how the concept should be interpreted and whether a technology\ncontributes to the value or endangers it [103]. It is thus important to understand values at the level\nof conception, since this is the level where controversies arise and the way values impact technology\nacceptance might depend on their conception [104]. In the example of affordability, the debate is not\nabout the definition or importance of affordability, the debate is whether certain features of smart grid\ntechnologies are perceived to contribute to energy affordability while others do not. As a consequence,\nfuture research should carefully consider different potential conceptions of values when testing their\neffect on acceptance.\nSecond, certain values are closely interrelated, increasing the complexity in deriving their separate\neffects on smart grid acceptance. Probably the most prevalent relationship could be observed between\ndata privacy and security. Both concerns are related to the increased transmission and storing of\npersonal data. They are frequently mentioned in context with each other [2,55,56,76] or even measured\nas one construct (e.g., [84,85]). However, they are different concepts. Privacy refers to the concern\nthat individuals\u2019 personal data can be used externally to infer information about activities that are\nconsidered as private [12]. Security concerns on the other hand are defined in terms of the risk that\npersonal data is subject to malicious external attacks, e.g., through hacking [2]. Their conceptual\ndifferentiation means on the one hand that different measures need to be taken by policy makers\nand industry actors responsible for smart grid introduction to protect consumers\u2019 privacy and data\nsecurity. On the other hand, their conceptual differentiation could imply different effects on consumer\nacceptance. They should therefore be treated as separate concepts in academic studies on smart\ngrid acceptance.\nDistributive justice is connected to affordability concerns. Consumers were concerned that they\nwill have to bear the costs for e.g., the smart meter introduction, whereas energy providers would profit\nfrom financial savings [57]. Consumers perceived an unfairness that smart grid technologies might\nlead to higher energy costs and a lower affordability of energy [56]. As a consequence, concerns about\nfairness and affordability might reinforce each other in their negative effect on smart grid acceptance.\n66\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2703\nIn addition, several values were connected with the perceived trust of consumers in energy\ncompanies and government authorities. Concerns about distributive justice were connected with the\nlack of trust that energy companies are not open about their benefits and would not pass on financial\nsavings to consumers [57,76]. Also, trust was related to privacy and security concerns: Perceived\nconsumer trust about the protection of personal data [98]. This points to the central importance of\ntrust between consumers and authorities or organizations charged with the implementation and\nmanagement of smart grid technologies as potential antecedent for several other values; a relationship\nthat is worth considering in smart grid acceptance studies. Trust is also suggested as antecedent for\nconsumer beliefs by Huijts et al. [41] in their conceptual development of a framework for acceptance\nof energy technologies. Trust is suggested as influencing positive and negative affect, perceived costs,\nrisks and benefits, and also procedural justice.\n5.2. Combining Insights from Ethics with Technology Acceptance Literature\nIn contrast to our results, current theoretical frameworks for technology acceptance and adoption\ndo not seem to pay attention to moral values as factors for acceptance (see Section 2.2). Frameworks\nfor technology acceptance and adoption in technology and innovation management fields focus on\nmarket-, firm-, and technology-specific characteristics [16,21,44]. In social psychology, technology\nacceptance models focus on factors pertaining to technology beliefs, social influences, and personality\nbeliefs [17,18].\nTherefore, we propose that moral values should be included more systematically in studies on the\nacceptance or adoption of smart grid technologies, and potentially technology acceptance in general.\nScientific understanding of the role of values for technology acceptance can be gained by combining\ninsights from ethics of technology with literature on technology acceptance.\nEthics of technology and particularly VSD approaches can be beneficial for the identification\nand conceptualizations of relevant values for a particular technological context. In their tripartite\napproach, VSD scholars place great emphasis on identifying relevant values. They do this both from an\nethical normative perspective and a descriptive perspective relying on the opinions of key stakeholders\ninvolved with a technology [27,33]. In addition, they acknowledge that values can be interpreted and\nprioritized differently by different stakeholder groups and therefore integrate considerations around\nconceptions of values explicitly in their empirical approaches [35,104]. Their in-depth understanding\nof different conceptualization of values can contribute to the two complexities about the relationships\nbetween values and social acceptance we encountered in our results, namely that these relationships\nhinge on detailed interpretations of values and that there are mutual interdependencies between\ndifferent values. Methods of elicitation of technology specific values from VSD can be used by\nresearchers studying smart grid acceptance. This includes what VSD researchers call conceptual\ninvestigations, philosophically informed considerations of how stakeholders might be affected by\nthe technology. It also includes empirical investigations, in which VSD scholars use the entire range\nof qualitative and quantitative empirical methods to answer questions such as how stakeholders\ninterpret different values for the given technological context or which values are prioritized by different\nstakeholder groups affected by the technology [34].\nEthicists and VSD scholars focus on the understanding of values and possibilities to integrate\nthem into technological design. However, their research aims do not include testing whether a design\nfor values increases the acceptance and adoption of technologies. Their approach seems to underlie\nthe implicit proposition that a proper integration of values that are judged as important for the context\nof a specific technology will contribute to enhancing acceptance in society [28].\nThe literature on technology acceptance is complementary to that because it does study the\nimpact of a diverse range of factors on technology acceptance and adoption. Thus, it provides not\nonly rigorous quantitative methods to test relationships but also measurement scales for values and\nacceptance in surveys or experiments [17,40,41].\n67\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2703\nMore specifically, our results indicate that adaptations of technology acceptance models from\nsocial psychology might be suitable to include moral values (see Section 2.2.2 for a review). Half of the\npublications in our systematic literature review including values as factors and using deductive theory\ntesting approaches investigate smart grid acceptance based on models used in social psychology\n(e.g., [3,56,85,98,100]). Although they only include a sub-set of relevant values in their models,\nthese studies provide first indications how to integrate values in acceptance models and which\nother model variables values might be related to.\nMost of these scholars study values as direct antecedents of intentions to use or use of smart grid\ntechnologies. For example, Fell et al. [100] find that control over comfort and timing of activities are\nrelated to intentions to adopt a demand-side management scheme and R\u00f6mer et al. [3] relate security\nof supply concerns to purchase intentions of household storage systems.\nA number of studies show effects of values on several different variables in technology acceptance\nmodels, particularly perceived risk and perceived usefulness or ease of use, concepts that are\nused in both UTAUT and TAM. Chou et al. [85] find that concerns on data privacy and security\nimpact perceived risk. In a similar vein, Guerreiro et al. [56] stress the connection between health\nconcerns and perceived risk. Park et al. [68] find that perceived security of supply and environmental\nsustainability impact perceived usefulness, and perceived security and health concerns affect perceived\nrisk. Perceived usefulness and risk impact in turn impacts intentions to use smart grid technologies.\nThe indication from our results that technology acceptance models from social psychology might\nbe suitable to include moral values is in line with a proposed framework for public acceptance\nof sustainable energy technologies such as wind mills or hydrogen vehicles by Huijts et al. [41].\nThe authors stress the importance of procedural and distributive justice measured as perceived\nfairness of the decision process leading up to the technology\u2019s introduction as well as the perceived\nfair distribution of costs and benefits, affecting attitudes toward the technologies. Additionally,\nthey hypothesize that the degree of trust in actors that are responsible for the technology is seen\nas influencing positive and negative affect, perceived costs, risks and benefits, which in turn affect\nattitudes toward the technologies. Positive attitudes toward technologies are then related to intentions\nto accept and technology acceptance.\n6. Conclusions\nSmart grid technologies are seen as an important enabler in the transition to more sustainable\nenergy systems, but the development has been challenged among others by societal concerns [2,11].\nIn this paper, we showed that societal concerns about smart grid technologies reflect moral values,\nwhich are (perceived) technology characteristics about ethical and social consequences of technologies\nsuch as justice, trust, or privacy. We proposed that concerns related to moral values might hinder\nthe wider acceptance and adoption of smart grid technologies. The paper set out to address the\nquestions which moral values are relevant for smart grid technologies and how they influence smart\ngrid acceptance.\nOur results show that moral values can act as drivers and barriers for consumer and citizen\nacceptance of smart grid technologies. On the one hand, values such as environmental sustainability\nand security of supply positively influence smart grid acceptance. On the other hand, concerns\nabout privacy, security, or health negatively impact their acceptance. In addition, several values\nwere mentioned both as driving factors for smart grid acceptance and as concerns (e.g., affordability,\ninclusiveness). Studying the impact of values on acceptance is not only made complex by these\nambiguous interpretations, but also by instrumental relationships between certain values such as\naffordability and distributive justice. It is thus important to consider the detailed technological and\nregulatory context, the nature of values as contestable concepts, and interdependencies between them.\nBased on our results, we propose that future research should strive for a better understanding\nof the role of moral values as factors for smart grid acceptance in order to contribute to embedding\nvalues in smart grid design. This can be done by bridging literature from ethics of technology with\n68\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2703\ntechnology acceptance. Ethicists study in depth which values are implied in certain technologies.\nIn their focus on a normative perspective, however, they do not relate values to the empirical acceptance\nof technologies [28]. Technology acceptance studies provide a complementary perspective because\nthey test the impact of a wide range of factors on acceptance, yet typically without considering values\nas factors [15\u201318]. The results of our systematic literature review show that especially acceptance\nmodels widely used in social psychology such as TAM, TPB, or UTAUT offer a good foundation to\nstudy the effect of values as perceived technology characteristics on smart grid acceptance.\nAuthor Contributions: The article\u2019s concept and main message were developed in joint discussions.

Firstly, the Analytic Hierarchy Process method is used to calculate the weights of evaluation\nindices of effect layer and then the indices of development demand are used to modify the weights\nof them. The association analysis and the correlation coefficient are used to establish the weights\nconduction coefficient between the effect level and the base level. Then the subjective weights of\nthe indices of the base layer are calculated. The objective weights of the indices of the base layer are\nobtained by using the entropy method. The subjective weights of the base layer and the objective\nweights obtained by the entropy method are averagely calculated, and the comprehensive weights\nof the evaluation indices of the base layer are obtained. Then each index is scored according to the\nweights and index values. Finally, the model is used to quantitatively inspect the level of development\nof smart grid in specific regions and make a horizontal comparison, which provides a useful reference\nfor the development of smart grids. The relevant examples verify the correctness and validity of\nthe model.\nKeywords: smart grid; differentiation; development demand; comprehensive evaluation\n1. Introduction\nBased on an integrated and high-speed bi-directional communication network, smart grid is\ndesigned to be reliable, safe, economical, efficient, and environment-friendly through advanced sensing\nand measurement technologies, equipment technologies, control methods, and decision support system\ntechnologies. Key features of it include self-healing, motivating and engaging users, defending against\nattacks, providing power quality that meets 21st century user needs, allowing access to a variety of\npower generation forms, activating power markets, and optimizing asset applications for efficient\noperation. As for its application range, it is more and more extensive. For example, in recent years,\nsome areas have combined smart grids with intelligent transportation to build new smart cities [1].\nAs an important part of the energy internet, it has drawn wide attention from all of the world and has\nnow become a new trend in the development of the world\u2019s power grid [2\u20134].\nInvestment is the economic foundation for the development of smart grids, but due to the\ndifferent driving forces of smart grid development in different countries, the focus of investment\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4047; doi:10.3390/su10114047 www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability78\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4047\nin the construction of smart grids is also different. In 2010, the top ten countries that the central\ngovernment invested in the smart grid are shown in the Figure 1. Their total investment has reached\n$18.4 billion and will continue to grow in the future. For Europe, its development focus is on the optimal\noperation of the power grid, the optimization of power grid infrastructure, and the development of\ncommunications and information technology. For the United States, its development and construction\nfocus is on low-carbon and energy efficiency. For Japan, its construction focus is on the green economy.\nIn China, its construction focus at present is to improve the resource allocation capability, safety level,\nand operating efficiency of the power grid. The development of smart grids in China is divided into\nthree stages: pilot stage for planning, stage of comprehensive construction, and stage of guiding and\nimproving. The situation of smart grid investment in each stage is shown in Figure 2 below.\nFigure 1. Smart grid investment in top ten countries.\nFigure 2. Investment status of China at each stage.\nAfter high-speed construction in recent years, the development of smart grid at abroad has\nentered a stage of normalization. As developed countries such as Europe and the United States have\na high level in the development, construction, and operation management of power grids, a great\ndeal of research work has been carried out on the assessment of smart grids. The experience has been\naccumulated and relatively rich achievements have been achieved [5\u20137]. For China, the development\nof the smart grid has also entered a critical stage. Under the layout of the State Grid Corporation\non smart grids, provincial power grid companies have responded to the call to speed up the pace of\ndevelopment and construction. Therefore, it is urgent to establish a sound evaluation system and\nmechanism to evaluate the level of smart grid development to guide its direction of development.\nBased on this background, this paper establishes an index system that combines the effect layer and\n79\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4047\nthe base layer, evaluates the development level of the smart grid in a specific region, looks for its weak\nlinks, and gives corresponding optimization suggestions.\nThe paper is organized as follows. The second part serves as a literature review. The third part\nintroduces the establishment of the index system. The fourth part and the fifth part respectively\nintroduce the effect layer index system and the base layer index system. In the sixth part, the paper\ngives the evaluation process of the development level of the smart grid. The seventh part analyzes the\nexamples. Finally, the eighth part offers conclusion.\n2.

Construction of the Index System\nThe comprehensive evaluation model of the level of development of the smart grid aims to\nachieve systematic evaluation of the overall level of the smart grid. Therefore, this paper establishes\nan index system from the effect layer and the base layer and builds the relationship between the two\nlayers. The effect layer reflects the inherent nature of the development of smart grid and is dedicated\nto meeting the development needs of smart grid, while the base layer is the focus of smart grid\nconstruction. The index system structure of this paper shown in Figure 3.\n \nFigure 3. The structure of index system.\n4. Index System of Effect Layer\n4.1. Safety and Reliability\nThe safe and reliable operation are the key tasks for the future development of power grid.\nIt involves the power supply security and reliability of power quality [35] and the ability to enhance\nthe safety, stability and accident prevention capability of large power grids. The construction of\ncommunication information network is an important part of the intelligent construction of China\u2019s\npower grid, so the safety of communication information is equally worth noting. Therefore, the index\nsystem of the safety and reliability of the power grid is mainly established from two aspects: the safety\nand reliability of power grid and the safety of communication information, as shown in Table 2 [36].\n82\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4047\nTable 2.

Economy and Efficiency\nEconomy and efficiency is to improve the grid operation and transmission efficiency,\nreduce operating costs and promote the efficient use of energy resources and power assets, so the\nindex system of economics and efficiency of the power grid is mainly established from three aspects:\neconomic benefits, grid efficiency and staff efficiency, as shown in Table 3.\nTable 3. Index system of economics and efficiency.\nSecond-Level Indicators Third-Level Indicators Code\nEconomic benefits\nThe revenue of value-added services [39] E9\nThe recovery of electricity E10\nThe fair coefficient of electricity consumption E11\nGrid efficiency [40]\nThe annual maximum load utilization E12\nThe maximum load rate of power lines E13\nThe annual average equivalent load rate of line operation E14\nThe annual maximum load rate of main transformer E15\nThe annual average equivalent load rate of main transformer operation E16\nStaff efficiency\nThe efficiency of transmission staff E17\nThe efficiency of transformation staff E18\nThe efficiency of urban distribution network staff E19\nOverall labor productivity E20\n4.3. Clean and Green\nClean and green means to improve the energy structure, improve the level of electrification,\nrealize the large-scale development of clean energy and optimize the configuration of it in a wide\nrange, replace the fossil energy with clean energy, and make the clean energy gradually become the\ndominant energy in the future. Therefore, the index system of the clean and green of the power grid is\nmainly established from three aspects: green power generation, green power grid, and green electricity,\nas shown in Table 4.\n83\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4047\nTable 4.

Openness and Interaction\nOpenness and interaction means that based on the platform of intellectualized service which\nbuilt by smart grid to adapt to the connection and interaction of various types of power supply and\nload flexibly to meet the diverse needs of customers. Therefore, the index system of the openness and\ninteraction of the power grids mainly established from four aspects: the transparency of power grid,\nthe openness of power grid, quality service, and interactive effect, as shown in Table 5.\nTable 5.

Index System of Base Layer\nBased on the basic requirements of the construction of smart grid, this paper divides the basis of\nintelligent grid construction into three aspects: automation, interaction and information, and takes\nthem as first-level index to establish the evaluation index system of the base layer.\n5.1. Automation\nPower network automation mainly refers to the automated operation of the power system.\nBy running modern communication technology, network technology and automatic control technology,\nit reaches the automatic detection and control of grid operation, enhances the ability of online\nmonitoring and self-protection operation, and effectively improves the efficiency of grid operation,\nto ensure reliable and efficient operation of the power grid. Therefore, the index system of power\nnetwork automation is mainly established from four aspects: transmission automation, substation\nautomation, distribution automation, and dispatching automation, as shown in Table 6.\n84\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4047\nTable 6.

Interaction\nInteractive technology of the smart grid is a key technology and development direction which can\nimprove the capacity of the grid to carry new energy and ensure the power quality of the grid. It can\nachieve the multi-directional interaction among the power supply, power grid and users, and allows\nusers to participate more in the process of power balance by changing users\u2019 electricity behavior\nand developing the access of distributed energy. Therefore, the index system of interaction is mainly\nestablished from four aspects: interaction of electricity use, electric vehicles, large-scale access to new\nenergy sources, and distributed power supply, as shown in Table 7.\nTable 7.

Informatization\nGrid informatization refers to the process of cultivating and developing new productivity\nrepresented by intelligent tools such as computers and network communication technologies in\nthe power grid and improving the operation and management of the power grid. It is reflected in\nthe construction of communication network and information construction index system as shown in\nTable 8.\n85\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4047\nTable 8.

Evaluation Process of Smart Grid Development Level\n6.1. Implementation Path of Evaluation Model\nThe comprehensive evaluation model of the development level of smart grid is based on the\ntheory of system evaluation and can accurately evaluate the overall development level of smart grid.\nBy decomposing and refining the smart grid, it deepens its understanding of the smart grid,\nenhances the specificity and representativeness of the evaluation index, and improves the accuracy of\nthe evaluation results. Through the research on the coordinative relationship among the indicators,\na dynamic weight calculation method is designed to realize the two-way interaction between the effect\nlayer and base layer.\nWhen choosing the evaluation method of smart grid, this paper select the appropriate evaluation\nmethod based on the characteristics of each attribute and index, and combine with the application\nscope of the method, so as to obtain a more accurate and reasonable evaluation result. The evaluation\nmodel process of this paper as shown in Figure 4.\nFigure 4. Technical path of comprehensive evaluation model.\n86\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4047\n6.2. Method of Evaluation Model\n6.2.1. Subjective Weights of the Effect Level Indicators by the AHP Method\nThe Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a practical multi-objective decision-making method.\nWhen AHP is used to analyze the decision-making problem, first of all, we need to rationalize and\nstratify the issue so as to construct a hierarchical structural model. The basic steps are as follows:\n(1) Establish a hierarchical structure.\n(2) Construct a judgment matrix.\nHierarchies reflect the relationship between the factors, but the criteria of the criterion layer do\nnot necessarily share the same weight in the target measure. This article uses the numbers 1\u20139 and\ntheir reciprocal as a scale. Table 9 lists the meaning of 1\u20139 scale:\nTable 9. The judgment basis of scale value and related description.\nScale Value Description\n1 Indicates that elements i and j are of equal importance\n3 Representing the elements i and j, the former is slightly more important than the latter\n5 Representing the elements i and j, the former is significantly more important than the latter\n7 Representing the elements i and j, the former is awfully more important than the latter\n9 Representing the elements i and j, the former is perfectly more important than the latter\n2, 4, 6, 8 The importance is between the above two\nReciprocal Representing the importance of elements i and j in contrast to the above\n(3) Hierarchical single arrangement and consistency checking\nHierarchical single arrangement is based on the judgment matrix, calculating the target element\nin the previous level, and determining the importance (weight) of level and its associated elements.\nThe method of solving the largest eigenvector of the judgment matrix is used to obtain the weight of\nsingle arrangement. The formula is:\nCW = \u03bbmaxW (1)\nwhere \u03bbmax and W denote the maximum eigenvalue of the judgment matrix C and the\ncorresponding eigenvector.\nIn order to avoid the contradictory judgment result in the process of expert judgment, it is\nnecessary to check consistency of hierarchical single arrangement. Check the consistency of the\njudgment matrix by calculating the CR value:\nCR = CI/RI (2)\nCI = (\u03bbmax \u2212 n)/(n \u2212 1) is the dimension of the judgment matrix, RI is the corresponding\nrandom value, as shown in Table 10.\nTable 10. RI value that correspond to n.\nN 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nRI 0 0 0.58 0.9 1.12 1.24 1.32 1.41 1.45\nIf CR < 0.1, then the judgment matrix can be regarded as satisfactory consistency. The judgment\nmatrix can be used as a hierarchical analysis. If CR \u2265 0.1, the judgment matrix is not satisfactory,\nand the judgment matrix needs to be adjusted and corrected.\n(4) Hierarchical total ordering and consistency checking\n87\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4047\nThrough the above steps, a set of weight vectors can be obtained. Ultimately, we should obtain\nthe weight of sorting the goals in each element, especially in the lowest level, so as to make a choice\nof solutions. The total sequencing weight will synthesize the weights of the single criteria from top\nto bottom.\nSuppose that the upper level (level A) contains m factors A1, . . . , Am, and the total weight of\ntheir levels is a1, . . . , am. The next level (B level) contains n factors B1, . . . , Bn, whose rank ordering\nweights for Aj are respectively b1j, . . . , bnj (bij = 0 when Bi is unassociated with Aj). We now ask for the\nweight of each factor in the B-layer about the total goal, that is, find the total weight b1, . . . , bn of the\nhierarchy of each factor in the B-tier. The calculation is performed in the following way:\nbi =\nm\n\u2211\nj=1\nbijaj, i = 1, . . . , n (3)\nThe hierarchical total ordering also needs to be checked for consistency. The test is still performed\nfrom the high level to the low level layer by layer like the total level of the hierarchy. The pairwise\ncomparison judgment matrix of factors related to Aj in layer B is checked for consistency in a\nsingle ranking, and the single-order consistency index is obtained as CI(j), (j = 1, . . . ,m), and the\ncorresponding average When the random consistency index is RI(j) (CI(j) and RI(j) have been obtained\nwhen the levels are single-ordered), the proportion of random coherence of the total order of the\nB-level is:\nCR =\nm\n\u2211\nj=1\nCI(j)aj\nm\n\u2211\nj=1\nRI(j)aj\n(4)\nwhen CR < 0.10, it is considered that the hierarchical total ordering results have a satisfactory\nconsistency and accept the analysis result.\n6.2.2. Correcting the Weight of the Effect Layer in the Direction of Development Demand\nBased on the basic cluster analysis of the development of the provincial power grids in the\ncountry, the provincial power grids can be divided into three categories. Provincial power grids A, B,\nand C are selected from each of them, their development demand index values separately calculated,\nthe development demand index values of the provinces where they are located as the target value\naveraged, and the demand pressure index calculated separately. The first-level indicators at the effect\nlevel are revised to meet the demand-oriented goal. The specific process is as follows in Figure 5.\nFigure 5. Process of weight modification.\n(1) The measurement index of smart grid development demand\nBased on the availability of the current indicator data, the measurement indicators of smart grid\ndevelopment demand are shown in Table 11.\n88\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4047\nTable 11. The measurement indicators of smart grid development demand.\nDimensions of Demand Quantitative Measurement Indicators\nCode of Demand\nPressure Indicators\nSafety and reliability (D1)\nThe proportion of a type of load DC1\nThe proportion of secondary industry production GDP DC2\nLoad density DC3\nCapacity-load ratio DC4\nUrbanization rate DC5\nEconomy and efficiency (D2)\nReturn on assets DC6\nOverall labor productivity DC7\nElectricity sale of unit assets DC8\nEnergy intensity DC9\nRatio of power generation and electricity DC10\nClean and green (D3)\nThe proportion of clean energy production DC11\nAir-quality index DC12\nCarbon dioxide emissions per unit area DC13\nCarbon intensity DC14\nThe proportion of electrical energy in terminal energy\nconsumption DC15\nOpenness and interaction (D4)\nReasonable degree of utilization hours of power\ngeneration equipment DC16\nRatio of urban-rural power supply reliability DC17\nQuality service evaluation index DC18\nPer capita electricity consumption DC19\nThe proportion of tertiary industry production GDP DC20\nThe demand pressure index formula is shown in Equation (5).\ndemand pressure index =\nMax(actual value, target value)\nMin(actual value, target value)\n(5)\nDemand pressure index of safety and reliability (D1)\n=DC1 + DC2 + DC3 + DC4 + DC5\nDemand pressure index of economy and efficiency (D2)\n=DC6 + DC7 + DC8 + DC9 + DC10\nDemand pressure index of clean and green (D3)\n=DC11 + DC12 + DC13 + DC14 + DC15\nDemand pressure index of openness and interaction (D4)\n=DC16 + DC17 + DC18 + DC19 + DC20\n(2) After the normalization process as the requirement four-dimensional weight value\nThe above calculation results and the AHP method are used to correct the weight of the first-level\nindicators of the effect layer. The two mean values are taken as the final weight of the indicator, and the\nsecond-level and third-level indicators\u2019 weights of the effect layer are corrected in order.\n6.2.3. Determination of Objective Weights of Base Layer Indicators\nIn this paper, the Entropy Method [43] is used to calculate the objective weights of the base layer\nindicators. It is a method to determine the weights based on the amount of information provided by\nthe observations of each index. It is an objective method of empowerment that embodies the size of\nthe evaluation of indicators in objective information. The basic implementation steps are as follows:\n(1) Evaluation index membership degree matrix standardization\nThe n object to be evaluated corresponds to the index values of the m evaluation indices and\nconstitutes a membership evaluation standard R.\n89\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4047\nR =\n\u239b\n\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d\nr11 r12 . . . r1m\nr21 r22 . . . r2m\n. . . . . .\nrn1 rn2 . . . rnm\n\u239e\n\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0\nIn this evaluation index system, there are differences in the dimension, content, merits and\ndemerits of each indicator, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to standardize the value of each indicator.\nThere are two kinds of standardized processing methods: The larger the indicator data is, the better,\nthat is, the positive indicator. The standard formula is:\nrij =\nxij \u2212 minxij\nmaxxij \u2212 minxij (6)\nwhen the indicator data is smaller, the better, that is, the inverse indicator, the standard formula is:\nrij =\nmaxxij \u2212 xij\nmaxxij \u2212 minxij (7)\n(2) Normalize each indicator value and calculate the proportion of the indicator value of the ith\nevaluation object under the jth indicator:\nPij =\nrij\nn\n\u2211\nj=1\nrij\n(8)\n(3) Calculate the entropy of the jth indicator:\nHj = \u2212K\nn\n\u2211\ni=1\nPij ln Pij(j = 1, 2, . . . , m) (9)\nAmong them:\nK = 1/ ln n(K>0, 0 \u2264 Pij \u2264 1) (10)\nand assume that:\nPij = 0, Pij ln Pij = 0 (11)\n(4) Calculate the difference coefficient of the jth indicator:\n\u03b1j = 1 \u2212 Hj (12)\n(5) Calculate the weight of the jth indicator:\nwj =\n\u03b1j\nm\n\u2211\nj=1\n\u03b1j\n(13)\n6.2.4. Relationship among the Effect Layer and the Base Layer Indicators\nUntil now, the smart grid construction period is not long, and there are few index data,\nthe correlation analysis based on the index data may have errors. Therefore, this paper first uses the\nexpert scoring method to judge the correlation degree between two-level indicators of effect layer and\nthe key indicators of the basic layer. The specific process is as follows in Figure 6.\n90\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4047\nFigure 6. Process of correlation analysis.\nThe association table between effect layer and base layer indicators is showed in Table 12.\nTable 12.

Case Study\nUsing the above-mentioned index system and evaluation method, three provincial power grids\nare selected, and scores are assigned to each aspect of smart grid development in combination with\nthe weights and index values, thereby assessing the development level of smart grids. The results are\nas follows.\n91\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4047\n7.1. Province A\nThe relevant data (for example, the reliability of power supply, overall labor productivity,\nthe proportion of renewable energy power generation, the evaluation index of quality service) that can\nreflect the first-level indicators of the effect layer in A province is used as a reference. Ten experts are\nhired to score the importance level of the first-level indicators in the effect layer, and the weights of the\nfirst-level indicators are calculated by the judgment matrix given by the experts. Finally, the weight\nresult obtained by the AHP method is the average value of the calculation results of the ten expert\njudgment matrix, and then the weight is corrected by the indices of development demand to obtain\nthe final weight of the first-level index, and so on, and the weights of the indicators at all levels\nare calculated.\nThe weights calculated using the judgment matrix given by one of the experts is showed in\nTable 13, and has passed the consistency test.\nTable 13.

The weight of the first-level index of the\nbase layer is calculated by the entropy weight method. The final result is shown in Table 14.\nTable 14.

The results are shown in\nTable 16.\n92\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4047\nTable 16.

In terms of clean and green,\nthe province is committed to improving the efficiency of thermal power energy use and promoting\nenergy conservation and emission reduction, therefore, the level of it has been improved to some\nextent. On the whole, the development level of smart grid effect level of province A should be fully\npromoted through the two main lines of technological progress and management improvement.\n(2) Evaluation results of base level\n93\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4047\nProvince A\u2019s evaluation results of base level are showed in Figures 9 and 10.\n40.00\n45.00\n50.00\n55.00\n60.00\n65.00\n70.00\n75.00\n80.00\n2 0 1 1 2 0 1 2 2 0 1 3 2 0 1 4 2 0 1 5\nSC\nO\nRE\nYEAR\nAutomation Interaction Informatization\nFigure 9.

Evaluation results of base level of Province A.\nThe level of automation, interaction, and informatization of the smart grid in the province has\nbeen gradually improved, so the overall level of its base layer is on the rise. The provincial power\ncompany\u2019s smart grid construction plan was completed in 2010 and entered the full-scale construction\nphase of the smart grid in 2011. During the \u201cTwelfth Five-Year Plan\u201d period, the provincial electric\npower company increased its investment in the construction of a smart grid, and extensively adopted\nmodern technology and automation equipment. As a result, the level of the base level of power grid\nhas been comprehensively improved.\n7.2.

Evaluation results of effect level of Province B.\nAs can be seen from the radar map, the radar area is increasing year by year, and the improvement\nof the intelligent effect tends to be flat. Among them, the progress of safety and reliability is\nrelatively fast, indicating that the Province B\u2019s smart grid construction has a good effect on the\nconstruction of power grids and power supplies. In terms of economy and interaction, it may not\nperform well because related projects are mostly piloted or promoted. From the above figure, it can\nalso be seen that the level of the power grid effect of the province is slowly growing, and the growth\nrate is fluctuating.\nIn the aspect of safety and reliability, it is indicated that the construction of the power grid is\nunder the background of UHV AC and DC landing in the Central Plains, and priority is given to\nensuring a wide range of optimal allocation of energy resources. In terms of cleanness and green\n95\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4047\nand openness and interaction, the company is a power grid based on thermal power, and marketing\nand interactive services are starting. In terms of economic and efficiency, due to the large number of\nhistorical problems in the grid, the overall weak distribution network and low operating efficiency\nhave not yet been fundamentally reversed.\n7.2.2.

Evaluation results of base level of Province C.\nFrom the above figure, we can see that the level of automation, interaction and informatization of\nthe smart grid in the province has been increasing year by year, but the growth rate is different.\nIn terms of automation and informatization, the growth rate accelerated in 2013. This is because\nin 2013, the provincial power grid company carried out all-round power grid geographic information\nsystem collection work. As of June 2015, with the province\u2019s total 35 kV, 110 The GIS data collection\nwork of the KV transmission line was fully completed. The power company of the province realized\nvisualization, space, and automation management of the power grid through the power grid GIS\n\u201cbig data\u201d, thus greatly improving the automation and informatization level of the entire power grid.\nAs for interaction, its growth rate has been relatively stable.\n98\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4047\n7.4.

Comprehensive evaluation results.\nAs can be seen from above figures, in the early stage of smart grid construction in 2011,\nalthough the scores of the base layer were low, the construction achievements were remarkable,\nand the scores in the effect layer were relatively high. With the promotion and construction of the\nsmart grid, although the levels of intelligence of the grid infrastructure keep growing at a certain\nrate, the speed of the improvement of the effect layer has decreased year by year and tends to be flat;\nby 2014\u20132015, although the score of the base layer continues to increase, the score of the effect layer\nhas grown little, which fully reflects the development rule that the smart grid has been in an all-round\nconstruction phase.\nThe final comprehensive evaluation results show that Province A is better than Province B in the\noverall level of smart grid development, and Province B is better than Province C. Therefore, the power\ncompanies in Province B and Province C need to further strengthen the construction and operation\nmanagement of the smart grid.\n99\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4047\n8. Conclusions\nBased on the difference of demand for the development of smart grid, this paper first establishes\nits own index system. Subsequently, this paper proposes the implementation path of the evaluation\nmodel. Finally, three typical provinces were selected to evaluate and compare the level of smart\ngrid development.\nWe know that as the smart grid is written into the \u201cTwelfth Five-Year Plan\u201d, its status in the\ncountry\u2019s strategic emerging industries gradually emerged, and the nation\u2019s smart grid construction\nwas fully launched. The year 2011 is the first year for the smart grid to enter the comprehensive\nconstruction phase. It is also the starting point for the smart grid to achieve leapfrogging from\npilot construction to comprehensive construction. By 2015, a strong smart grid operation control\nand two-way interactive service system has been formed to basically achieve friendly access and\ncoordinated control of renewable energy such as wind power and solar power generation.\nBased on this background, this paper proposes to evaluate the development level of smart grid\nusing weight modification, transmission mechanisms, and evaluation methods combining subjective\nand objective weights, and selects three typical provinces for case demonstration.\nFor Province A, its development goal in the Twelfth Five-Year Plan is to build a strong, self-reliant,\neconomical, compatible, flexible, and integrated urban power grid that matches the orientation of\nurban development and is characterized by information, automation, and interaction. Therefore,\nthe government has increased investment, promoted energy-saving construction, and adopted modern\ntechnology and automation equipment. As a result, the level of the effect layer and base layer of\nsmart grid is relatively high, and its overall level is also relatively high compared to other provinces.\nFor provinces B and C, due to historical issues and different stages of development, the overall level of\nsmart grid development is relatively low compared to province A.\nThrough the analysis of relevant examples, it can be proved that the evaluation model can make\nan association analysis between the construction foundation and the construction effect, and make a\ncomprehensive and deep evaluation of the development level of the smart grid in our country, which is\nof guiding significance to the future intelligent construction of the power grid.\nWhen using this evaluation method to calculate the weight, the general indicators such as the\nnumber of transmission and transformation accidents, overall labor productivity, the proportion of\nrenewable energy power generation, the rate of electricity market transaction power growth, the ratio\nof intelligent substation, the coverage of smart electric meter, and so on, can be directly applied to\ndifferent regions and countries, but it should be noted that because different metrics are used around\nthe world, such as assessing the reliability of power systems, there are different indicators, such as\nSAIDI/SAIFI, and the indicators proposed in this paper are not all versatile, therefore, when applying\nthis method, some substitutions can be made appropriately without affecting the content embodied in\nthe indicator.\nAuthor Contributions: J.L. contributed to the conception and design.

Additionally, unbalance is further increased with high\npenetration of single-phased distributed generators. Load and optimal power flows, when applied to\ndistribution networks, use models developed for transmission grids with limited modification. The\nperformance of optimal power flow depends on external factors such as ambient temperature and\nirradiation, since they have strong influence on loads and distributed energy resources such as photo\nvoltaic systems. To help mitigate the issues mentioned above, the authors present a novel class of\noptimal power flow algorithm which is applied to low-voltage distribution networks. It involves the\nuse of a novel three-phase unbalanced holomorphic embedding load flow method in conjunction\nwith a non-convex optimization method to obtain the optimal set-points based on a suitable objective\nfunction. This novel three-phase load flow method is benchmarked against the well-known power\nfactory Newton-Raphson algorithm for various test networks. Mann-Whitney U test is performed\nfor the voltage magnitude data generated by both methods and null hypothesis is accepted. A use\ncase involving a real network in Austria and a method to generate optimal schedules for various\ncontrollable buses is provided.\nKeywords: unbalanced three-phase distribution networks; optimal power flows; genetic algorithm;\nholomorphic embedding load flow method; simulation\n1. Introduction\nIn recent years, with the integration of distributed generators, electric storage, electrical vehicles,\nand demand response units, the role of distribution systems is changing. Distributed energy units\n(DERs) are posing problems mainly in the low-voltage networks with their intermittency and\nuncontrollability. New innovative solutions are required to maintain grid security. Management\nof low-voltage distribution networks are challenging since they contain large array of devices which\nneed to be controlled, and monitoring systems are limited. The above DERs along with loads should\nbe run in a sustainable fashion since it is one of the biggest challenges. Various methods to control the\nDERs are presented in [1].\nA so-called advanced distribution management system (ADMS) has come into existence, evolving\nfrom the transmission network\u2019s supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA). This is\npossible with the increase in smart meters and monitoring devices in the network which provides data\nacquisition abilities [2]. ADMS provides functionalities such as load flow analysis, optimal power flow,\nmonitoring and control capabilities similar to SCADA systems [3]. This must in theory, host advance\nfunctionalities such as adaptive protection leading to self-healing, real-time monitoring, dynamic\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1774; doi:10.3390/su11061774 www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability103\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1774\nnetwork reconfiguration and control [4\u20138]. This will provide intelligence to the grid with topology\nprocessor, state estimation, load and generation modeling [3]. The grid needs to be operated optimally\nand the power flows should be optimal to reduce losses, increase security, and maximize economic\nbenefit. Energy balance should be maintained for secure operation of the network to maintain the\nfrequency and voltage within its limits.\nOptimal Power Flow (OPF) is one of the most fundamental functionalities of ADMS. In the\nliterature, various OPF algorithms can be found. The authors in [9] describe an OPF algorithm to\ncontrol active, reactive power, and transformer taps. The objective is to minimize system costs and\nlosses. This method is based on Newton-Raphson load flow. Feasible power flow is solved, and\nthe optimum is close to the load flow solution. Therefore, Jacobian information is used to calculate\nthe optimum in a linear fashion. In [10], a non-linear programming technique is used to provide\nsolution to OPF problem the objectives being economic dispatch and generation cost minimization.\nSame as before, load flow is performed to determine a feasible solution. Fletcher-Powell method\nis used to minimize the objective function. A general economic dispatch problem is implemented\nin [11]. This approach is similar to that in [9,10]. In [12], an OPF method for power system planning is\nprovided. It used generalized reduced gradient technique to find the optimum. Hessian Matrix-based\nOPF method is illustrated in [13]. It combines non-linear programming, Newton-based methods and\nuses Hessian matrix load flow to minimize the quadratic objective. In [14], an OPF algorithm using\nNewton\u2019s method with Hessian in place of Jacobian matrix and Lagrangian multipliers is provided.\nIt provides good convergence when compared to its predecessors. An OPF problem which includes\nsteady-state security is presented in [15]. It is an extension of [9] which includes exact constraints on\noutage contingencies. In [16], a solution to the optimal dispatch problem using Jacobian matrix is\nimplemented. It provides rapid convergence which can be used in online control. An OPF algorithm\nbased on reduced gradient method is proposed in [17]. It is used to minimize generator loading and\noptimize voltage levels. Load flow equations are represented as equality constraints. The authors\nin [18] have described an OPF method using reduced Hessian matrix with systematic constraint\nhandling. It provides accurate solution, good convergence, and description about acceleration factor is\nprovided. In [19], modified recursive quadratic programming (MRQP)-based OPF is implemented.\nMRQP is based on [11]. An algorithm to solve large OPF problem is presented in [20]. It decomposes\nthe original large problem into set of subproblems which are constrained linearly using augmented\nLagrangian.\nIn 1991, a landmark paper [21] classified various OPF techniques into two categories. Class A\ndescribes a series of algorithms which uses ordinary load flow to get an intermediate solution and\nthis solution is under normal circumstances is close to the optimal load flow solutions. Using Jacobian\nmatrix and various other sensitivity relations, optimization is performed iteratively. At each iteration,\nnew load flow is performed. The optimal solution of this class strongly depends on the accuracy of\nload flow solution. With a load flow solution, set of voltages, and phase angles, Jacobian matrix and\nset of incremental power flow equations are available or can be extended. If a load flow solution exists,\nit already satisfies all the constraints. The optimization problem is solved separately by incorporating\nthe sensitivity relation from before to arrive at an optimal one. In [9] an implementation of Class A\nalgorithm is provided. Another example of such implementation is provided in parts one and two\nin [22] and [23] respectively using linear programming.\nClass B refers to the class of algorithms which depend on exact optimal conditions and therefore\nuse load flow equations as equality constraints. The optimal solution is dependent on detailed\nformulation of the OPF problem with the entire search space. This does not need a load flow\nsolution. However, these kinds of problems are non-convex in nature. Therefore, convex relaxation\nor non-convex solvers are needed to compute the optimum which poses its own difficulties. It deals\nwith the optimality conditions from Lagrangian function and comprises of derivatives of constraints\nand objective functions. Since the Hessian matrix is sparse and remains constant, it further increases\nthe simplicity of this method and ease at which the optimum is achieved. Constraint handling is\n104\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1774\none of the biggest challenges of this class of algorithms. Using a heuristic method, constraints are\nhandled as penalty terms which requires refactoring at every step and therefore, leads to degradation\nof the performance.\nThe above two classes of algorithms has various advantages and disadvantages. Performance\nof Class A directly depends in the performance of load flow techniques such as Newton-Raphson,\nGauss-Seidel and widely used Fast Decoupled Method. It is shown in [24] that the above-mentioned\nmethods have convergence and robustness issues. This may result in inaccurate load flow solutions. If\nthe load flow does not result in a so-called high voltage or operable solution, Class A algorithms fails.\nIn Class B algorithms, getting a global operable solution is challenging since it needs convex relaxation\nor heuristic techniques and the operable solution is difficult to achieve by respecting all the constraints.\nThe authors in this paper present a third class of algorithms, a Class C. This class combines Class\nA and Class B. It uses a reliable load flow described in Section 2 method wrapped around a heuristic\nto determine the optimal solution. The load flow provides accurate operable voltage and phase angle\nsolution at every step and the heuristic uses this as equality constraints as described in Class B. Class C\nalgorithms present various advantages. Operable voltage and phase angle solution is obtained at each\niteration with the help of THELM. THELM always finds a solution, if it exists, irrespective of initial\nconditions whereas, Newton-Raphson load flow method leads to a non-convergent solution at very\nlow or high loading conditions [24]. Since THELM is used in Class C method, the results are high\nvoltage and operable. Global OPF solution can be obtained with a non-convex solver.\nThe following contributions and structure of the paper is as follows,\n1. Load Flow Solution to three-phase unbalanced distribution network using Holomorphic\nEmbedding Load Flow Method (HELM) is described in Section 2.\n2. Benchmarking of HELM against established Newton-Raphson load flow solver from DIgSILENT\nPowerFactory [25] which is a well-known power system simulation and analysis software. This\nis discussed in Section 2.\n3. OPF using Distributed Genetic Algorithm, a Class C algorithm is described in detail in Section 3\n4. Simulation of OPF is performed to generate active and reactive power schedules at controllable\nnodes (see Section 5). This algorithm is applied to a real network in Austria.\n2. Three-Phase Unbalanced Load Flow Method\nA solution to the load flow problem is mostly obtained using numerical iterative methods such\nas Gauss-Seidel with its slow convergence and improved Newton-Raphson method, which provides\nbetter convergence [26,27]. Newton-Raphson method is computationally expensive since it must\ncalculate Jacobean matrix at each iteration step in-spite of using sparse matrix techniques [28]. Various\ndecoupled methods have been implemented which exploits the weak link between active power\nand voltage, in which Jacobian matrix needs to be calculated only once. One such method is Fast\nDecoupled Load Flow method which is widely used in the community [29]. The above-mentioned\niterative techniques face similar problems with no guaranteed convergence since it depends on the\ninitial conditions. This is due to the fact that load flow equations are non-convex in nature with multiple\nsolutions. It is difficult to control the way these iterative methods converge to an operable solution [24].\nIn the literature, multiple implementations to improve the convergence of such traditional algorithm\nhave been illustrated with limited success [30\u201336].\nTo use load flow methods in near or real-time applications, the physical models should fully\ndeterministic and solved with reliability. HELM is one such candidate which can full fill these\nrequirements [24].\n105\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1774\nThree-Phase Holomorphic Embedding Load Flow Method\nPower flow equations, for example, the load bus equation described in Equation (1) is inherently\nnon-analytical.

Equation (5) is referred to as reflecting condition.\nSince voltages of from Equation (2) for \u03b1 = 0 as discussed above, it can be extended to power\nseries described in Equation (6) and (7) at \u03b1 = 0.\nVi(\u03b1) =\n\u221e\n\u2211\nn=0\nVi[n]\u03b1n, i \u2208 \u03a9 (6)\n1\nVi(\u03b1)\n= Wi(\u03b1) =\n\u221e\n\u2211\nn=0\nWi[n]\u03b1n, i \u2208 \u03a9 (7)\nEquation (9) is obtained by substituting 7 into 2 and power series coefficients can be calculated to\na desired degree.\n\u2211\nk\u2208\u03a9\nY\u2217ik\ninf\n\u2211\nn=0\nVk[n](\u03b1n) = \u03b1S\u2217i W\n\u2217\ni [n]\u03b1\nn (8)\nThe following steps are involved to calculate voltages.\n1.

Pade approximations which are particular kind of rational approximations are used for analytical\ncontinuum to determine the voltages at \u03b1 = 1.\nBased on the fundamentals of HELM discussed above, various research work dealing with\nenhancing or improving the method is available. One of the major deficiencies of the HELM described\nin [24] is that the PV/Generator bus is not defined. A PV bus model was presented in [37]. Ref. [38]\npresents an improved PV bus model and the major contribution of this paper is to provide alternative\nmodels capable of solving general networks. The authors have provided four methods with various\nparameters for PV bus. In the literature, three-phase formulation of HELM is lacking. In this paper,\nmethod four developed in [38] is extended to a novel three-phase unbalanced formulation which can\nbe seen below. Equation (13) represents a general form of three-phase unbalanced HELM. Network\nmodels including various device models such as loads, generators, transformers are derived from the\nmodels developed in [39]. The seed solution, non-singularity of matrix A in Equation (14) and the\nreflective conditions of holomorphic functions are taken, as is, from [38].

Optimal Power Flow Model\nAs described in Section 1, OPF algorithms can be classified under three classes. There have been a\nlot of research on OPF and this can be seen in the vast array of work available in the literature.\nType C algorithms requires non-convex solvers to perform optimization problems. Non-convex\nsolvers have been previously used to solve OPF problems but, they are used in the context of Class B\nalgorithms. The authors in [40] have provided a method to plan reactive power flows optimally using\ngeneric algorithm as it provides optimum which is a global one. The proposed method is applied\nto two 51 and 224 bus networks. An OPF problem is solved using generic algorithm in [41] as a\nunified power flow controller to regulate branch voltages with respect to both angle and magnitude.\nIt minimizes real power losses and security limits of power flows are maintained. Reactive power\nplanning using hybrid genetic algorithm is presented in [42]. It uses genetic algorithm at the highest\nlevel and linear programming to get the optimum sequentially. This can be considered as a modified\nversion of Class A. It uses genetic algorithm instead of just load flow to determine the initial converged\nsolution to the OPF problem.\nIn [43], a feeder reconfiguration technique is presented. It uses genetic algorithm in the context of\nOPF to reduce losses in a distribution system. Switches are opened to determine the initial population.\nThe authors in [44], have presented a hybrid evolutionary algorithm with multi-objective OPF. It is\nused to minimize losses, voltage, and power flow deviations and generator costs. In [45], optimal\nplacement and sizing of capacitor banks in distributed networks using genetic algorithm is presented.\nThe objective is to simultaneously improve the power quality and sizing of fixed capacitor banks.\nIn this paper, the OPF problem is formulated as follows,\nminimize\nx\nF(x, u)\nsubject to u \u2208 U\nG(x, u) = 0,\nH(x, u) \u2264 0\n(17)\nwhere,\nx and u represent sets of state and input variables.\nF(x, u) is the objective function for the OPF problem. Typical objectives are total generator cost,\nloss minimization in network and in this paper, the objective function chosen is the three-phase\nunbalance minimization (see Section 4).\nG(x, u) and H(x, u) represents the equality and inequality constraints of the OPF problem.\n108\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1774\nIn the context of type C algorithms, accurate and reliable load flow is used as equality constraints.\nIn this case, THELM is used.\nTypical inequality constraints for a three-phase unbalanced distribution grids are enlisted below,\nLimits on active power (kW) of a (generator) PV node: PLowi \u2264 PPVi \u2264 PHighi\nLimits on voltage (V (pu.)) of a PV or PQ node: |VLowi | \u2264 |Vi| \u2264 |VHighi |\nLimits on tap positions of a transformer: tLowi \u2264 ti \u2264 tHighi\nLimits on phase shift angles of a transformer: \u03b8Lowi \u2264 \u03b8i \u2264 \u03b8Highi\nLimits on shunt capacitances or reactances: sLowi \u2264 si \u2264 sHighi\nLimits on reactive power (kVAr) generation of a PV node: QLowi \u2264 QPVi \u2264 QHighi\nUpper limits on active power flow in transmission lines or transformers: Pi,j \u2264 PHighi,j\nUpper limits on MVA flows in lines or transformers: P2i,j + Q\n2\ni,j \u2264 S2Highi,j\nUpper limits on current magnitudes in lines or transformers: |Ii,j| \u2264 |IHighi,j |\nLimits on voltage angles between nodes: \u0398Lowi \u2264 \u0398i \u2212 \u0398j \u2264 \u0398Highi\nIn this paper, the non-convex solver used is a genetic algorithm, to minimize the objective function.\nGenetic algorithm is chosen due to its wide use in OPF techniques, ease of parallelizability to handle\nlarge networks and its probabilistic transition rule. The authors have used the method developed\nin [46]. Genetic algorithms of the kind, mixed integer non-linear non-convex is used to include all\nthe constraints mentioned above. To accommodate THELM in genetic algorithm, it is included in the\nfitness function and penalty functions are used to include constraints.\n4. Three-Phase Unbalance Minimization\nAs mentioned in Section 1, it is essential to manage the distribution network optimally and in\na balanced fashion. Various methods have been presented in the literature to minimize three-phase\nunbalance. In [47], a method to minimize three-phase unbalance is presented. Reactive power\ncompensation is performed using flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) devices to minimize the\nthree-phase unbalance. It is applied to a simple study case of four bus system. This method does not\nprovide optimal scheduling of loads and does not include all the buses in the network. It is applicable\nonly to local grid where the FACTS devices are located. The authors in [48] have provided a method\nto minimizing network unbalance using phase swapping. A genetic and greedy algorithm is used\nto optimally swap the phases to generate a convenient solution, leading to a minimum number of\nswaps to minimize network unbalance. In [49], plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are used to minimize\nlocal three-phase unbalance. It does not include a grid perspective and is done only on the point of\ncommon coupling.\nIn this paper, OPF from Section 3 is applied to a real network in Austria. Figure 1 represents a real\nlow-voltage distribution network. In this use case, the objective function is to minimize three-phase\nvoltage unbalance which can be seen in Equation (18). This objective can be realized in multiple ways\nand in this paper, reference balanced voltages are used.\nminimize J = \u2211\nk\u2208\u03a9\n\u2211\np\u2208P\n(real(Vpk,balanced)\u2212 real(V\np\nk ))\n2 + (imag(Vpk,balanced)\u2212 imag(V\np\nk ))\n2 (18)\nwhere, P \u2208 phases(a, b, c) and B represented all the buses in the network. The voltages are represented\nin rectangular coordinate system with real part of voltage being the magnitude and imaginary part\nbeing the phase angle. Both real and imaginary value are considered because both phase and angle of\nvoltages need to be balanced.\n109\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1774\nFigure 1. Topology of a real network in Austria with controllable loads at Bus 07, Bus 15, Bus 18,\nBus 22. It represents a three-phase unbalance low-voltage distribution network with bus voltages rated\nat 0.4 kV.\nThe controllable variables are per phase active (P) and reactive powers (Q) at buses 07, 15, 18, and\n22. The single-phase loads are replaced with three-phase loads (see Figure 2).\nUncontrollable\nsinge phase load\nControllable three\nphase load\nControllable single\nphase load\nFigure 2. Single-phase loads are replaced by three-phase ones which can take both positive and\nnegative values.\nFor simplicity of representation, these three-phase loads are represented as single-phase loads\nwith red coloring. This can be observed in Figure 1. P and Q on individual loads can be modulated by\nthe OPF algorithm and can take values which are both positive and negative essentially, acting as a\nprosumer node.\n5. Simulation Results\nThis section provides simulation results to the concepts presented in the previous sections.\nIn Section 5.1, THELM described in Section 2 is validated against DIgSILENT PowerFactory\nNewton-Raphson algorithm. In Section 5.2, simulation results for three-phase unbalanced optimal\npower is presented with the three-phase unbalance minimization objective presented in Section 4.\n110\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1774\n5.1. Validation of THELM\nTHELM is benchmarked against load flow solver in an established power system analysis tool,\nDIgSILENT PowerFactory. Various simple networks are drawn with increased level of complexity\n(see Appendix A).\nVoltages from 1000 random load flows by varying active and reactive power at load buses from\n\u00b110 kW and \u00b10.8 kVAr (which accounts for power factor 0.9) are generated and tabulated below.\nMann-Whitney U test is used to compare the sample means of voltage magnitudes from the two\nmethods, since the samples are non-parametric in nature. It checks whether to accept or reject the\nnull hypothesis. Mann-Whitney U test is similar to student\u2019s T test but is suitable for non-parametric\nsamples. A sample of 100 voltages from both THELM and Power Factory NR methods are used.\nVarious statistical information and test results are tabulated in Table 1. Columns mean, standard\ndeviation, min, 25%, 50%, 75%, max are calculated by taking the absolute difference between their\nrespective voltages. All the data above is calculated by taking the average between various buses and\nphases. From the column statistic and p-value, it can be observed that their means are statistically\ninsignificant, and the null hypothesis is accepted. The results from the test suggests that THELM\nproduces results which are acceptable for load flow analysis with lower deviations from one another.\nTable 1.

Simulation Results for Three-Phase Unbalanced Optimal Power Flow\nSimulation is performed for the real grid detailed in Figure 1 using OPF algorithm described in\nSection 3. It is performed for one day from 2018-8-31 00:00:00 to 2018-9-01 00:00:00 with the sampling\ntime of 15min (96 intervals). Load profiles are from smart-meter data, from real households and are\nacquired from all the buses in the network updating a database. Forecasted profiles are inputs to the\nOPF algorithm and optimal schedules are generated based on it. Load forecasting is performed for this\ntime horizon using convolutional neural networks, using data until 2018-8-30 23:45:00. It is performed\nfor one day (day ahead forecast) and more details able it is not provided since it is out of scope.\nLoad flow solution is non-causal in nature and to generate an optimal schedule for controllable\nbuses, it must be run for all 96 intervals. OPF is performed using Class C algorithm presented in\nSection 3 for controllable buses described in Section 4. It can also be observed that the optimal schedules\nare generated for all the three phases and can take both positive and negative values. Real profile is\nrecorded during day for uncontrollable loads at the buses.\nForecasted, optimal and real active and reactive power consumption profiles at one of the\ncontrollable buses (Bus 15) can be seen in Figures 3 and 4 respectively. At Bus 15, all the loads\nare single phased (connected to phase C).\n111\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1774\nFigure 3. Active power of real, forecasted, and optimal profiles at Bus 15. It can be observed that the\nreal and forecasted data is zero for phases A and B. This is for to the fact that the loads are single phased\nand connected only to phase C. During the OPF, they are replaced with three-phase controllable loads.\nOn the x-axis, data time format is MM-dd HH. Data is from 2018-8-31 00:00:00 to 2018-9-01 00:00:00.\nFigure 4. Reactive Power of real, forecasted, and optimal schedules at Bus 15. On the x-axis, data time\nformat is MM-dd HH. Data is from 2018-8-31 00:00:00 to 2018-9-01 00:00:00.\nActive and reactive power for all the phases can be observed in Figures 3 and 4.\nUsing the three schedules shown in Figures 3 and 4, load flows are performed using THELM\ndescribed in Section 2. Loads flows are performed for all intervals and are represented using box-plots.\nFigure 5 describes the averaged objective function values based on Equation (18). It can be\nobserved that the three-phase unbalance has been reduced from 0.879 for real and forecasted profiles\n112\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1774\nto 0.529 for optimal profiles which accounts for 39% unbalance minimization based on the defined\nobjective function (see Section 4).\nFigure 5. Average values of optimal power flow objective for real, forecasted, optimal voltage and\nphase angles based on Equation (18).\nFrom Figure 6, it can be observed that the voltages are indeed balanced, and the average values\nare close to balanced voltages. Additionally, the nature of the objective function used has also caused\nthe voltages to cluster around 1 pu. since the balanced real part of the balanced voltage is exactly 1 pu.\nFigure 6. Voltage profiles generated from real, forecasted and optimal schedules from Figures 3 and 4.\n113\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1774\n6. Conclusions and Outlook\nIn this paper, a novel class of OPF algorithm is presented. It uses a novel three-phase unbalanced\nHELM presented in Section 2. Benchmarks are performed to test the performance of THELM and\nDIgSILENT Power Factory Newton-Raphson method described in Section 5.1. These benchmarks\nwere performed on various test networks. Mann-Whitney U test was performed, and it was concluded\nthat the results from both load flow methods were statistically indistinguishable and null hypothesis\nwas accepted. Using THELM, optimal power flow method was developed using genetic algorithm in\nSection 3, describing the type C class of algorithms. The novel Class C algorithm provides various\nadvantages over Class A and B OPF algorithms as discussed in Section 1. A use case with an objective\nfunction to minimize three-phase unbalance was applied to a real network in Austria in Section 5. The\nreason for choosing this objective is motivated by the requirements of the network operator and to\nhandle the unbalance locally. It involves the generation of active and reactive power schedules for\nfour controllable buses using smart-meter forecasts from other uncontrollable loads in the network\n(see Figure 1). Optimal schedules for these buses were generated and used to produce voltages using\nTHELM and the results were described in Figure 6. It can be observed that the three-phase voltage\nunbalance has reduced up to 39% and the optimal average objective function values can be observed\nin Figure 5.\nIn future work, the scalability and replicability of the method needs to be analyzed. The method\nneeds to be applied to various larger networks with large number of nodes. Simulation time and\ncode optimization is not considered a priority for this study. To use this method in a real-time or\nnear-real-time operation, the algorithm needs to be optimized. In this work, only three-phase unbalance\nminimization is used. OPF with various other objective functions need to be considered.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, B.V.R., F.K. and M.K.; Formal analysis, B.V.R. and M.K.; Investigation,\nB.V.R.; Methodology, B.V.R., F.K. and M.K.; Supervision, F.K. and M.K.; Validation, B.V.R. and F.K.; Visualization,\nB.V.R. and F.K.\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\nConflicts of Interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest.\nAppendix A.

The convergent\nand complex nature of a smart grid and the multifarious connection between its individual technology\ncomponents, as well as competition between private companies, which will exert substantial influences\non the future smart grid business, make a strategic approach necessary from the beginning of research\nand development (R&D) planning with collaborations among various research groups and from\nnational, industry, company, and detailed technological levels. However, the strategic, technological,\nbusiness environmental, and regulatory barriers between various stakeholders with collaborative\nor sometimes conflictive interests need to be clarified for a breakthrough in the smart grid field.\nA strategic R&D planning process was developed in this study to accomplish the complicated\ntasks, which comprises five steps: (i) background research of smart grid industry; (ii) selection of\nR&D target; (iii) societal, technological, economical, environmental, and political (STEEP) analysis\nto obtain a macro-level perspective and insight for achieving the selected R&D target; (iv) patent\nanalysis to explore capabilities of the R&D target and to select the entry direction for smart grid\nindustry; and, (v) nine windows and scenario planning analyses to develop a method and process\nin establishing a future strategic R&D plan. This R&D planning process was further applied to the\ncase of a Korean company holding technological capabilities in the sustainable smart grid domain,\nas well as in the sustainable electric vehicle charging system, a global consumer market of smart grid.\nFour plausible scenarios were produced by varying key change agents for the results of this process,\nsuch as technology and growth rates, policies and government subsidies, and system standards of\nthe smart grid charging system: Scenario 1, \u2018The Stabilized Settlement of the Smart Grid Industry\u2019;\nScenario 2, \u2018The Short-lived Blue Ocean of the Smart Grid Industry\u2019; Scenario 3, \u2018The Questionable\nMarket of the Smart Grid\u2019; and, Scenario 4, \u2018The Stalemate of the Smart Grid Industry\u2019. The R&D plan\nsuggestions were arranged for each scenario and detailed ways to cope with dissonant situations were\nalso implied for the company. In sum, in this case study, a future strategic R&D plan was suggested in\nregard to the electric vehicle charging technology business, which includes smart grid communication\nsystem, battery charging duration, service infrastructure, public charge station system, platform and\nmodule, wireless charging, data management system, and electric system solution. The strategic\nR&D planning process of this study can be applicable in various technologies and business fields,\nbecause of no inherent dependency on particular subject, like electric vehicle charging technology\nbased on smart grid.\nKeywords: R&D planning; patent analysis; sustainable smart grid technology; R&D strategy; STEEP\nanalysis; scenario planning; electric vehicle charging technology\n1. Introduction\nSmart grid is an electrical grid that uses information and communications technology to gather\ninformation regarding the behaviors of suppliers and consumers in an automated fashion to improve\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2907; doi:10.3390/su11102907 www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability119\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2907\nthe efficiency, reliability, economics, and sustainability of electricity production and distribution [1\u201312].\nThrough the construction of smart grid, the bi-directional transfer of electrical information allows for\nincreases in rational energy consumption and provides high quality energy and various supplementary\nservices. Furthermore, new business opportunities for green energy and electric automobiles are\nexpected to be established through the convergence of sustainable green technologies. Accordingly,\ntechnologically-developed countries, such as the United States of America (USA), Japan, China,\nand European countries, have established smart grid agencies to fund research on smart grid [1\u20134,13\u201317].\nFor the purposes of a convergent and complex system, like smart grid, a strategic approach is\nnecessary from the beginning of the research planning phase. Investment and research in various\nfields are essential due to the smart grid being a large-scale system on the national level. Additionally,\ncollaborations in research are mandatory, because the connection between the different technologies is\nsignificantly sizable. While the current linear economy utilizes resources to manufacture products and\ndisposes of them after consumption, the smart grid industry also meticulously aligns to the recent\ngrowth in interests of the circular economy framework, which aims to achieve a desired zero-waste\nsociety [18] through reusable, restorative and regenerative measures of wastes to retain as much value\nin producing new and renewed products or services [19\u201321]. Development in smart grid optimization\nis imperative due to its potential and innate aptitude to improve both the economic and environmental\npositions in support of the circular economy concept [22\u201324]. Furthermore, turbulent competition\nbetween numerous companies can exert substantial influences on the future smart grid business.\nResearch and development (R&D) planning for smart grid must be established in detail and ensued\nfrom national, industry, and company levels due to such diverse reasons.\nCurrently, strategic planning and research investments are being conducted in regard to smart\ngrid R&D on a national level [1\u20134,13\u201317]. However, such strategic R&D planning exclusively depends\non groups of experts from various technology disciplines pertaining to the smart grid. Through\nheavy reliance on expert opinions, a problem arises, as the research plan can be susceptible to skewed\nbiases [25,26]. For example, smart grid government funding can be misallocated toward certain\ntechnologies in favor of the interests of these experts for personal or political benefits, rather than\nfor the purposes of advancements of a smart grid. Thus, a systematic and methodological approach\nis vital to support expert opinions and further increase the legitimacy of the R&D planning process.\nThrough systematic R&D planning, rapid changes in technology, society, and environment can be\ncoped with, both dexterously and continuously.\nIn this study, a R&D planning process was developed based on patent analysis combined with\nscenario planning analyses and nine windows from the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (Russian\nacronym: TRIZ) [27] in order to construct decisive and strategic suggestions for the competitiveness of\nthe smart grid R&D business. With the developed process, strategic R&D planning was performed\non a smart grid company in conjunction to electric vehicle charging technology as a case study.\nFurthermore, this study has offered a proposition that can cover: (i) short-term strategies utilizing\ncurrent technologies or technological shortcomings and (ii) intermediate-term and long-term strategies\nemploying future prediction for new business opportunities. The resulting strategies of this study\nalso stretch beyond the classical reliance on the perspectives of experts by using a methodology-based\napproach, which can provide new, useful, and generally overlooked insights and advices. In addition,\nthe R&D planning process that is proposed in this study is not strictly tailored only for the purposes\nof smart grid, and it thus may be malleable and suitable for usages in other business R&D planning\nand strategizing activities for company R&D managers, technology policy and decision makers,\nand innovative individuals.\nThe rest of this paper consists of the sections, as follows: Section 2 describes research background,\nSection 3 depicts strategic R&D planning process, Section 4 portrays the application of the proposed\nmethod in a case study of Smart Grid R&D Planning for Hyosung Corporation, and Section 5 describes\nthe conclusion.\n120\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2907\n2.

Strategic R&D Planning\nIn general, one needs to establish strategic R&D planning ahead of discussing its methodology.\nR&D refers to \u201ccreative work that is undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of\nknowledge, including knowledge of man, culture, and society, and the use of knowledge to devise\nnew applications\u201d [28]. R&D can be frameworked in a systematic manner, as shown in Figure 1.\nThe evolution of R&D can be classified into several generations, as follows. The first generation\nof R&D comprises of technologies that are developed through the plethora of investments of past\nresearch, which originated from the intellectual curiosity of researchers of various disciplines. The R&D\ndriven by marketing for the purposes of marketability categorizes the second generation. As a result,\na trend of cooperation between the R&D and marketing departments and the individual projects\nfor new business starts to develop. The third generation is progressed from R&D projects that are\ninstigated via the strategies of enterprise corporation. Currently, the majority of global companies are\nstressing the importance and practice of the third generation R&D efforts. Since the beginning of the\n1990s, in particular, as companies\u2019 R&D activities have been combined with the enterprise corporation\nstrategy, establishing the direction of R&D investment according to strategic goals and markets has\nbecome more essential. Finally, the fourth generation extends beyond the third generation R&D by\nforecasting the future and reconfiguring the business strategy, which accentuates and centers around\nthe R&D strategy.\nPlan Do See\nFigure 1. Overview of research and development (R&D) Framework.\n2.2. Patent Analysis\nPatents are reports of the latest information, which reliably reflects contemporary technological\ndevelopments and changes. Thus, patent analysis is recognized as an essential process that is required in\nall assessments of technology trends and technology planning activities [29]. Furthermore, information\nthat was obtained from patent analysis has been utilized in a variety of instances with the advancements\nof R&D, in particular, for strategic R&D planning.\nStrategic R&D planning may be categorized into three stages [30]. As illustrated in Table 1,\nthe first stage of R&D planning is limited to simply patenting the developed technologies without\nthe consideration or application of available patent information. Typically starting from the second\nstage, patent information is used strategically and, however, the second stage of R&D strategies does\nnot extend beyond an investigation of the prior similar technologies and the defensive strategies\n121\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2907\nregarding patent infringement. Beginning from the third stage of R&D planning, patent information\nis deemed to be significant and is extensively utilized to its overall potential by comparison to the\nactivities of the first and second stage R&D planning. The patent information is manipulated for\nvarious purposes, including merger and acquisition (M&A) technology procurement, new business\nand product planning, patent valuation, patent licensing, and patent portfolios. Furthermore, the use\nof patent information for such purposes has become the core trend for the R&D planning activities of\ntechnology-based companies.\nTable 1. Utilization of patent analysis for each stage of R&D planning.\n1st Stage 2nd Stage 3rd Stage\nNo Strategy Defensive Strategy Offensive Strategy\nData, Information Information, Knowledge Knowledge, Intelligence\nPatent analysis can be divided into qualitative and quantitative patent analyses. Qualitative\npatent analysis mainly focuses on the technological information of patents in order to discover the\ncore patents and assess technological trends. In addition, patent citation analysis, patent network\nanalysis, and patent map analysis are conducted in qualitative patent analysis to extensively survey\nnot only patents as individual documents, but also as connected entities, for a deeper perception of\nthe technological domain. On the other hand, quantitative patent analysis generally involves the\norganization and illustration of bibliographical and technological data into graphical format. Through\nsuch quantitative analysis, the industry and domain trends of inventors, priority, nation, assignees,\nand citations can be apprehended.\n2.3. TRIZ: The 9 Windows Analysis\nGeneralizing technologies after the extensive analysis of 40,000 patents developed the Theory of\nInventive Problem Solving, or Teoriya Reshniya Izobretatelskikh Zadatch (TRIZ) [27]. Altshuller noted\nthat technology has followed certain patterns and rules in creating new inventive patentable ideas [31].\nTRIZ is a useful tool for analyzing technology and countless researchers from various disciplines have\napplied and validated it. Additionally, TRIZ techniques have been used in the case of technology\nforecasting and R&D planning activities [32\u201334].\nThe problem solving process of TRIZ, as illustrated in Figure 2a, converts a specific problem into\none of TRIZ\u2019s generic problems, which then is used to apply a generic solution. With a given generic\nsolution, this process is able to find a specific solution to the original specific problem. At a glance, this\nproblem solving process seems to be exceptionally elementary; however, innumerable complex TRIZ\ntools are being developed to reveal solutions to problems, and substantial research is continuously\nrequired to acquire the ability to convert unique problems into TRIZ\u2019s general problems. Despite\nsuch lingering difficulties, TRIZ remains as a dominant source in coping with problems that involves\nparticular aspects of technology, as well as diverse business problems at a company level.\nOther than TRIZ\u2019s widely known techniques, such as the 40 Inventive Principles, 76 Standard\nSolutions and Algorithm for Inventive Problem Solving, or Algoritm Resheniya Izobretatelskikh\nZadatch (ARIZ), process, there exists a vast collection of methodologies that have been developed.\nThese methodologies include Technology Evolution Patterns [35\u201337], Ideal Final Result technique [38],\nand nine windows technique [39], and more. The 40 Inventive Principles of Problem Solving method\nsolves the technical and physical contradictions [40] and it is \u201ccloser to application than the laws\nof technological systems evolution\u201d [41]. The 76 Standard Solutions help to solve system problems\nwithout identifying contradictions and they are applied to alleviate unwanted exchanges between two\nparts of a system [42], and ARIZ is a logical structure aimed to simplify a complex problem to be easier\nto solve [43].\n122\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2907\nFigure 2. (a) Theory of Inventive Problem Solving, or Teoriya Reshniya Izobretatelskikh Zadatch (TRIZ)\nanalysis process; (b) Nine Windows analysis; and, (c) Example of scenario planning.\nWhile such TRIZ techniques mainly focus on solving technical and physical problems for new\nproduct/process development, the nine windows technique was selected and adopted due to its\nuniqueness in describing how the target domain (system) and its super and sub systems evolve over\ntime to generate a holistic view of the smart grid industry [32]. The nine windows analysis is a\nmulti-dimensional technique that can aid in the prediction of the future by dividing the past, present,\nand future into sub-system, system, and super-system [39]. By examining the sub-system, system,\nand super-system of the present and the past of a technology, the corresponding three levels of the\nfuture can be more accurately comprehended (Figure 2b). What differentiates this method from other\nfuture foresight methods is the relevant utilization of the sub- and super-systems to predict the future\nin a structural manner.\n2.4. Scenario Planning\nScenario planning is a method that is used to deal with uncertainties in the future business\nenvironment [44\u201349]; Figure 2c illustrates a schematic example. The scenario perspective acknowledges\nthe inability to ideally predict the future, and thus prepares for the uncertainties of the future.\nMore specifically, scenario planning primes for the future through the attainment of planned solutions\nto each feasible and meaningful scenario, which is created with future uncertainty as its foundation.\nThe advantages of scenario planning are as follows:\n(i) future business opportunities are investigated via scenarios;\n(ii) plans are established by modification according to various different scenarios;\n123\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2907\n(iii) a clear direction of what capabilities are required in the future is suggested appropriately;\n(iv) current established plans can be tested for suitability under future circumstances; and,\n(v) crises and emergencies can be dealt with beforehand.\n3. Strategic R&D Planning Process\n3.1. Smart Grid Strategic R&D Planning Process\nIn this study, a strategic R&D planning process catered toward smart grid industry has been\ndeveloped and it is shown in Figure 3.\n \nPatent Analysis\nTRIZ\u2019s 9 Windows Analysis\nSTEEP Analysis\nScenario Planning Analysis\nSelection of R&D Target\nBackground Research\nFigure 3. Strategic R&D planning process for Smart Grid.\nFirst, thorough background research was performed to establish a strong foundation regarding\nthe smart grid industry. To achieve this, interviews with domain experts and policy makers were\nconducted in parallel to obtain a concrete understanding of research trends in smart grid, in addition\nto surveying smart grid related text books, reports, magazines, academic literatures, and internet\ndocuments. Furthermore, the perspective target of research has been selected. The selection of\nsuch a perspective target of research is essential, because the methods and details of the analysis\nare distinguishable, depending on whether the perspective target is a company, industry, or nation.\nThis study pinpoints a company as the target and its association with the smart grid industry. Since the\nsmart grid industry is quite vast with an eclectic array of different technologies and domains, this study\nfurther focuses on one of these for an in-depth analysis, rather than a superficial overview of the entire\nindustry containing little significance and credibility. This study also utilizes the societal, technological,\neconomical, environmental, and political (STEEP) analysis for the development probability of smart\ngrid industry, because the analysis is a suitable methodology that yields macro-level insights that are\nuseful for the direction in the beginning phase of research planning. The STEEP analysis pinpoints key\nelements that induce significant influences on the smart grid industry (Table 2) [48].\n124\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2907\nTable 2. Societal, technological, economical, environmental, and political (STEEP) analysis results of\nsmart grid industry.\nSTEEP Smart Grid Drivers\nEnvironmental\n\u2022 Reduce green-house gas emissions\n\u2022 Support and lower cost of Kyoto Compliance\n\u2022 Increase renewable energy generation\n\u2022 Improve energy efficiency\nRegulatory/Governmental\n\u2022 Respond to governmental mandates (i.e., UK, Netherlands, Sweden,\nUS, Australia, Brazil, etc.)\n\u2022 Support building renewable/distributed generation\n\u2022 Support performance-based rate making\n\u2022 Enable national security objectives\n\u2022 Facilitate wholesale and retail market efficiency\nEconomic\n\u2022 Improve reliability (e.g., decreased outage duration and frequency, etc.)\n\u2022 Reduce labor costs (e.g., meter reading and field maintenance, etc.)\n\u2022 Reduce system losses (e.g., better systems planning and asset\nmanagement, etc.)\n\u2022 Reduce non-labor costs (e.g., field vehicle, insurance and damage, etc.)\n\u2022 Provide revenue protection (e.g., better billing accuracy,\nprevention/detection of theft/fraud, etc.)\n\u2022 Provide new revenue sources (e.g., energy management, etc.)\n\u2022 Deferral of large capital projects (e.g., reduced generation\nrequirements, etc.)\nSocietal\n\u2022 Respond to consumer demand for sustainability and enhanced ability\nto manage their usage\n\u2022 Respond to customers increasing demand for uninterruptible power\n\u2022 Provide customer options for energy conservation\nTechnology & Infrastructure\n\u2022 Invest significant capital for development of new technology\n(improvement of existing technologies)\n\u2022 Replace outdated T&D infrastructure\n\u2022 Decreasing workforce (e.g., 50% of technical workforce are expected to\nreach retirement age in 5\u201310 years)\nT&D: transmission and distribution.\nSubsequently, starting with the target company\u2019s patents performs patent analysis; them,\nthe company\u2019s capabilities can be examined. In this case, the company\u2019s capabilities are evaluated\nin regard to the smart grid industry by exploring the company\u2019s patents, past developments and\nbusinesses, and changes in focus of areas and investments. With the company\u2019s capability information,\npatent analysis is conducted again to shed light upon the specific areas in which the company can\nexpect business opportunities. Through the analysis of the specific areas within the smart grid industry,\nrobust knowledge can be obtained to further investigate industry growth, development trends, core\ntechnologies and technology trends, and the insight of market competitors, thus offering a foundation\nfor strategic R&D planning activities.\nFinally, extending beyond the analyses of the target technology, future strategies can be established\nby using TRIZ\u2019s nine windows and scenario planning methodologies. Through the nine windows\nmethodology, the smart grid\u2019s current system and super-system can be analyzed to chronologically\ndraw a conclusion and prediction of the future\u2019s super-system and system. In detail, the current\nsystem\u2019s shortcomings (problems) are identified. After an evaluation of the specific problems at the\ncurrent system level, the problems of the current super-system are established. The most probable\nsolutions or portrayal of the future in accordance to the current super-system is formulated in the future\nsuper-system. Finally, under the assumptions that the future super-system holds true, specific future\n125\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2907\nsolutions at the system level are created. For example, while assuming that the current problem (current\nsystem) is the subpar or lack of internet access on commercial airplanes, the current super-system\nproblem is the lack of long-range tower or satellite infrastructure and the reliability of signal receiving\nantenna technology. The future super-system solution may become the advancement and dominance\nof satellite-provided internet connection. Assuming this development in satellite-provided internet,\nthe R&D plan would consequently suggest developing antennas that are specialized for satellite\nconnectivity as the solution.\nThe scenario planning is composed of six step processes, as follows. (i) Selection of core issues:\nRegarding what affairs, will decisions be made? (ii) Extraction of decision-making factors: What\nis required to be able to make decisions? (iii) Investigation of the motive for change: What is the\nsignificant cause for change? (iv) Abstraction of the scenario: What/which scenario is significant?\n(v) Dictation of the scenario: How will the future unfold? (vi) Establishment of counterstrategy: How\nwill the future be coped with? The resulting future system is utilized for R&D planning. In addition,\nthe uncertainties of future can be dealt with the scenario planning methodology through the creation of\nmultiple scenarios that are based on key change agents. A robust smart grid strategy can be established\nas a result of these processes.\n3.2. The Smart Grid Industry\nThe future of the energy industry is rapidly expanding towards an efficient and reliable smart\ngrid infrastructure. The smart grid industry and technologies can provide a variety of benefits, not\nonly for developed countries, but also for developing countries. The smart grid can: (i) increase the\nenergy efficiency; (ii) decrease the losses from the electrical grid; (iii) improve system performance\nand asset utilization; (iv) combine the sources of renewable energy; and, (v) actively cope with\nenergy demands. Particularly, since the 2000s, the implementation of smart grid has received much\nattention [1\u20134], especially after immense capital losses that result from frequent major blackouts and\ntheir consequent damages [6]. From the development of local microgrids [6,10,50] to country-level\ncase studies and R&D funding initiatives [13,17], significant strides toward smart grid planning\nand development have undergone thorough discussion, evaluation, and support, both nationally\nand internationally [14,15,51,52]. Furthermore, in support of the growing interests in the circular\neconomy concept, the smart grid possesses prodigious capacity to accommodate efficient, renewable,\nand reusable energy solutions to many aspects of the energy grid, e.g., power generation, distribution,\nand consumption [22]. Many research endeavors have been performed to address the capabilities\nand opportunities of smart grid in respect to the circular economy framework [18], most notably to\naddress the roles of digital and smart technologies [20,23] and the monitoring of energy generation [51],\ntransmission, distribution [52], consumption [53], and management [50\u201354] in smart grid scenarios [24].\nThe smart grid can be seen as a complete package that contains electricity generation, transmission,\ndistribution, and consumption [55], as illustrated in Figure 4. When the infrastructure for the smart\ngrid is constructed, the current electrical grid changes from a class-like composition with distinct\nroles (generation, transmission, distribution, and consumption) into a network structure where\nmultiple entities can simultaneously act as the consumer and the supplier. While the current electrical\ngrid is the infrastructure solely existing to supply electricity, the smart grid can be perceived as an\nevolved version of the electrical grid, in which home appliances, telecommunications, automobiles,\nconstructions, and energy are intertwined as a platform. The smart grid can allow a new era of\ninnovative and pristine businesses and technologies to propagate, such as bidirectional communication\nbetween the electric supplier and consumer, real-time payment systems, reactive response to demand\nfluctuations, and electric automobiles. Additionally, the smart grid has great potential to act as a strong\nfoundation for new developments that are aimed at renewable energy solutions alongside its native\nability to efficiently manage energy distribution and consumption, which is in line with the circular\neconomy concept.\n126\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2907\n \n\u2666\n\u2666\n\u2666\n\u2666\n\u2665\n\u2665\n\u2665\n\u2665\n\u2665\n\u2665\n\u2665\n\u2665\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2665\n\u2665\n\u2665\n\u2666\n\u2666\n\u2666\n\u2666\n\u2666\n\u2666\n\u2666\n\u2666\n\u2022\n\u2022\nFigure 4. Conceptualization of Smart grid features.\nIn this study, the fourth generation R&D phase was considered, as described in Section 2.1, from\nthe current third generation R&D processes in regard to smart grid industry. The R&D planning phase\nwas focused on predicting future technologies, create ideas, and extract company strategies based on\nR&D strategies. In general, prior to strategic R&D planning, efforts have relied heavily on groups of\nexperts from various domains. Although human efforts are ultimately needed to predict the future,\nestablish plans, and make decisions, the significance and demand for a systematic and methodological\napproach to cope with today\u2019s large upsurges of information and the rapid and drastic changes in\nsociety is growing.\nThe smart grid industry may comprise of five industry sectors [56]; Table 3 lists their core\ntechnologies and demands. First, the smart power grid sector can be perceived as the industry that\nincreases the reliability and management efficiency of electrical grid by integrating information and\ntelecommunications. The smart power grid technology can be further subcategorized into smart\ntransmission system, smart distribution system, smart power device, and smart power communication\nnetwork technologies. Second, the smart consumer sector focuses on increasing energy efficiency\nthrough communications infrastructure that provides consumers with an assortment of different\nservices. The smart consumer sector consists of automated meter infrastructure, energy management\nsystem, and bidirectional communications network technologies. Third, the smart transportation\nsector concentrates on the generation of new business opportunities through the unrestricted two-way\nconnectivity of electrical grid to electric vehicles. Furthermore, this technology aids in reducing\nemissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen monoxide, and sulfur\noxide, and in increasing the efficiency of grid through its sub-sectors, such as electric vehicle parts\nand materials, charging infrastructure, and vehicle-to-grid technologies. Fourth, the smart renewable\nsector allows for the renewable energy sources to successfully and stably link with the current electric\ngrid by managing the obstacles that hinder the supply of renewable energy. This area comprises of\n127\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2907\ntechnologies of micro-grid, energy storage, power quality, and power exchange infrastructure. Finally,\nthe smart electricity sector aims to increase the electric grid\u2019s efficiency through developing various\nelectric billing schemes and consumer electric transactions system, as well as a reactive response to\ndemand and unrestricted electricity trade between all stakeholders. This sector consists of smart real\ntime pricing, smart demand response, and smart power exchange technologies.\nTable 3.

Case Study: Hyosung\u2019s Smart Grid R&D Planning\nHyosung Corporation is a Korean industrial conglomerate that was founded in 1957. It operates\nin various fields, including power systems, industrial machineries, chemicals, information technology,\nconstructions, and trades. Among Hyosung\u2019s eclectic specialties, this case study has aimed to focus on\nstrategic R&D planning to enhance the competitiveness of the smart grid business sector within the\nHyosung Corporation.\n4.1. Patent Analysis\n4.1.1. Patent Analysis: Hyosung Corporation\nIn this case study, the patents that Hyosung Corporation currently possessed since its establishment\nwere searched and analyzed; the total number of patents that are owned by Hyosung amounts to\n4398 patents. The majority of these patents were registered in the period of 1998 to 2018; only 371 patents\nwere filed for the first forty years (1957\u22121997) since Hyosung was founded. As shown in Figure 5a,\nthe number of patents increased to a maximum 126 in 1998, corresponding to 34% of the total number\nof the patents disclosed for the first forty years. However, it turns to be reduced to 116 in 1999 and\n128\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2907\nreached a minimum 47 in 2000. The number of patents slowly increased again to 69 in 2001, 63 in\n2002, 98 in 2003, and 139 in 2004. Here, it is noted that the lowest numbers of patents in the period\nof 2000 to 2002 might be attributed to the severe economic crisis of Korea that started at the end of\n1997. The number of patents drastically increased to 324 in 2005 and it reached a maximum 358 in 2006.\nAgain, in the last quarter of 2008, the global recession is speculated to have caused the rapid decline in\nregistered patents since its maximum in 2006. Thereafter, the number of patents annually fluctuates in\nan upward trend. Overall, these patent data reveal a trend that Hyosung has maintained continuous\nR&D growth, despite the Korean economic crisis and global recession.\nFigure 5. Hyosung\u2019s annual number of patents disclosed in the period of 1998 to 2018: (a) all possessed\ntechnologies (total 4027 patents); (b) technologies disclosed to smart grid: electric power components\nand systems, solar energy components and systems, wind energy components and systems, and battery\ncomponents and systems (total 661 patents).\nThe analysis of all Hyosung patents exhibits an active surge in patent registrations across all areas.\nThe corporation has possessed patents in diverse areas that are mainly converged around polymers\nand downstream products (fibers, tire cords, films, sheet, blends, and composites), chemicals, banking\nmachines, electric power components and systems, solar energy components and systems, wind energy\ncomponents and systems, and battery components and systems. Overall, the patent analysis confirmed\nthat the company has engaged and invested in robust R&D activities since around 2003.\nThis study has further narrowed the scope of analysis by concentrating on patents pertaining to\nspecific areas, such as electric power components and systems, solar energy components and systems,\nwind energy components and systems, and battery components and systems, which have direct\nassociations with the smart grid. As a result, 661 patents were selected for further analysis. It is\nobserved that the patents and technologies that are related to the smart grid begin to proliferate starting\n2003 and continue to increase overall (Figure 5b). It can be noted that the decline of patents related to\nsmart grid in 2014 may be a repercussion of the 2008 global recession. A recession can directly impact\nR&D related expenditures in the form of employee layoffs, project terminations, and budget cuts in\nforthcoming R&D proposals. Additionally, accounting for the time required for R&D to yield patentable\nresults and the one- to two-year duration that is required for patent registration, the aftershock of\nthe 2008 recession seems most evident in explaining the decrease in numbers of patents that were\nregistered in 2014. The increase in patent numbers after 2014 may be an indication of recovery from\nthe recession.\nThe technologies of Hyosung Corporation that were disclosed to smart grid in the period of\n1998\u22122018 could be categorized into transformers, switchgears, electronic devices, electronic systems,\nwind turbine systems, solar systems, battery systems, and other related components, as illustrated in\nTable 4 and Figure 6. For key technologies, such as (a) transformers, (b) switchgears, (c) electronic\ndevices, and (d) electronic systems, the numbers of patents start to increase from 2007 and steadily\n129\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2907\ncontinued growth up to today (Figure 6a\u2013d). Differently, the development of wind turbine systems has\nbeen intensively carried out only for the period of 2006\u22122014 (Figure 6e). A similar trend of patent\nfilings is discernible for solar cells and systems, as well as for batteries and their systems (Figure 6f\u2013g).\nIt is noteworthy that a sharp increase of patents has been registered on the solar cells and their systems\nin the period of 2009\u22122013. The registration of patents on batteries and systems has been conducted\nin 2006 to 2014. While taking into consideration of the buffer time to prepare patent submissions,\nthe concentration of research activities in these key smart grid technology areas began in around 2003\n(namely, a few years after the Korean economic crisis), which coincides with when Hyosung started to\ntranslate their R&D outcomes into intellectual properties. Overall, the patent data is testimony that\nHyosung has devoted significant amounts of investments and research on key smart grid technology\nareas. As a result, Hyosung has achieved substantial technological competitiveness within the smart\ngrid domain.\nFigure 6. Hyosung\u2019s annual number of the patents registered for smart grid technology components:\n(a) Transformers; (b) Switchgears; (c) Electronic devices; (d) Electronic systems; (e) Wind systems;\n(f) Solar systems; (g) Battery systems; and, (h) Others.\n130\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2907\nTable 4.

In particular, the possessed technologies have\ncompetitiveness in the smart power grid industry, smart transportation industry, and smart renewable\nindustry. Through the utilization of the capabilities of transformers and switchgear technologies as\na basis, high potential exists regarding entering the smart transmission system business and smart\ndistribution system business within the smart power grid industry. Additionally, the entry barrier for\nthe electric vehicle components and charging infrastructure businesses of the smart transportation\nindustry is considerably low when situating the capabilities of battery systems, electric motors,\nand electronic systems as a foundation. Aside from these business entry possibilities, Hyosung\u2019s\npatented technologies can provide a strong base to potentially succeed in entering the core of the future\nenergy industry, the smart renewable energy business, and the smart grid system solution business.\nFigure 7. The map of Hyosung\u2019s technologies and smart grid industry relations.\n4.1.2. Patent Analysis: Electric Vehicle Charging System\nThis study has selected electric vehicle charging infrastructure business as a focal point for further\nanalysis. The smart grid allows for electric vehicles to be cost-effectively and efficiently charged\nthrough selective power usage. For example, electric vehicles can be charged during the night if the\nprice of electricity becomes cheaper as the demand of electricity decreases. Not only does this enable\nelectric vehicle fuel prices to decrease, but this also alleviates the problems that result from the long\ncharging hours that are required for electric vehicle batteries. The remainder of this section analyzes\npatents regarding electric vehicle charging methods.\nThe convenient and effective charging of electric vehicles is a world-wide issue. Thus, 15,820 patents\nthat were filed to Korea, USA, Europe, Japan, and China in the period of 2002 to 2018 for electric vehicle\ncharging technology were retrieved (Table 5). Among these patents, 414 patents have been selected for\nanalysis after filtering the noise and directly unrelated patents (Table 5). There is a discernible trend\n131\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2907\nin the patent registration, as shown in Figure 8. The registration of such patents begins in the early\n2000s. Only one to four patents are annually registered until 2007. Thereafter, the number of registered\npatents rapidly increases every year, reaching to a maximum (58 patents) in 2011. It turns to decrease\nto 44 in 2012 and 40 in 2013, reaching a minimum (28 patents) in 2014. Subsequently, it again turns\nback to increase to 34 in 2015, 48 in 2016, and 53 in 2017. Nevertheless, in 2018 it again drops to 24.\nTable 5.

Annual number of patents disclosing battery charging technology.\nThe patents have been further analyzed in regional bases (Figure 9; Table 5). In Korea, the first\npatent of electric vehicle charging technology appears in 2004. Subsequently, the patent registration of\nthis technology was actively done between 2009 and 2012, and then declined thereafter. Although\nsimilar trends of patent filing are observed in USA and Japan, the overall number of filed patents is\nslightly higher in USA or much higher in Japan, when compared to that of Korea. However, a slightly\ndifferent trend of patent filing activity is observed in China. The first patent was filed in 2006 and two\nadditional patents in 2008. Afterwards, the number of patent filing has drastically increased, reaching\na maximum (44 patents) in 2017. Even in 2018, the number of patents is 26, which is still very high\nin comparison to the other countries. In contrast, the activity of patent registration is very slow and\nfurthermore very weak in Europe. Overall, the share fraction of patents is 9.4% for Korea, 10.4% for\nUSA, 1.2% for Europe, 35.5% for Japan, and 43.5% for China. These data confirm that Japan and China\ndominate the patent registrations, followed by USA, Korea, and Europe. In general, a few years of\nresearch are necessary for filing patents. Taking this fact into account, it is evident that, for the recent\nseventeen years, aggressive research and investments have been devoted worldwide to develop more\nefficient and more convenient charging technology for electric vehicles.\n132\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2907\nFigure 9. Annual number of regional patents: (a) Korea (KR); (b) United States of America (U.S.A.)\n(US); (c) Europe (EU); (d) Japan (JP); (e) China (CH); and, (f) Regional patent distributions.\nAs mentioned above, the R&D of electric vehicle charging technology has been carried out\nin the fierce competition among the Asian region (Korea, Japan, and China), the American region\n(USA), and the European region. These competitive R&D works have been found to be led by top\n28 organizations, as shown in Figure 10. In particular, the State Grid Corporation of China, Toyota Motor,\nKawamura Electric, Hyosung, Mitsubishi, Sharp, LSIS, JFE Engineering, and China Electric Power\nResearch have played dominant leading roles by holding the majority of electric charging technologies.\nHyosung and LSIS represent Korea within the top nine applicants. Among the Korean automobile\ncompanies, only Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors are barely listed within the top twenty-eight patent\napplicants. In addition, it is noteworthy that three universities, namely Kookmin University, KAIST\n(Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology), and Tsinghua University, are ranked within the\ntop twenty-eight applicants. Overall, the R&D of electric vehicle charging technology has been driven\nmainly by automobile, electric power, heavy engineering, and electronic companies. Additionally,\nthere exist instances where academic research groups have worked and filed patents conjointly with\nsuch leading companies.\nFor the electric vehicle technology patents, a thorough and meticulous examination has been\nperformed for each patent to ultimately survey trends in the technology R&D. Furthermore, key\ndevelopment factors have been selected in order to categorize the patent data pool. Subsequently,\nthe core patents of the electric vehicle charging system technology have been chosen. Figure 11 presents\nthe analysis results. In the 2000s, research effort has been focused to develop electric vehicles, batteries,\ncharge methods, charging devices and controls, private power station, and charge infrastructure; these\nR&D efforts have been continued until recently. In the late 2000s, such developments have begun\nto emerge in the charging methods and charge control domains. As the developments of individual\nparts and equipment have matured, the charge service, infrastructure, and system developments have\nstarted to emerge from the 2010s to today. Three main key R&D factors have been extracted through\nthe patent analysis of electric vehicle charging technologies. These three factors consist of the electric\nvehicle battery technologies, the technologies to charge batteries, and the technologies to efficiently\nmanage data via the smart grid. These key R&D factors are organized into specified R&D targets and\ndirections, matched with respective relevant patents, and are summarized in Table 6.\n133\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2907\nFigure 10.

Strategy Based on Patent Analysis\nThis section is dedicated towards suggesting an entry strategy that is based on R&D targets\nin regard to the electric vehicle charging system by examining Hyosung\u2019s smart grid capabilities.\nIn comparison with the other areas of Hyosung, little research has been conducted in this field.\nNevertheless, Hyosung has established a better position in the R&D of battery systems and charging\nsystems, when compared to all other competitors in the world, as discussed in the earlier section.\nMoreover, recent increases in patents reflect the escalation of its research. When considering that the\neffective data management field is still an unexplored area in the world market, the battery system and\ncharging system area is expected to be a promising opportunity, under the assumption that Hyosung\nconcentrates its capabilities from its power management system into information and communications\ntechnology, and continues R&D efforts in this area.\nThe battery performance and charging technology, among all electric vehicle related areas, has\nbeen the most actively researched area. Notably, Japanese companies currently possess the technologies\nof the highest standards, as well as the bulk of the core technologies. Nevertheless, research of battery\nperformance will proceed to the continual advancements in performance of electric vehicles. Although\nthe Japanese competitors possess many of the core technologies regarding the performance of electric\nvehicle battery technologies, the opportunities exist, given that Hyosung allocates its capabilities of\npower equipment and battery technology to conduct research in reducing battery charging durations.\nVarious charging methods are closely related technologically and, more importantly, highly\ninterconnected to the electric vehicle charging industry\u2019s business model. Though several business\nmodels have been developed, there has yet to be a model that can be recognized as a world-wide\nstandard. This area is not limited to the development of charging technologies, but it must incorporate\nthe developments of an all-inclusive mixture of the power equipment system, service, and infrastructure.\n4.2. Future Strategy\nThis research goes beyond technological analysis by establishing a strategy from a business\nperspective. TRIZ\u2019s nine windows and scenario planning methodologies have been utilized to provide\na strategy from a business point of view.\n4.2.1. The 9 Windows Analysis\nIn order to stimulate the market of electric vehicles, a consumer-friendly and convenient, not to\nmention efficient, electric vehicle charging system is a vital element. The electric vehicle charging\nsystem must be able to use cost-reduced power during the night and to minimize the problems faced\nduring demand data management and demand fluctuations to properly coincide with the goals of the\nsmart grid industry. The electric vehicle charging system has been analyzed at the current system and\nsuper-system levels in a consecutive manner to achieve these. Figure 12 shows the analysis results.\nThe current problem at the system level pertains to the problems with performance, implementation,\nand expansion of private charging stations. A 24 kWh Nissan Leaf charged into a normal Level 1\n(1.4 kW) residential outlet for roughly twelve hours only recharges the battery to half capacity and\nwould cost approximately $60 per month; and, it costs $1500\u2013$2200 for users to install a Level 2\n220-volt (6.6 kW) system, which is capable of fully charging the car in seven hours [45]. Essentially,\nlong charging time, the cost of electricity, and private charging unit installation are some of the major\nissues in electric vehicle charging. For the super-system, system standardization is considered to be a\ngeneralized problem of the system due to the lack of a global standard in place for electric vehicle\ncharging, which consequently affects the expansion of charging infrastructure, a vital element that is\nrequired for electric vehicle adoption [57]. For the future super-system, the current issues of industry\nstandardization are resolved and the vitalization of smart grid technologies and its benefits have\ninstated. In correspondence to this super-system, the future system of electric vehicle charging is\n136\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2907\nexpected to promise the expansion of highly available, affordable, and rapid charging stations, where\nthe company can position its R&D planning activities.\n \n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nFigure 12. Results of the nine windows analysis for smart grid industry in conjuction to electric vehicle\ncharging technology.\nThe contemporary plan and development of electric vehicle charging system is close to that of the\ncurrent gasoline station. Although research is attempting to solve the biggest issue of the charging\nsystem, namely extensive charging durations, twenty-minute boosted charging, and five-hour slow\ncharging stations are being implemented at present. The implementation of ultra-fast charging stations\nis being contemplated, but the expensive costs are acting as an unavoidable obstacle. In addition,\nprivate charging stations incur limitations, since user data management is difficult to the point where\ndemand prediction is overly complex to satisfy the efficiency standards for the smart grid.\nIn its current state, it is a world-wide plan to set a universal standard for the smart grid charging\nsystem. Domestically, basic systems requirements and safety regulation standards have been arranged;\nand similarly, the US, Europe, and Japan have proceeded to create their own national standards.\nPreparation in advance is essential, because the universal standardization of the smart grid charging\nsystem will set the world-wide norm.\nThe progress toward the smart grid is becoming factual in the future super-system. When the\nsmart grid becomes activated, the smart grid\u2019s advantages must be sufficiently utilized. For example,\nthe cost-reduced power during the night is selectively used by the consumer, and, through data\nmanagement, the predictions of demand and supply are accurately accomplished. Furthermore,\n137\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2907\na surplus of different charging systems will be provided to fit and satisfy individual lifestyles\nand preferences.\nPredicting the future system based from what was foreseen in the future super-system, the charging\nsystem infrastructure must be customized to fit into all types of housing environments. For example,\nthe charging systems are implemented within the apartment housing parking facilities for each parking\nspot, and to implement water-proof enclosures for outdoor charging units for other types of parking.\nMoreover, payment system and data management system developments are required in maintaining\nthe charging infrastructure. The scenario planning technique is utilized to fine tune the directions of\nthe R&D plan with the resulting future system and super-system as a reference to guide the types of\nelectric vehicle charging innovations.\n4.2.2. Scenario Planning\nThis research uses scenario planning to establish strategies for countering the extracted plausible\nfuture scenarios. Key change agents, namely technology and growth rates, policies and government\nsubsidies, and system standards of the smart grid charging system, were generated and combined\naccordingly to produce the following four most plausible scenarios (Table 7).\nTable 7. Future smart grid industry scenarios.\nScenario Technology Rate Growth Rate Regulation Standardization\n1 Fast Fast Low (support) Uniformity\n2 Fast Fast Low Diversity\n3 Fast Slow High Uniformity\n4 Slow Slow Low Diversity\nIn Scenario 1 (The Stabilized Settlement of the Smart Grid Industry), the future setting can be\nhypothesized as the following. The advancement of the technology is sufficient; the growth rate of\nthe smart grid and electric vehicle charging system industry is accelerated; government subsidies are\nstrongly supportive; and, the industry standard is strictly uniform. In this scenario, related markets\nare growing, and innumerable companies are heavily investing in R&D in the hopes of entering the\nsmart grid industry. Although this is a prime instance for successful opportunities, the strictly uniform\nstandardization policy plays a significant role in determining the outcomes of such opportunities. It is\nvital to recognize and closely monitor the standardization policies as the key change agent from a\ncompany\u2019s perspective. Regardless of the supremacy and excellence of a technology, if the technology\nstrays from the standardization guidelines, then the risk of failure is inevitable.\nIn order to prepare for Scenario 1, the company must avoid investing in a new all-inclusive\ncharging system, and focus R&D expenditures on the development of various modules or a platform\nthat concurs with the current and predicted standards. It is suggested to capture the business\nopportunities in developing individual modules and related technologies that lie within the boundaries\nof the standards, since the future charging system will diversify into varied businesses.\nScenario 2 (The Short-lived Blue Ocean of the Smart Grid Industry) can be described as the\nenvironment, where adequate advancements of technology, rapid growth rates, hefty government aid,\nand the freedom from standardization are harmonized. It may seem that all of the stars have aligned\nin this scenario, where all of the external factors are in favor for opportunity. However, in this scenario,\nthe lack of regulation of any form results in a highly competitive atmosphere and causes rapid and\nimpulsive advancements of the technology.\nAs a result, an aggressive plan is required to cope with such competition. This plan must\nencompass continuous R&D activities in a portfolio of different technologies. Not only is it essential\nto invest in incremental improvements of existing technologies, but it is more important to prepare\nand further invest into the future to maintain competitive advantages. For example, while developing\ntechnologies that enhance the performance of existing charging systems, investments into disruptive\n138\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2907\ninnovative technologies are crucial. It is speculated that the future representative technology may\nbecome wireless charging technology and robotic charging [58]. The patent analysis results show that\nwireless charging related technologies have developed starting the late 2000s, though the wireless\ntechnology is still in its early stages and far from commercialization for smart grid applications.\nHowever, similar to how the wireless charging technology is becoming commercialized for small\napplications, like cellular phones, the wireless charging technology has great potential to solve certain\nproblems of the electric vehicle charging system. In short, Scenario 2 illuminates a future filled with\nprosperity and success, but the need for concentrated R&D efforts in disruptive innovations is a\ndifficulty that cannot be disregarded.\nIn Scenario 3 (The Questionable Market of the Smart Grid), the future can be represented as a\nsituation where ample developments of technology exist and continue to be improved, but the smart\ngrid market is showing slow growth; in addition, governmental grants are low and the standardization\nis strict. Thus, the situation, where companies have heavily invested in the smart grid industry, but\nare struggling in difficult times due to a combination of factors mentioned, is commonplace across\nthe market.\nIn order to cope with Scenario 3, the company must look towards industry-convergence\ntechnologies. More specifically, in order to survive through such unfortunate events, the company\nmust search for other industries where the developed smart grid technologies can be applied, and,\nonce another industry is found, the existing smart grid technology must be adjusted to fit its new\nindustry. Instead of focusing on converging technologies, like the electric vehicle charging system,\ntechnologies that have higher potential to be connected to other industries, such as data management\ntechnologies, should be emphasized. To conclude, the solution for this scenario is to be selective in\nchoosing the technology to be developed, with one that has high amounts of possible connections with\nother industries.\nScenario 4 (The Stalemate of the Smart Grid Industry) describes one of the worst cases a company\ncan face, and is as follows: Slow market growth and technology development, and incumbents have\nbegun to cut further investments. Basically, Scenario 4 is the case where the smart grid industry fails to\nsettle as a significant entity of the future energy industry.\nThe solution to Scenario 4 represses the investments into new technologies and promotes the\nfocus on R&D efforts into technologies that maintain competitiveness. Hypothetically, Hyosung could\nredirect its focus on its existing power equipment and system solution technologies to overcome these\ndifficulties. The company can place emphasis on technologies that have the potential to enter into the\nsmart grid industry if and when the smart grid industry situation does improve due to the high risks\nthat are involved with continuing investments in new technologies in the smart grid industry.\nIn summary, it is critical to note that quarterly assessments of changes in technology, market,\nindustry standards, and policy is required to quickly adjust R&D plans accordingly. R&D planning\nbased on scenarios 1 and 2 would result in strong thrusts for developments in the electric vehicle\ncharging domain. From the analysis, the proper assessment of national and global governmental policies\non subsidies or regulations and industry trends regarding standardization will further determine\nwhether to direct the company\u2019s R&D plans to focus on the development of smart grid modules\nor platforms, or to focus on innovating disruptive technologies to obtain or maintain competitive\nadvantages. The consideration of global policies is important, in particular, policies of allied countries\nthat may have a conforming effect on local legislations on electric vehicle charging. When considering\nscenario 1, it can be suggested that the company invest into demand-side management modules\ntargeting the enhancement of user convenience. Under the scenario where the adoption of electric\nvehicles is increasing, and industry standardization is uniform, R&D plans and expenditures must\ncater more heavily to meet the consumers\u2019 needs and approval. Alternatively, under scenario 2,\na manager of R&D can propose the expansion of breakthrough developments into robotic charging\nstations, renewable energy sources, wireless electric vehicle charging, and energy storage solutions\nfor electric charging infrastructure for competitive advantages over other industry contenders. Such\n139\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2907\ninvestments would be valuable as the number of users of the electric vehicles increase and continue to\ndesire more accessible, quick, and easy-to-use charging stations. Additionally, heavy investment into\nenergy storage solutions can be suggested for developing charging stations that are able to balance the\nload of larger and higher power stations. In light of the lacking number of electric vehicle charging\ninfrastructure available for users, it has been stated that battery storage can assist in the acceleration of\nthe construction of charging stations, and consequently boost electric vehicle adoption.\nUnder the situation where scenarios 3 and 4 are imminent, the company should explore other\nareas where the incumbent technologies can be applied for new opportunities. Further investing\ndirectly into new smart grid technologies could be detrimental to the company. Comprehensive\nevaluation of existing technologies may provide solutions towards novel innovation. In accordance\nto scenario 3, it is suggested for the company to converge its electric vehicle charging technologies\ninto areas, such as hydrogen charging stations and data management solutions. Although converging\nexisting technologies into a new industry will require an appropriate assessment of the advantages\nand disadvantages of the particular area, the accurate selection and transfer of the electric charging\ntechnologies can act as a gateway for future developments and prevent developed technologies from\nbecoming obsolete. Assuming scenario 4, the company is suggested to focus R&D plans on existing\npower equipment and system solution technologies that are closely related to the smart grid industry,\nsuch as energy storage systems, data center solutions, and power transmission and distribution\ninfrastructure. These areas are some of the company\u2019s most developed technologies, which, with\nfurther R&D investments, are sustainable revenue sources whilst encompassing the ability to transition\ninto electric vehicle charging infrastructure in preparations for a possible positive turn for the smart\ngrid industry.\n5. Conclusions\nIn this study, a strategic R&D planning process for the smart grid industry was developed.\nThe planning process is comprised of background research in the smart grid industry, selection of\nperspective R&D target, STEEP analysis, patent analysis, and TRIZ\u2019s nine windows and scenario\nplanning analyses to develop a method and process in establishing a future strategic R&D plan.\nThe developed planning process was applied to the Hyosung Corporation perspective in the\nstrategic planning of smart grid R&D as a case study. The patent analysis confirmed that Hyosung\nhas devoted significant amounts of investments and research on key smart grid technology areas\n(i.e., transformers, switchgears, electronic devices, electronic systems, wind turbine systems, solar\nsystems, battery systems, and other related components) since around 2003, and, as a result, already\nachieved substantial technological competitiveness within the sustainable smart grid domain, including\nsmart power grid, transportation, and renewable energy. With the patent analysis results, TRIZ\u2019s nine\nwindows and scenario planning analyses were further performed to produce a strategic R&D plan from\nthe business point of view. From this case study, a strategic smart grid R&D plan for Hyosung to enter\nthe sustainable smart grid industry was suggested and further entered into the sustainable electric\nvehicle charging technology business. The strategic R&D plan comprises of smart grid communication\nsystem, service infrastructure, battery charging duration, public charge station system, platform and\nmodule, renewable energy sources, wireless charging, data management system, and electric storage\nsystem solution as key technology and business factors. To achieve the goals of the strategic R&D\nplan, a set of four scenario plans were suggested by taking into consideration technology and growth\nrates, policies and government subsidies, and system standards of the smart grid charging system\nas key change agents: Scenario 1, \u2018The Stabilized Settlement of the Smart Grid Industry\u2019; Scenario 2,\n\u2018The Short-lived Blue Ocean of the Smart Grid Industry\u2019; Scenario 3, \u2018The Questionable Market of the\nSmart Grid\u2019; and, Scenario 4, \u2018The Stalemate of the Smart Grid Industry\u2019. The R&D plans in accordance\nto each scenario were recommended. In scenario 1, the company R&D plan is to pursue investments in\ndevelopment of various modules or a platform that concurs with the current and predicted standards,\nsuch as demand-side management modules targeting the enhancement of user convenience. Under\n140\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2907\nscenario 2, the suggested R&D plan is to emphasize a diverse portfolio of different technologies with\nincremental and disruptive innovations, such as robotic charging, wireless charging, and energy\nstorage solutions, to gain and maintain a competitive advantage in this regulation-less, competitive\nenvironment. Scenario 3 is a high uncertainty situation with a strong technological supply-side push,\nbut lacks the market growth and government support. In this scenario, the resulting company R&D\nplan suggests that R&D endeavors to concentrate on convergent technologies that have the potential to\nbe introduced into new industries, such as data management products and services. Finally, scenario\n4 restrains the investments into new technologies and it promotes the focus on R&D efforts into\ntechnologies that maintain competitiveness or further investment into incumbent technologies, such\nas data center solutions and power transmission and distribution infrastructure. The strategic R&D\nplanning process of this study can be used in a variety of different ways within the smart grid industry\nby reselecting the target to other businesses. Moreover, the planning process can be applicable in\nvarious technologies and businesses, because of the independence of any specific subject or business\narea.

However, physical improvements have limitations, and there is a paradigm shift\ntowards energy research based on occupant behavior. Furthermore, the rapid increase in the number\nof single-person households around the world is decreasing residential energy efficiency, which is\nan urgent problem that needs to be solved. This study prepared a large dataset for analysis based\non the Korean Time Use Survey (KTUS), which provides behavioral data for actual occupants of\nsingle-person households, and energy usage pattern (EUP) types that were derived through K-modes\nclustering. The characteristics and energy consumption of each type of household were analyzed,\nand their relationships were examined. Finally, an EUP-type predictive model, with a prediction\nrate of 95.0%, was implemented by training a support vector machine, and an energy consumption\ninformation model based on a Gaussian process regression was provided. The results of this study\nprovide useful basic data for future research on energy consumption based on the behaviors of\noccupants, and the method proposed in this study will also be applicable to other regions.\nKeywords: occupant behavior; single-person household; energy consumption; Korean Time\nUse Survey; EnergyPlus; data mining; K-modes clustering; support vector machine; Gaussian\nprocess regression\n1. Introduction\nApproximately 40% of global energy is consumed in buildings, and residences account for\napproximately 3/4 of the total energy consumption in buildings [1]. Energy consumption in residences\nis expected to continuously increase until 2040 [2]; consequently, active research is being conducted on\nenergy savings in residences [3\u20135]. Since energy consumption in the residential sector accounts for a\nlarge part of total energy consumption, energy saved in this sector through continuous research and\ntechnological development will have a positive impact on the reduction of total energy consumption\nand greenhouse gases.\nTo examine the research trends related to residential energy, the paradigm is shifting toward\nan emphasis on the behaviors of occupants, as well as the physical and environmental factors that\naffect energy consumption [6\u20139]. The behaviors of occupants are considered an important factor that\naffects residential energy consumption since, given identical physical and environmental situations,\nenergy consumption may still differ depending on the behaviors of occupants. Previous studies have\nindicated that occupants behaviors are a major factor in energy consumption, and have therefore\nSustainability 2019, 11, 245; doi:10.3390/su11010245 www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability144\nSustainability 2019, 11, 245\npredicted energy consumption based on these behaviors. However, researchers are facing difficulties\nin data collection due to privacy issues [10].\nThe recent increase in single-person households due to demographic changes is becoming an\nissue in various fields of research, and residential energy researchers are also paying attention to this.\nYu et al. [11] investigated future scenarios of energy consumption through demographic changes,\nand anticipated that the increase in single-person households would increase energy consumption\nand carbon emissions, arguing that energy consumption measures must consider these factors.\nIn South Korea, which is the target region of this study, single-person families have steadily increased\nsince 1975. According to the Population and Housing Census [12], which was conducted in 2015,\nsingle-person households account for 27.2% of all households, emerging as the main household type\nin South Korea.\nAccording to a study on single-person households and residential energy, the increase in\nsingle-person households has decreased the total energy consumption per household but doubled\nthe power consumption of residential energy. This is due to the fact that even with only one\noccupant, energy consumption efficiency decreases with the use of basic household appliances [13].\nThus, energy experts are pointing out the problems with the increasing number of single-person\nhouseholds, and the need for countermeasures. Previous studies found that energy research, based\non the behaviors of occupants, was necessary to effectively reduce energy consumption in residences.\nIn particular, they observed demographic changes from the global trend of increasing single-person\nhouseholds and recognized the importance of, and the need for, research into energy consumption in\nsingle-person households.\nTherefore, this study derives types of \u201cenergy usage patterns\u201d (EUPs) using K-modes clustering\nfor single-person households in South Korea. In addition, energy consumption data were extracted\nfrom EnergyPlus based on the behaviors of occupants, and three types of energy consumption data\n(total energy, cooling, and heating) were provided for each EUP type using a Gaussian process\nregression, in order to improve the use of this studies results. Finally, based on the results of a\nsupport vector machine (SVM), a model for predicting EUP types was implemented via household\ncharacteristics and living patterns.\n2. Materials and Methods\nIn Section 2, we describe the overall research process, the data, and methods used for the purposes\nof the research.\n2.1. Research Process\nFigure 1 shows the research process for creating a model to predict EUP types with energy\nconsumption information, according to the behaviors of single-person households in South Korea.\n145\nSustainability 2019, 11, 245\n \nFigure 1. Research process for predicting energy usage pattern types with energy\nconsumption information.\n\u2022 Step 1: Build 5193 EUP datasets by redefining 5193 \u201cKorean Time Use Survey (KTUS)\u201d data\npoints [14] through codes related to energy consumption.\n\u2022 Step 2: Derive EUP types by performing K-modes clustering analysis with the EUP dataset built\nin Step 1.\n\u2022 Step 3: Create 5193 \u201coccupant schedules\u201d to become inputs into EnergyPlus using the EUP dataset\nbuilt in Step 1. Implement representative residential environments of Korean single-person\nhouseholds, and extract 5193 points of \u201cenergy consumption data\u201d based on occupant behaviors\nthrough energy simulation.\n\u2022 Step 4: Provide an \u201cEnergy Consumption Information\u201d model for three items (total, cooling,\nand heating) for each type through a Gaussian process with the EUP types and energy\nconsumption data, which are the results of Steps 2 and 3, as input.\n\u2022 Step 5: Train the SVM model to predict EUP types through 5193 occupant features and EUPs,\nand verify the suitability of the model through the test process of the trained predictive model.\n2.2. Generating EUP Datasets from the Korean Time Use Survey\nThe purpose of the KTUS is to determine the lifestyles of Koreans for 24 h and provide basic data\nfor policy formulation and academic research in the sectors of labor, welfare, culture, transportation,\n146\nSustainability 2019, 11, 245\netc. [15]. The KTUS is performed every five years in 800 regions in South Korea. The survey data\nlargely consist of three parts: Residences, residents, and time logs. This allows us to understand basic\ninformation and living patterns of the residents. The time logs are created for 144 times slots that\ndivide 24 h into 10-min units based on the actual living pattern of residents. The behaviors and places\nof the residents in each time slot are recorded as codes. The behavior classification codes consist of\nnine major categories, 42 middle categories, and 138 subcategories. These data allowed us to find out\nthe detailed behaviors of residents. Furthermore, it includes the residents\u2019 location information, which\nallowed us to find out what the residents did at specific locations in their residences. We obtained the\nKTUS data through the Microdata Integrated Service (MDIS) [14].\nIn the KTUS data for 2014, which was obtained through the MDIS in this study, 5240 pieces of\ndata were collected that satisfied the conditions of urban residents, with household members 10 years\nor older in single-person households. Among them, 5193 KTUS data points were used for this study,\nexcluding 47 data points in which the residents were not in their residences for 24 h.\nFirst, to perform the K-modes clustering and EnergyPlus analysis based on the KTUS data, the\n138 pieces of behavior classification data were redefined as codes related to energy consumption, as\nshown in Figure 2.\nFigure 2. EUP data code definitions according to 5193 resident behaviors in the KTUS.\nApplications related to energy consumption in the residences were assumed to be related to\nlighting, computer, TV, washing machine, refrigerator, gas range, and hot water usage. Occupant\nbehaviors were classified into eight energy consumption behaviors by identifying which application\nwas used [16].\nThe location of the occupants was divided into inside and outside the residence through the\n\u201cbehavior location\u201d information of the KTUS; when the occupant was outside the residence, it was\nset as Away (A1). Refrigerators are assumed to operate continuously regardless of the presence or\nbehavior of occupants. By identifying which application was used according to the occupants\u2019 behavior,\nthe behaviors were classified into the behavior codes of: Leisure (L1), Laundry (L2), Cooking (C1),\nGrooming (G1), and Dishwashing (D1). In addition, when the occupant slept, it was assumed that\nthe lights were out, and the behavior was classified as Sleeping (S1). Behaviors that were not directly\n147\nSustainability 2019, 11, 245\nrelated to energy consumption were defined as Other (O1). Table 1 lists the energy application and\nenergy consumption behavior codes defined through this process.\nTable 1.

Deriving EUP Types and an Energy Consumption Information Model for Each Type\n2.3.1. K-Modes Clustering\nClustering is a machine learning analysis method used for various purposes, such as pattern\nanalysis, grouping, and classification. Among the clustering methods, K-means clustering, which was\nfirst proposed by MacQueen [17], finds appropriate center values by clustering data that have the most\nsimilar shapes from the centers of k items that have been randomly selected, and combines them into\na group of items that have similar characteristics. This is the most popular clustering method, it is\nhowever limited in that it can only be applied to data consisting of numerical variables [18]. K-means\nclustering is not appropriate for this study because clustering must be performed with categorical\nvariables consisting of behavior classification codes rather than numerical variables.\nTo complement the limitations of the existing K-means clustering, Huang [19] proposed K-modes\nclustering. K-modes clustering is applicable to data formats consisting of categorical variables rather\nthan numerical variables. Categorical variables refer to data that cannot be expressed by numbers,\nsuch as men and women. These data only provide information but cannot express quantities such\nas numbers.\nK-modes clustering is composed of a distance function for measuring the distance between objects,\nand a cost function for optimized analysis. These functions are explained in detail below.\nD is a set of objects X, which consist of nominal variables. The number of X\u2019s is n, and D =\n[X1, X2, . . . , Xn](1 \u2264 i \u2264 n). If object Xi has m nominal variables, Xi = [xi,1, xi,2, . . . , xi,m](1 \u2264 j \u2264 m).\nZ is a set of k cluster centers, and Z = [Z1, Z2, . . . , Zk](1 \u2264 l \u2264 k). If Zl , which is the center of\ncluster Cl , has m nominal variables, Zl = [zl,1, zl,2, . . . , zl,m] (1 \u2264 j \u2264 m).\nThe equation for obtaining the distance between the center of cluster Cl , Zl = [zl,1, zl,2, . . . , zl,m],\nand the object Xi = [xi,1, xi,2, . . . , xi,m] through the distance function is as follows:\nDistance function : d\n(\nxi,j, zl,j\n)\n=\n{\n0, xi,j = zl,j\n1, xi,j \u000e= zl,j\n, (1)\nwhere d\n(\nxi,j, zl,j\n)\nis a function for measuring the distance between Zl and Xi, and calculates the\ndistance between two objects by comparing the jth variables. The distance between each object X and\nthe cluster center Z is calculated through Equation (1), and the model is optimized in such a way that\nthe result value of Equation (2) is minimized:\nCost function : P(U, Z) = \u2211kl=1 \u2211\nn\ni=1 \u2211\nm\nj=1 ui,ld\n(\nxi,j, zl,j\n)\n(2)\n148\nSustainability 2019, 11, 245\nU = [ui,l ] is an n \u00d7 k matrix consisting of 0 and 1. ui,l = 1 indicates that object Xi is assigned to\nthe closest cluster Cl . To optimize the model, the cluster center is reset, and this is repeated until the\nminimum value of the cost function P(U, Z) is obtained. Then, the analysis is stopped, and the result\nof the cluster analysis is derived.\nThis study aims to derive EUP types using K-modes clustering, which consists of the following\nprocess. First, a dataset for 144 time slots for 5193 objects was prepared through the EUP codes defined\nin Section 2.2 (Table 2). The analysis environment was built through the K-modes clustering algorithm\nsuggested by Huang [19] using Python 3.6.\nTable 2.

The K-modes clustering analysis and the method of finding the optimized k\nis as follows:\n1. Select k random cluster centers.\n2. Calculate the distance between each object and cluster center, and allocate each object to the\nclosest cluster center. Allocate every object to clusters, and move the cluster center in the direction\nfor which the distance between each object and cluster center becomes minimized.\n3. Compare the center of the moved cluster with the previous center. If the result is different, return\nto Step 2 and repeat. The analysis is stopped if the same result value, when compared with the\nprevious center, is generated.\nFinally, to select the optimized k, k is found by drawing an elbow curve using the errors of the model\nfor each k (Figure 3). In this study, k = 7 was found to be the most optimized model through visualization\nof the analysis results 6, 7, and 8, which had small variations in the error reduction in the elbow curve.\nFigure 3. Elbow curve for error values of the model for each k.\n149\nSustainability 2019, 11, 245\n2.3.2. EnergyPlus\nEnergyPlus is a dynamic energy simulation based on the strengths of Building Loads Analysis and\nSystem Thermodynamics (BLAST) and DOE-2 in the U.S. in 1996 [20]. EnergyPlus can implement more\nconcrete building materials and facility systems, and makes it easier to control facility systems than do\nother energy simulations [21]. Furthermore, EnergyPlus can consider the behaviors of occupants in the\nsimulation. It is widely used in energy research that considers the behaviors of occupants. The use of\napplications, cooling and heating, and natural ventilation can be controlled in 1-min units according to\nthe behavior of occupants, resulting in a simulation environment that is more similar to real-world\nsituations. Therefore, in this study, 5193 energy consumption amounts were derived based on the\noccupant behavior through EnergyPlus.\nThe target building of this study is located in a residential area, and the inside of the building has\na floor plan that is typical in South Korea. Hence, it can be regarded as a representative residence type\nfor single-person households in South Korea (Figure 4). Happy houses are for households consisting\nof one or two persons, such as college students, newlyweds, and career starters. The construction of\nhappy houses started in 2014, and the goal was to build 150,000 happy houses by 2017 [22]. For this\nstudy, we obtained the design drawings and energy savings plan for the \u201cS Happy House\u201d from the\nKorea Land and Housing Corporation (LH), which we used as the basic data for accurate energy\nsimulation. S Happy House was a 41 m2 unit on the fourth floor of a building in Seoul and was certified\nas Class 3 in the energy efficiency rating system, and can be used as a reference for energy consumption\nin future research. The fourth floor, which is the middle floor of the residential floors, was selected\nbecause the top and bottom floors are heavily influenced by the external environment [23].\n \n(a) \nFigure 4. Cont.\n150\nSustainability 2019, 11, 245\n(b) (c) \nFigure 4. The \u201cS Happy House\u201d located in Seoul, which is the energy simulation target area:\n(a) The target site located in a residential area; (b) a bird\u2019s-eye view of the S Happy House; (c) a floor\nplan for the 41 m2 module.\nThe main inputs and settings for the EnergyPlus simulation are listed in Table 3. The five main\ninput items of EnergyPlus are the environment, building information, cooling and heating systems,\napplications, and occupant schedules.\n1. The input data for \u201cEnvironment\u201d included the location, which was based on the latitude and\nlongitude of the target site, Greenwich Mean Time, surrounding city environment, and weather\ndata. This was the external environment information that affected the building energy.\nFor weather data, which was not provided by EnergyPlus, the \u201cKorea standard weather data\u201d\nfrom Seoul were used [24].\n2. \u201cBuilding Information\u201d included a 3D model, material, and the composition of the simulation\nobject. To build a simulation environment that was similar to the actual environment, we received\nthe energy savings plan and drawings of the S Happy House from LH.\n3. For the \u201cCooling and Heating System\u201d, a wall-mounted air conditioner and floor heating system\nwere applied [25]. The cooling and heating temperatures for a comfortable indoor environment\nwere set as 20 \u25e6C and 26 \u25e6C, respectively, by referring to the Certification Standard for Building\nEnergy Efficiency Rating and Zero Energy Building [26]. Water was delivered from an external\nsource, but hot water was heated through an individual boiler.\n4. \u201cApplications\u201d include electric lights, refrigerator, TV, computer, washing machine, and gas\nrange. For the power standards of these applications, the \u201cSurvey Of Household Appliance\nPenetration And Household Power Consumption\u201d was referenced [16].\n5. \u201cOccupant Schedules\u201d corresponds to every schedule used for simulations based on the\noccupant\u2019s behaviors. In this study, 5193 data points obtained through the KTUS were used.\nThe physical elements such as the S Happy House and surrounding environment were constructed\nusing SketchUp 2017, through the drawings received from LH. Furthermore, the framework of the\ncooling and heating systems structure was constructed by converting the three dimensional (3D) model\nwith OpenStudio2.5.1. The Korean standard weather data for Seoul were converted to an epw file\nfor weather data to input into EnergyPlus. Based on the EUPs derived in Section 2.2, 5193 occupant\nschedules were created.\n151\nSustainability 2019, 11, 245\nAs shown in Figure 5, 5193 IDF files is the extension name for the EnergyPlus were created\nthrough the collected information, from which 5193 energy consumption data points were finally\nobtained through the EnergyPlus simulation.\nTable 3.

Gaussian Process Regression\nGaussian process regression (GPR) [27] is a black box model that can flexibly cope with nonlinear\ndata using a Bayesian approach. It is appropriate for highly uncertain energy research because it can\nperform probabilistic prediction (Figure 6) [28]. Research is being conducted to build energy-related\nmodels using GPR [29\u201332]. In this study, an energy consumption information model was provided\nthrough GPR using the daily energy consumption data for 365 days according to each EUP type.\nFigure 6. Two different Gaussian process models: A general predictive model and probabilistic\npredictive model. Source Reference [28].\nGPR is a linear regression model estimated from n training data {(xi, yi); i = 1, 2, . . . n}, as shown\nin Equation (3). When the mean is zero and the variance is \u03c32, \u03b5 is Gaussian noise, as shown in\nEquation (4). \u03b2 is a coefficient estimated from the data, and xT is expressed as an input vector:\ny = xT \u03b2 + \u03b5, (3)\n\u03b5 \u223c N\n(\n0, \u03c32\n)\n. (4)\nWhen a training dataset is given, the post distribution of \u03b2 can be estimated through the Bayesian\napproach, which consists of a pre-distribution and a likelihood functions. The equation of the GPR\nmodel is composed of a mean function shown in Equation (5), and a covariance function shown in\nEquation (6). Because the mean function has a value of zero, it can be expressed as Equation (7):\nE( f (x)) = m(x), (5)\nk\n(\nx, x\u2032\n)\n= E[{ f (x)\u2212 m(x)}{( f (x\u2032)\u2212 m(x\u2032)}], (6)\nf (x) \u223c GP(0, k(x, x\u2032)). (7)\nTherefore, f (x) has a zero mean and follows the covariance function k(x, x\u2032). The covariance\nfunction can be defined as various kernel functions, such as squared exponential, exponential, matern,\nrational quadratic, and automatic relevance determination. The most universal function is the\nsquared exponential kernel (SE) function [33], which is widely used in building energy prediction\nresearch [28,34\u201337]. In this study, the SE method was adopted, and the kernel function is expressed\nas Equation (8). k(x, x\u2032) is parameterized by the kernel parameter or hyper parameter \u03b8, and k(x, x\u2032)\nis dependent on the \u03b8 value. Therefore, it can be expressed as k(x, x\u2032|\u03b8) . Here, \u03c3f denotes the signal\nstandard deviation, and \u03c3l denotes the characteristic length scale:\nk\n(\nxi, xj\n\u2223\u2223\u03b8) = \u03c32f exp[\u221212\n(\nxi \u2212 xj\n)T(xi \u2212 xj)\n\u03c32l\n]. (8)\n153\nSustainability 2019, 11, 245\nFor the GPR tool, the statistics and machine learning toolbox of MATLAB R2018b were used.\nFor the algorithm, Williams et al. [33] was referenced. For a detailed explanation of the equation,\nthe MATLAB User\u2019s Guide [38] can be referenced. To predict the energy consumption by EUP type for\n365 days in this study, three energy consumption information models were created for total energy,\ncooling, and heating for each type, with x as the date and y as the daily energy consumption data.\n2.4. Methodology for Predicting EUP Types Used by the SVM\nSVM is a model that can solve the classification and regression problems through supervised\nlearning. The SVM model can effectively respond to various problems because it can be applied to\nlinear and nonlinear problems [39]. The idea behind SVM is to create lines or hyperplanes that classify\ndata into classes [40]. Therefore, it creates lines or hyperplanes that can distinguish different outputs\n(i.e., classes) by entering input x and output y data. SVM models include linear, quadratic, cubic,\nfine Gaussian, medium Gaussian, and coarse Gaussian SVMs, depending on the kernel function for\nimplementing the lines or hyperplanes that distinguish classes (Table 4). In this study, six SVM models\nwere trained through the Classification Learner App of MATLAB R2018b, and the most appropriate\nSVM model was selected [38].\nTable 4. Six SVM models put through the Classification Learner App of MATLAB R2018b.\nSVM Type Model No. Kernel Function Kernel Scale Mode Multiclass Method\nLinear SVM 1.1 Linear kernel Auto *\nOne-vs-One **\nQuadratic SVM 1.2 Quadratic kernel Auto *\nCubic SVM 1.3 Cubic kernel Auto *\nFine Gaussian SVM 1.4 Gaussian kernel 3.1\nMedium Gaussian SVM 1.5 Gaussian kernel 12\nCoarse Gaussian SVM 1.6 Gaussian kernel 49\n* When you set the Kernel scale mode to Auto, the software uses a heuristic procedure to select the scale value;\n** only for data with three or more classes. This method reduces the multiclass classification problem to a set of\nbinary classification subproblems, with one SVM learner for each subproblem. One-vs-One trains one learner for\neach pair of classes.\nTo train the SVM model, input data x and output data y are required. The x data provide\ninformation for predicting y, and consist of the factors affecting y. The y data are the results obtained\nfrom x, and y is the answer that we want to eventually obtain through the predictive model. In this\nstudy, x consisted of five occupant features and 144 EUP data points. Furthermore, the EUP types\ndefined by K-modes clustering in Section 2.3.1 correspond to y.\nTable 5.

Many studies have been conducted on occupant\nbehavior and energy consumption according to occupant features [41\u201343]. In this study, a predictive\nmodel for the SVM EUP type was constructed using occupant features and EUP, and the dataset for\nthis is shown in Table 5.\n154\nSustainability 2019, 11, 245\n3. Results and Discussion\nAs a result of the research, Section 3 has the following contents. Seven EUP types of single-person\nhouseholds have been derived in South Korea. In addition, we analyzed the differences in household\ncharacteristics and energy consumption of each type and constructed an energy information model\nthrough Gaussian process regression. Finally, we developed an EUP type predictive model with 95%\naccuracy through SVM.\nDeriving the EUP Types and Analysis of Occupant Features through K-Modes Clustering\nAs a result of K-modes clustering with 5193 EUP data points using the method outlined in\nSection 2.3.1, seven EUP types of single-person household occupants were derived. The household\ncharacteristics of seven EUP types based on the analysis results can be seen in Figure 7, which visualizes\nthe energy consumption behavior probability of occupants by time slot for the seven EUP types, and in\nTable 6, which outlines the five household characteristics used in the SVM.\nFigure 7. Energy consumption behavior probability by time slot for the seven EUP types derived\nthrough K-modes clustering.\n\u2022 Type 1 was a cluster that mainly consists of people aged 65 or older (51.7%) with low incomes.\nThey were mainly involved in outside activities between 04:30 and 09:00, and in indoor activities\nin the residence at other times.\n\u2022 Type 2 had the highest ratios of household members who are 65 or older (66.0%), female (68.8%),\nhad monthly incomes less than 1 million won (75.8%), and had care needs (65.78%). They had\nalmost no outside activities or hobbies. Their main space of activity was their residence.\n155\nSustainability 2019, 11, 245\n\u2022 Type 3 had the highest ratio of economic activities (81.4%), and their daily work started in the\nafternoon, after 13:00. After their economic activities were finished in the late evening, they\nmainly slept in their residence between 04:00 and 13:00. Besides sleeping, their activities related\nto energy consumption were few, and their living patterns were irregular.\n\u2022 Type 4 spent a similar amount of time in the residence as Type 1. Their genders, monthly incomes,\nand jobs were similar, but their age was different. The time slot for the main outside activities of\nType 4 was 18:00 to 22:30. They spent a high percentage of time in hobby activities in their residence.\n\u2022 Type 5 had a sleeping time period similar to that of Type 3, but after sleeping they mainly spent\ntime in their residence enjoying hobbies. They went out in the evening between 22:00 and 08:00.\n\u2022 Type 6 had a high percentage of youth who were active in economic and outside activities, with\nthe lowest ratio of people aged 65 or older (9.0%). Furthermore, they spent the shortest amount of\ntime in their residences. The main activity in the residence was personal hygiene, and they had\nthe least amount of time spent on other activities.\n\u2022 Type 7 comprised 2074 out of the 5193 data points. This seemed to be the living pattern type\nof general office workers. However, based on the percentage of those 65 years or older (45.4%)\nand without work (51.2%), this type also included people who spent their personal time mainly\noutside their residence, besides office workers.\nTable 6.

Comparison of Energy Consumption by EUP Type According to the Energy Simulation Results\nA total of 5193 energy simulations were performed based on occupants through EnergyPlus.\nTo compare the energy consumption among the seven EUP types, the data were expressed as boxplots,\nas shown in Figure 8. The analysis was performed for five categories: Electric light, applications,\ncooling, heating, and total energy consumption for one year. Furthermore, to facilitate the comparison\nof energy consumption, a ranking list was prepared for each item, as shown in Table 7.\nFigure 8. Comparison of the total annual energy consumption for lighting, applications, cooling,\nheating, and the overall total for each EUP type.\n157\nSustainability 2019, 11, 245\nAs shown in Table 7, the annual total energy consumption was the highest for Type 2, followed by\nType 1, Type 7, Type 4, Type 5, Type 6, and Type 3, respectively. Type 1 and Type 2 ranked highest for\nall five items. They seem to be largely affected by the occupancy time, need for a comfortable indoor\nenvironment, and personal life. For Type 2, the percentage of households that had care needs was\n65.78%, and, since they had a high percentage of people staying at home, they had the highest energy\nconsumption. Furthermore, Type 2 had the highest energy consumption, which was twice as high\nas that of Type 3, which had the lowest energy consumption in the same conditions (except for daily\nliving pattern).\nTable 7. Energy consumption ranking by type.\nType 1 Type 2 Type 3 Type 4 Type 5 Type 6 Type 7\nLighting 2 1 6 3 5 7 4\nEquipment 2 1 7 4 5 6 3\nCooling 2 1 6 3 4 7 5\nHeating 2 1 7 4 5 6 3\nTotal 2 1 7 4 5 6 3\nType 4, which had a similar occupancy time as Type 1, showed lower energy consumption in\nevery item. The largest differences in household characteristics between the two types were age\nand occupancy time slot. Type 4, which had a high percentage of youth, mainly saw occupants\nspending time for sleeping, leisure, and personal management. Type 1, which had a high percentage\nof elders, had large energy consumption amounts for residential environment maintenance, such\nas food preparation and dishwashing. Even though their occupancy times were similar, the energy\nconsumption patterns of the two types were different due to the differences in household characteristics\nand living patterns.\nFurthermore, there were some cases in which the occupancy time was long, but the energy\nconsumption was low. Type 4 had a longer occupancy time than did Type 7, but Type 7 had greater\nenergy consumption in applications and heating. Type 7, which had similar household characteristics\nas Type 1, had high energy consumption for applications because their living pattern focused on\nmaintaining their residential environment. In the case of heating energy, unlike Type 7, Type 4\nhousehold members stayed at home during the day when the outside temperature was higher in\nthe winter, and because their time outside was short, they consumed less energy in returning the\nindoor temperature to a proper, comfortable temperature. However, in the summer, Type 4 members\nconsumed higher cooling energy than did Type 7 due to the high outdoor temperatures during the\nday. It appears that Type 7 reduced energy consumption due to cooling energy by maintaining the\nindoor temperature at 26 \u25e6C or lower through natural ventilation during the evening. This was clearly\nseen through a comparison of Type 5 and Type 6, which had opposite time slots for staying at home,\nalthough their occupancy times were similar.\nAccording to Fong et al. [44], age and sex influence energy consumption, and the higher the\npercentages of elders and women, the higher the energy consumption was. The results of this study\nalso suggest that age and sex have a large effect on energy consumption. Out of the seven types, Type 1,\nType 2, and Type 7 had the highest percentages of people 65 years or older, and they correspond\nto 1st, 2nd, and 3rd for their annual total energy consumption, and all three types had the highest\npercentages of women. Next, Type 4 and Type 5, which ranked 4th and 5th, respectively, also had a\nhigher percentage of women than men. Type 6 and Type 3, which ranked 6th and 7th, respectively,\nhad a higher percentage of men. Therefore, these results suggest that age and sex can cause differences\nin lifestyles and energy consumption.\nIncome and work had an effect on occupancy time, and caused differences in energy consumption.\nType 3, Type 5, and Type 6 had jobs, and the higher the income, the lower the energy consumption was.\nFor Type 3 and Type 5, the percentage of people with jobs was 81.4% and 93.9%, respectively. According\n158\nSustainability 2019, 11, 245\nto a previous study on energy consumption based on income for Koreans, the higher the economic\nlevel, the lower the constraints for energy consumption and the higher the energy consumption to\nmaintain the environment of residence [45,46]. However, in this study, the higher the income, the lower\nthe energy consumption was. This result seems to be because of the nature of single-person households;\nthe more actively they are involved in economic activities, the higher their income, and the lower their\noccupancy time in the residence are.\nb. Energy Consumption Information Model for Total Energy, Cooling, and Heating for Each Type Through\nGaussian Process Regression\nTo provide energy consumption data for each EUP type, GPR was performed, as described\nin Section 2.3.3, and the information model for total energy, cooling, and heating was created.\nThe information model is composed of three elements. The total model (Figure S1) can identify\nthe overall energy consumption pattern. The cooling (Figure S2) and heating (Figure S3) models are\nmost heavily influenced by the climate. To examine the energy consumption by period, the three\ninformation models are presented in the Appendix A [47].\nIn the figures in the Appendix A, the blue dots indicate the actual data, and the red dots comprise\nthe boundary representing a 99% confidence interval. A larger space between the top and bottom\nlines means greater diversity in energy consumption. The black solid line is the mean value where the\nlargest amount of data is located. The top and bottom 99% prediction interval lines are drawn above\nand below this line.\nc. Predictive Model of EUP Types Through Occupant Features and EUPs\nThe predictive model was evaluated through six SVMs, according to the kernel function types and\noptions presented in Section 2.4. Each model was trained using 80% of the total data as the training\ndata, and the model was evaluated with 20% data. As a result, the prediction rate of each model was\nas shown in Table 8. Thus, Model 1.2 was most appropriate for predicting the EUP type.\nTable 8. Comparison of the prediction rates of six SVM models.\nSVM Type\nModel\nNo.\nPrediction Speed\n(No. of Observations Per s)\nTraining Time\n(s)\nAccuracy\n(%)\nLinear SVM 1.1 ~1900 7.6457 94.0%\nQuadratic SVM 1.2 ~1300 8.1307 95.0%\nCubic SVM 1.3 ~1400 8.4946 94.5%\nFine Gaussian SVM 1.4 ~170 57.533 51.6%\nMedium Gaussian SVM 1.5 ~1300 9.383 93.8%\nCoarse Gaussian SVM 1.6 ~1000 12.078 91.0%\nTo examine the prediction performance of Model 1.2 in detail, a confusion matrix was drawn,\nas shown in Figure 9. The probabilities that the EUP-type prediction model would accurately predict\nthe type were generally high: 42%, 93%, 96%, 90%, 75%, 98%, and 97%, respectively, according to\ntype. However, when we examined Type 1 and Type 5, which showed relatively low prediction rates,\nit seemed that they were not sufficiently trained because they had a smaller number of data points\ncompared to other types. This issue could be improved if we were to acquire more data in the future.\nTherefore, the EUP-type prediction model with a prediction rate of 95.0% was implemented through\nSVM. The results of this study showed applicability of EUP prediction in other countries and regions.\n159\nSustainability 2019, 11, 245\nFigure 9.

Research and\ndevelopment of technologies to reduce energy consumption in residences is being actively conducted.\nHowever, the improvement of physical elements in buildings has limitations for energy reduction\npurposes. The paradigm is shifting towards considering the behaviors of occupants, as a means\nof overcoming these limitations and to create sustainable energy savings in the residential sector.\nAlthough studies considering the behaviors of occupants have been conducted, there have been\ndifficulties due to limitations in data collection and privacy issues. Furthermore, it is difficult to\nanalyze the behaviors of occupants because of their inherent complexity. This study attempted to\novercome this limitation through data mining.\nThis study prepared large datasets for analysis based on the KTUS, which provides behavior data\nof actual residential occupants. Furthermore, EUP types were derived through K-modes clustering,\nand the household characteristics and energy consumption of each type were analyzed. As a result of\nK-modes clustering, seven EUP types were derived. Comparisons of the five household characteristics\nand energy consumption among the types revealed that people aged 65 or older and females had\nhigher amounts of energy consumption than other groups. Unlike the results of previous studies,\nwe found that the higher the economic level of a resident, the lower the energy consumption was,\nbecause of their occupancy time and occupancy time slots. This can be considered a characteristic of\nsingle-person households. The energy consumption showed a two-fold difference depending on the\nEUP type. Finally, an EUP-type prediction model with a prediction rate of 95.0% was implemented by\ntraining an SVM, and an energy consumption information model provided through GPR.\nThe processes of deriving the EUP types based on actual behavior data, energy simulation,\nand implementation of the EUP-type prediction model and the energy consumption information\nmodel, can be used as basic research data in future studies based on the behaviors of occupants,\nand they can be applied to other regions. In addition, EnergyPlus, Openstudio, and Python used in\nthis study are open-source software and can increase the usefulness of this study in the future.\nThe limitation of this study is that the energy consumption data were created through energy\nsimulations. If this limitation can be overcome, the outputs of the obtained research, through the\n160\nSustainability 2019, 11, 245\nprocess used in this study, can help prepare the framework for a building occupant energy management\nsystem in the coming era of smart buildings, which will lead to energy savings in the residential sector.\nThere is also a limitation that the subject of this study is limited to single-person households. Recently,\nhowever, technology development and research on smart cities and buildings, enabling data collection,\nis in progress and a smart monitoring system for occupants will be available. Once the monitoring\nsystem is established, energy management will be possible considering the energy consumption\npatterns of occupants. The limitations could be overcome if later studies were conducted from data\ncollection of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in multi-person households.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/1/245/s1,\nFigure S1.

In recent years, more\ncritical views have been expressed based on theories of social practice, arguing that smart meter\nfeedback ignores the role of various mundane practices where energy and water are consumed and\ninstead targets individuals as active decision-makers. We present a review of qualitative studies\non smart meter feedback and results of a survey to European smart metering projects. We argue\nthat theories of social practice can be used to reframe the challenges and potentials of smart meter\nfeedback that have been identified in the literature and our survey. This presents challenges of\nsmart meter feedback as resulting from normalised resource intensive practices rather than from\nuninterested and comfort-loving individuals. Potentials of improving the effectiveness of smart meter\nfeedback relate to supporting communities and peer-learning and combining smart meter feedback\nwith micro-generation of renewable energy. This has implications for how domestic energy and water\nconsumption is targeted by policy.\nKeywords: smart metering; feedback; households; energy and water consumption; theories of\nsocial practice\n1. Introduction\nEnergy consumption is a key contributor to climate change, and a continuously increasing level\nof energy consumption is unsustainable with the current energy mix that is heavily based on fossil\nfuels [1]. Water consumption in many parts of the world has already exceeded sustainability limits,\nleading to declining groundwater levels and river flows in densely populated areas [2]. While water\nscarcity itself is a problem, household water usage is also closely linked to energy consumption due to\nwater heating.\nDemand management is increasingly seen as a way to decrease both overall consumption of\nresources such as energy and water and to deal with peak loads that are particularly problematic\nfor system management. Demand management can involve different types of energy users but in\nthis paper, we focus exclusively on households. Smart metering has been identified as an important\nelement of demand side management and the development of smart grids [3,4] that would lead to a\ntransition towards low carbon energy systems.\nSmart metering can be linked to the concept of energy transition. There is no standard definition\nof energy transition, but it usually refers to a change in an energy system, involving for example,\nchanges of fuel sources, technologies and a whole set of actors including suppliers, distributors and end\nusers [5,6] or structural changes in the way energy services are delivered [6]. In this paper we use the\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3553; doi:10.3390/su10103553 www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability168\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3553\nterm energy transition to refer to a systemic change from (the current), fossil-fuel based energy system\nwhere residents are mere consumers of energy, towards a system based on intermittent renewable\nenergy sources and also involving power generation in smaller units, including the household and\ncommunity level. The role of residents is expected to change in future smart energy systems and\nconcepts of \u2018energy citizen\u2019 or \u2018citizen-consumer\u2019 and \u2018co-provider\u2019 have been used to describe\nresidents who are actively engaged in the management of energy [7,8]. There are already examples\nof communities of front-runners in which learning from peers has contributed to increasing energy\nefficiency [9\u201311]. In a more critical context, the concept of \u2018Resource Man\u2019 has been introduced [12],\nreferring to the ideal energy consumer that smart metering projects are targeted to.\nThe objectives of smart electricity metering range from peak load management and reducing total\ndemand to fraud detection and accurate billing [13] (p. 447). In the case of water metering, improved\nleak detection is also an important factor motivating smart meter roll-outs, in addition to the aim of\ndecreasing the overall consumption of water e.g., [14]. There is variation in what residents see of the\nmeters, from no direct information to in-home displays, websites or mobile applications visualising\nconsumption in real-time [15].\nLarge smart metering roll-out programs are under way or being planned throughout the\ndeveloped countries. It is expected that by 2020 nearly 72% of European consumers will have a\nsmart meter for electricity and 40% for gas [16]. The Energy Efficiency Directive of the EU also\nencourages the use of in-home displays [17], and the EU\u2019s 2015 Strategic Energy Technology Plan\nemphasises the need to provide smart solutions for energy consumers to enable them to optimise their\nenergy consumption (and production) [18].\nDespite the expectations for smart metering, empirical analyses of the effects of smart meter\nfeedback show mixed results. Some review studies have indicated energy or water savings within\nthe range of 5 to 15%, at best nearly 30% [14,19\u201321]. A meta-analysis looking at the effect of different\ninformation and feedback strategies on energy consumption found an average reduction of 7.4%,\nwith the most effective interventions including relatively high involvement such as home audits\nand individual energy consultation [22]. Some studies report modest (2\u20134%) reductions [23] or no\nstatistically significant reductions [24,25]. Studies looking at the effect of smart meter feedback have\nbeen criticised for not being always able to differentiate between the effects of feedback, self-selection\nbias of the participants and/or the Hawthorne effect (participants behaving differently because they\nknow they are taking part in a study). The long-term sustainability of achieved savings has also been\nquestioned [26\u201328]. As a result, a growing body of literature questioning the optimism related to\nsmart meter feedback has emerged [29]. This gap between expectations and actual experiences calls\nfor investigations of the underlying reasons for energy and water consumption. Practice theories can\nhelp to formulate and address relevant research questions, as they place smart meters in the context of\neveryday practices [12].\nBoth energy and water consumption are embedded in everyday practices such as cooking,\nlaundering, cleaning or showering [30]. Energy and water consumption are not practices in themselves\nbut rather a by-product, \u2018just what happens while going about our daily lives\u2019 [31]. Following\nthis line of thinking, a focus on practices helps to extend the scope from flows of resources to the\nmeaningful activities they enable. In this paper we explore the challenges and potentials related to the\ninteraction between residents and smart meters through the lens of social practice theories. This leads\nto a discussion on what smart metering can and cannot do in contributing to energy transitions.\nThe questions guiding our analysis are:\n\u2022 What challenges and potentials related to smart meter feedback have been identified?\n\u2022 How can the identified challenges and potentials be analysed and reframed through theories of\nsocial practice?\n\u2022 Can smart meter feedback support energy transitions?\n169\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3553\nOur conceptual approach is based on practice theories, e.g., Reference [32], implying that patterns\nof energy and water consumption change when links between the elements of energy and water\nconsuming practices are broken or created. We review key literature on smart metering trials where\nattention has been paid to the interaction between residents and smart meters, in order to explore the\nchallenges and potentials related to smart meter feedback.\nThe paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we first introduce our conceptual approach to\nsmart metering, after which our data and methods are described in Section 3. In Section 4 we present\nresults from the reviewed literature and a survey we have conducted, identifying challenges and\npotentials for effective smart metering and interpreting these based on practice theories. Section 5\nreflects on the results in the light of practice theories and discusses whether smart metering could\ncontribute to energy transitions. Section 6 summarises key findings and gives recommendations for\nthe development of smart meter feedback.\n2. Conceptual Approach\nSmart meter feedback is assumed to make rational consumers alter their behaviour in response\nto information about their consumption (and the related costs). This assumption has in recent years\nbeen challenged by some researchers, and more critical approaches to smart metering have been\nexpressed. Yolande Strengers [12] (p. 2) argues that the global vision for smart energy technologies is\npart of a \u2018Smart Utopia\u2019 that is underpinned by a smart ontology, in which human action and social\nchange are understood as being mediated by information and communication technology (ICT) and\ndata. In a Smart Utopia, environmental problems are solved with the help of new technology without\ncompromising current lifestyle. In this vision, technologies, such as smart meters, act in various\nroles: They promise rational and efficient control of residents, they assign responsibility for complex\nenvironmental problems to individuals rather than states or companies and they \u2018seamlessly manage\nthe home environment while maintaining or enhancing current lifestyle expectations\u2019 [12] (p. 8, 23).\nThis vision is based on viewing residents as highly informed and rational micro-resource managers\nof energy (and water), who are interested in their own consumption and manage it with the help of\nsmart meter feedback. The concept of \u2018Resource Man\u2019 has been introduced to describe this type of an\nideal energy consumer that smart metering projects are targeted at. \u2018Resource Man\u2019 is described as a\n\u2018gendered, technologically minded, information-oriented and economically rational consumer of the\nSmart Utopia\u2019 [12] (pp. 36, 54).\nIn contrast to the smart ontology, Strengers [12] uses the ontology of everyday practice, in which\n\u2018human action and social change is mediated by and through participation in routinely performed\npractices\u2019. Energy and water are not valuable in themselves, but they are merely \u2018ingredients\u2019 [30] or\n\u2018resources\u2019 [33] that enable domestic practices, but operate in the background without the resident\npaying attention to them. When smart meter feedback concentrates solely on energy or water\nas commodities, measured in kWhs or litres, it ignores the role of practices in which they are\nconsumed [12].\nThese ideas belong to an increasing body of literature on theories of social practice. Practice\ntheories build on the works of e.g., Giddens [34] and have been developed further by e.g., Schatzki [35],\nReckwitz [36] and Shove et al. [32]. As interpretations of the practice approach vary between scholars,\nthe theory is often referred to in plural [32], as we also do in our paper. In practice theories, the unit of\nanalysis and enquiry is social practice, which has been defined as a \u2018routinised type of behaviour\u2019 [36]\n(p. 249), which \u2018endures between and across specific moments of enactment\u2019 [37]. Practices consist\nof three elements: Materials, competences and meanings. Materials include all tangible objects,\ninfrastructure and technologies, competences include skills, know-how and technique, and meanings\nencompass ideas, aspirations and symbolic meanings [32]. A practice exists simultaneously as a\nperformance and as an entity [36] (p. 249), [32]. Practice as a performance is the observable behaviour\nof individuals, such as heating or cooling spaces, cooking or showering. However, when practices are\nunderstood as entities, it becomes clear that the observable behaviour (practice as performance) is not a\n170\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3553\nresult of individual choices but by nature social, embedded in socially shared ideas and meanings. Seen\nin this way, the observable behaviour of individuals is only the \u2018tip of the iceberg\u2019 [38], underpinned\nby socially shared elements of practice: Competences, materials and meanings. Examples of this\nanalytical distinction are described in Table 1.\nTable 1. Elements of practice as an entity. Adapted from [38].\nObservable Behaviour of Individuals (Practice as Performance):\ne.g., Heating or Cooling Spaces, Cooking, Showering, Watching TV etc.\nSkills and Competences Materials and Infrastructure\nSocially Shared Meanings\nand Conventions\n(Embodied) knowledge and\nskills needed to perform\npractices, knowing how to use\nappliances, timing and ordering\nof activities etc.\nConstant availability of heat,\nelectricity and hot water, showers\ninstalled in bathrooms, ovens in\nkitchens, availability of a TV\nIdeas of \u2019normality\u2019, ideas of\ncomfort, socially accepted ways of\ne.g., eating and levels of\ncleanliness\nEach practice-as-entity has its history and a trajectory along which it develops. A process\nof co-evolution happens between technologies and infrastructures, competences and meanings\nthat together constitute a practice. The development paths of practices illustrate how normality\nis constructed and how unsustainability can become standardised. When certain expectations of\ncomfort, cleanliness and convenience have become standardised, in terms of what is regarded as\n\u2018normal\u2019, patterns of consumption may escalate as what previously was regarded as \u2018luxury\u2019 gradually\nbecomes \u2018normal\u2019. These developments have led to more energy-intensive lifestyles [39]. For example,\nair-conditioning has become normalised in many countries, making passive thermal design in buildings\nmore rare [39]. An example related to water consumption is how the frequency of washing bodies and\nclothes has increased, rendering daily showering and frequent laundering normal practices and thus\nincreasing water consumption [40,41].\nPractices are, on the one hand, relatively stable and to an extent resist change, which emphasises\ntheir path-dependent character. On the other hand, people, when performing practices, also create\npossibilities for change by experimenting, adapting and improvising. Even though there is individual\nvariation between performing a practice, practices are social by character and individuals participating\nin them seek recognition as competent practitioners by performing practices well, according to\nthe shared standards and understandings of normality, which vary between social groups and\ngeographical contexts [42]. The importance of communities for developing low-carbon ways of living\nand challenging conventions has been recognised in previous research. Communities hold potential\nthat individuals alone do not have [43].\nPractice theoretical approaches differ from research focusing on individuals as active\ndecision-makers, which is often presumed in consumption feedback studies. Approaches focusing on\nindividuals see behaviour as a set of choices determined by identifiable factors, including attitudes\nand values and have been described as the \u2018ABC paradigm\u2019, A standing for attitude, B for behaviour\nand C for choice [44]. This paradigm draws on economic theories and psychology, for example on the\ntheory of planned behaviour [45]. In the language of the ABC, there are barriers and motivators for\nindividuals to change their behaviour, and the role of policy is to remove those barriers and persuade\nindividuals to make sustainable choices [32]. The distinction between the two approaches is illustrated\nin Figure 1a,b. In Figure 1a, residents are presented as rational managers of resources. In Figure 1b,\nresidents are practitioners taking part in social practices, each of which consists of the interlinked\nelements of competences, materials and meanings. Practices are sequenced and linked with each other\nin time and space. They may also overlap in timing, location and elements. Consumption of resources\nsuch as energy and water is an integrated part of practices but is essentially instrumental rather than\nan end in itself.\n171\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3553\n(a) \n(b) \nFigure 1. (a). Smart meter feedback according to the ABC paradigm; (b). Smart meter feedback in the\ncontext of everyday social practices.\nDespite the criticism of smart metering and rational optimisation of energy consumption,\nthere have also been attempts to see if and how smart metering could become a more integrated\nelement of different practices contributing to energy transition. It has been suggested that smart\nsystems, including smart metering, could be an element in potentially emerging home energy\nmanagement (HEM) practices involving energy monitoring, microgeneration, energy storage, energy\ntrading/sharing, timing of demand and energy conservation, which are being promoted by smart grid\ndevelopment [46].\nHEM-practices could support energy transitions, and three orders of sociotechnical innovation\nrelated to energy transitions have been suggested. The orders differ in terms of the level of integration\nbetween domestic consumption practices and HEM-practices [46]. The first order innovations do\nnot change the basic set-up of the household and its connection with the wider energy system,\nand do not connect domestic consumption practices with HEM-practices. Examples include using\n172\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3553\nan in-home energy display to monitor consumption or substitution of old appliances with more\nenergy efficient ones. In second order innovations there is a stronger connection between HEM\nand domestic consumption practices, as well as the wider energy systems, e.g., timing of laundry\nor vacuuming practices to fit local energy production in order to de-link consumption from carbon\nintensive production and distribution practices [46]. Third order innovations present a more radical\ndeparture from the current system, involving increasingly sharing the tasks and responsibilities for\nenergy production and distribution practices between households, existing service providers and\nnew intermediaries (ibid.). Third order innovations can also involve energy self-sufficient districts or\nenergy cooperatives, transferring the power from centralised to de-centralised actors. In one scenario\nhouseholds belong to a personal carbon allowance trading scheme, and some domestic consumption\npractices are no longer private but become shared, e.g., through shared cars and shared laundry\nand cooking facilities [46] (pp. 130\u2013133). For our study, the three orders of innovations provide a\nbenchmark to look at the level of integration of smart meter feedback into practices.\n3. Data and Methods\nWe carried out a literature review and conducted a survey within a sample of European smart\nmetering projects in order to analyse what issues are seen as limiting the effectiveness of smart\nmeter feedback and what issues, on the other hand, are seen as potentials for effective smart meter\nfeedback, within a sample of European smart metering projects. The type of the review is integrative.\nAn integrative literature review has been defined as \u2018a form of research that reviews, critiques and\nsynthesises representative literature on a topic in an integrated way such that new frameworks and\nperspectives on the topic are generated\u2019 [47]. Articles for the literature review were searched in the\nWeb of Science in January 2017, where we restricted the analysis to papers published in the last 10 years\n(between 2007 and 2017). The search was repeated in September 2018 to cover articles published in 2017\nand 2018. Several combinations of keywords were tested, and a search was done with the following\nset of keywords: TS = (Domestic OR household* OR residen* OR consumer*) AND TS = (electric*\nOR energ* OR heat* OR water) AND TS = (meter* OR feedback OR smart) AND TS = (behav* OR\nawareness) AND TS = (conserva* OR sav* OR reduc*).\nWe focused on studies where the main aim has been to affect overall consumption and in some\ncases also load shifting by providing consumption feedback information in the form of a smart meter\ndisplay or similar medium. Our focus is on the challenges and potential of smart meter feedback to\naffect overall energy and water consumption. Thus, we have excluded papers from our review where\nthe focus has been only on load shifting. Most of the available research addresses smart electricity\nmetering, while smart water, heat or gas metering have been studied less. Therefore, most of the articles\nwe have reviewed concentrate on smart electricity metering. However, several domestic practices use\nboth energy and water simultaneously (e.g., laundering, dishwashing, showering). The background\nassumption of smart meter feedback (i.e., provision of consumption data to residents makes them\nreduce their consumption) is the same, regardless of whether the resource is electricity, water, gas\nor heat.\nIn order to better understand the potentials and challenges of smart metering feedback in relation\nto practices, we have limited our analysis to studies that have qualitatively addressed the interaction\nbetween residents and smart meter feedback. Thus, studies that have concentrated on quantitatively\nmeasuring the achieved savings, customer satisfaction of smart meter trials or comparing different\nfeatures of in-home displays and the residents\u2019 preferences regarding the display features but not\naddressing the residents\u2019 experiences in more detail have been excluded, along with studies looking\nat smart metering from the point of view of utility companies, for example its economic profitability.\nAnother requirement was that the trials should enable residents to monitor their consumption and\naccess their consumption data via an in-home display, mobile application or a website. The final sample\nincluded 20 articles, which are listed and briefly described in Appendix A. These articles form our\ncore material. In addition, we use a larger body of literature on smart metering and energy and water\n173\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3553\nfeedback to support our analysis. The reported trial settings vary according to their size, duration,\nwhether the participants volunteered or not, or whether other interventions e.g., energy efficiency\nmeasures were introduced at the same time. In some studies, changes in consumption were measured\nor a quantitative survey accompanied the qualitative analysis, but our focus is on the qualitative data,\nmost of which consists of interviews. Only articles containing new empirical material were included in\nour sample, thus excluding review articles. The analysis is qualitative. We have read through the final\nsample of articles, collected and grouped all the identified challenges and potentials and organised\nthem under the three elements of practice theories (materials, competences and meanings).\nIn addition to the literature review, we use data from an online survey. The survey questions were\nformulated based on an analysis of documents describing metering initiatives in various European\ncountries. Information about these metering projects was collected on the ICLEI (International Council\nfor Local Environmental Initiatives) website in the form of documents and descriptions on metering\nprojects\u2019 websites, as well as with a snowball method from these websites and documents and through\nthe researchers\u2019 contacts. The survey was sent in December 2016 to 39 organisations that have\nimplemented energy and/or water metering trials in Europe. Of these, 11 responded. The responses\ncovered 15 smart metering projects in 10 European countries. The aim of the survey was to gather\ninformation on the barriers and enablers of European metering projects and the role of residents\nin them. The survey contained multiple choice and open-ended questions related to these themes.\nThe results of the survey are used to complement the results of the literature review.\nFrom the literature we have identified challenges and on the other hand, potentials of smart\nmetering in the spheres of competences and skills, materials and infrastructures, and socially shared\nmeanings. We have applied practice theories to reframe these three spheres to assess the possibilities\nto tackle the challenges and harness the potentials.\n4. Results\nIn this section we present our findings on the challenges and potentials identified in the analysed\narticles and the survey. We summarise our findings as described in the literature and in parallel\ninterpret them in the light of the theories of practice presented in Section 2.\nThrough the interpretation we shift perspective from the meters, management and data to\nchallenges and potentials in the light of the everyday practices that people already carry out in order\nto complete meaningful tasks. We link the observations from the survey with those reported in the\nreviewed literature to identify supporting or conflicting findings.\n4.1. Challenges Related to Smart Meter Feedback\nIn Tables 2\u20134, we summarise the challenges of smart metering as identified in the literature\nand interpret the observations from a practice theories perspective. The challenges are grouped into\nthe three categories of practice elements: Competences and skills, materials and infrastructures and\nsocially shared meanings.\n4.1.1. Challenges Related to Competences and Skills\nFirst, we look at what in the practice terminology is referred to as competences and skills (Table 2).\nIn the literature, insufficient knowledge and inactivity of residents is often referred to as hindering\nenergy or water saving.\n174\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3553\nTable 2. Challenges of smart meter feedback related to competences and skills as identified in the\nliterature and as interpreted through theories of social practice.\nChallenges of Smart Metering Feedback Related to Competences and Skills\nIdentified in the literature Interpreted through theories of practice\nResidents\u2019 knowledge on energy or water\nconsumption is insufficient. Smart meter feedback is\nperceived as too complicated and abstract by\nresidents in general [27,48\u201353], and by the elderly\npopulation in particular [48]. Residents are not\ninterested in monitoring their\nconsumption [27,48\u201351].\nCompetence and skills that save energy or water are\ncurrently not integral to the practices where energy and\nwater are used. Understanding energy or water use at\nan abstract level is not relevant for the performance of\ndomestic practices.\nAfter an initial interest in the new \u2018gadget\u2019 and\nplaying with it, smart meters tend to get\n\u2018backgrounded\u2019 and forgotten [31,51,54\u201357].\nSmart meters do not manage to successfully connect to\nexisting practices where energy and water are used and\nremain isolated from them. They do not support or\nstrengthen competences that would use less energy or\nwater. Thus, they are rarely able to change the practices.\nResidents do not know how to further save energy or\nwater. Smart meters do not provide any assistance\nwith how to actually organise daily activities in a way\nthat would save energy and water. [47,50,51]\nFrom a practice perspective, the observation on the lack\nof assistance to organise daily activities is valuable.\nCompetences related to energy or water saving cannot\nbe built simply by providing consumption feedback.\nLack of knowledge and interest among residents was also seen as a challenge to the effectiveness\nof smart meter feedback by nearly all the respondents of our survey, and residents were characterised\nas apathetic and uninterested. Within this kind of problem-framing (residents are not interested,\nthey quickly lose interest) attempts to improve the effectiveness of the intervention are typically\nreduced to making the feedback more salient and diverse by adding more features to it in order to\nprevent the residents from losing their interest, e.g., [56]. This is in line with Figure 1a, a simple\nfeedback loop where information directly affects the way resources are used. From a point of view of\npractice theories, the impact of information provision efforts on the way energy and water are used\ncan be questioned. The challenge identified in the literature is that residents do not (know how to)\nuse the meter and data in their daily lives. Practice framing would turn the problem around: People\nalready have knowledge and skills to go on with their everyday activities but lack knowledge and\nskills to embed and translate feedback from the meters to transform the way they perform practices.\nThe elderly has been recognised as a group that faces special challenges in engaging with smart meter\nfeedback [48].\n4.1.2. Challenges Related to Materials and Infrastructures\nAccess to unlimited volume of energy and (hot) water, and appliances to assist in housekeeping\nand cleanliness form an important material element of daily energy and water consuming practices.\nThe material elements have evolved over time, at the same time shaping domestic practices and\nchanging our perceptions about standards of cleanliness and comfort. Smart meter feedback always\ntakes place in a material context, which may sustain energy and water intensive practices and thus\npose a challenge for the effectiveness of smart meter feedback (Table 3).\n175\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3553\nTable 3. Challenges of smart meter feedback related to materials and infrastructures as identified in\nthe literature and as interpreted through theories of social practice.\nChallenges of Smart Meter Feedback Related to Materials and Infrastructures\nIdentified in the literature Interpreted through theories of practice\nTechnical problems related to the installation and\nfunctioning of smart meters, e.g., reception issues or\nsensor faults [27,52,56,58,59].\nThese observations do not relate to any material\nelements of existing practices but rather highlight\nthe material essence of the meter itself. Technical\nproblems are associated with reliability and can\nform an obstacle for smart meters to become a\nmaterial element of practices as intended.\nHousing developers, local authorities and manufacturers of\nappliances create hindrances to making use of smart meter\nfeedback and thus energy saving, for example by making the\ninstallation of heat pumps or micro-generation of renewable\nenergy difficult or not being proactive about energy efficiency\nin the design of new buildings and appliances [55,60].\nThe material elements underlying current energy\nand water consuming practices are often complex\nand expensive and therefore slowly replaced.\nAlthough energy efficiency has become a selling\npoint, the material elements do not address the\nrebound effect related to increased use.\nThe results of our survey are to a large extent in line with the results of the literature review\nregarding material elements. However, various technical problems were represented in our survey as\nthe most important factor limiting the effectiveness of smart metering, while in the reviewed literature\ntechnical issues were rather rarely mentioned. This underlines that a functioning technology is crucial\nfor smart metering [61], which in itself is not surprising, but may obscure the important interactions\nbetween technologies and practice. Although a functioning technology is a prerequisite for the smart\nsystem to be integrated into practices, technically viable solutions do not guarantee that the technology\nwill become part of relevant practices. The metering projects aimed at providing material elements\nfor consumers with an objective to encourage them to come up with practices to manage resource\nconsumption. However, what seems to be missing is a link between the new material component\nand other elements of existing practices. Our findings from the review and the survey support the\nnotion that the elements of practices and links between them need to change in a consistent way in\norder to increase the likelihood of achieving the final goal: more sustainable patterns of resources use\n(Figure 1b).\nOther, nearly as important limiting factors recognised in the survey were the residents\u2019 low\ninterest in their energy and water consumption and habits and culture regarding energy and water\nconsumption. From a practice perspective, it is interesting that one respondent highlighted how\ncustomers were only interested in data when it was related to specific events. A practice interpretation\nof the low interest emphasises the instrumental and invisible role of the flows of energy and water in\nconducting meaningful practices.\nA third finding from our survey regarding the materiality of the smart meter is that in the trials\nthat responded to it, the most common means to access the information was via a website. This is\nrather disconnected from the actual practices that consume water and energy. Based on the objectives\nof the projects and the focus on metering, many projects aimed at introducing new practices of\nmanaging energy, but these did not often realise as intended. The survey responses indicate that\nparallel measures to support users and provide financial incentives would be needed to support the\nresidents\u2019 engagement with consumption data more actively. Our interpretation is that if the objective\nis to introduce new practices of managing energy in households, the practice approach would be\nuseful in mapping the elements of practice that need to be reconfigured instead of simply focusing on\nintroducing a specific technology (Figure 1b).\n4.1.3. Challenges Related to Socially Shared Meanings\nThe third category of challenges is related to socially shared meanings (Table 4). The literature\nhighlights numerous observations related to the taken-for-granted levels of comfort that are difficult\nto challenge.\n176\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3553\nTable 4. Challenges of smart meter feedback related to socially shared meanings as identified in the\nliterature and as interpreted through theories of social practice.\nChallenges of Smart Meter Feedback Related to Socially Shared Meanings\nIdentified in the Literature Interpreted through Theories of Practice\nResidents are not willing to compromise certain\nliving standards and to reduce their consumption.\nCertain appliances and perceived levels of comfort\nare not negotiable and residents receiving smart\nmeter feedback become defensive about\nthem [27,51,55,56,58,60,62,63].\nMeanings of comfort and normality are integral to\nmany practices where energy and water are\nconsumed. Rather than focusing on individuals and\ntheir feelings, practice theories try to understand the\ntrajectory of socially shared meanings related to those\nmundane domestic practices where energy and water\nare consumed. By examining how these meanings\nhave developed over time, how they are currently\nsustained and how they are changing, insights can be\ngained that help to identify paths to more\nsustainable practices.\nSmart meter feedback only appeals to a small group\nof \u2018monitor enthusiasts\u2019 who are already interested in\nfollowing their energy consumption, leaving the large\naudience unaffected [27,56,58].\nThese \u2018monitor enthusiasts\u2019 can be seen as the early\nadopters of a practice of energy monitoring. Whether\nthis practice manages to recruit larger groups of\npractitioners depends on the broader context where\ndomestic energy and water consuming practices\ntake place.\nUnequal participation of household members. Smart\nmetering projects have often appealed to the\ntechnically minded, typically male members of\nhouseholds, leaving other family members more\npassive [27,31,52\u201355,57,60,63\u201365].\nPatterns of inequality and power are present in\npractices, as well as shared conventions, roles and\nresponsibilities related to e.g., gender and age within\nhouseholds. These are reflected in the way smart\nmeter feedback is received and used in households.\nSmart meter feedback can serve as a \u2018normaliser\u2019 of\nconsumption, as residents receiving smart meter\nfeedback quickly develop a sense of their usual level\nof consumption. Smart meter feedback helps to\nidentify abnormal, excess use and \u2018waste\u2019, at the same\ntime legitimising certain basic level of consumption\n[27,52,57,59,60,64].\nResidents see themselves as energy or water efficient\nand do not see how they could further save energy or\nwater [27,31,50,52\u201354,58,59].\nMeanings of normality are important in\nunderstanding how certain practices become\nestablished as part of everyday life. Smart meter\nfeedback is not capable of challenging meanings of\nnormality. Rather, it may serve to confirm what is\nalready regarded as normal.\nPurposeful \u2018wasting\u2019 of energy and water is not part\nof practices, but the \u2018normality\u2019 of practices hides\nresource intensive ways of living that residents do\nnot easily question.\nResidents refer to the importance of health and\nwell-being, especially of children or the elderly, and\nmaintaining harmony in the home. The goal of\nenergy saving is perceived as conflicting with these\naims [27,58,60,63].\nSaving energy is not currently involved as an element\nin domestic practices, while other meanings such as\ncare and well-being especially of children and the\nelderly, belong to the energy-intensive practices of\nheating and cooling.\nResidents have feelings of distrust towards utilities\nand smart meters and are concerned about loss of\nprivacy or autonomy. Smart meters blur the\nboundaries between the private and the external and\nare sometimes hidden from sight by residents who\nfeel they are too visible in the home environment.\nSmart meters cause conflicts between family\nmembers [27,49,53,56,65].\nMeanings of privacy and autonomy that are integral\nto domestic practices are threatened when smart\nmeters presume disclosure of consumption\ninformation vertically (between household and\nutility) or horizontally (between or within\nhouseholds, e.g., between parents and children).\nThere is not enough economic incentive for residents\nto engage with smart meter feedback as the average\nachieved economic savings are too small to motivate\nchanges in daily routines [27,52,55,58,60].\nThese observations reflect a view of residents as\nrational individuals who respond to economic\nincentives by weighing the costs and making\ndecisions based on the smart meter feedback.\nThis assumption is questioned by practice theories.\nHowever, a wider economic context is important for\nhow energy and water consuming practices have\ndeveloped over time and how they will develop in\nthe future.\n177\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3553\nAs seen in the results Tables 2\u20134, the analysed literature has its main focus on individuals, their\nattitudes and feelings, preferences and behaviour. These challenges look different when the focus\nis on the social practices where energy and water are consumed rather than on the individuals that\nconsume. As highlighted in Section 4.1.2. on challenges related to material elements, availability of\nresources and appliances have normalised increasing standards of comfort and cleanliness and as a\nresult also practices have changed. Pure consumption-based feedback may not be powerful enough to\naffect practices if material elements and socially shared meanings remain unchanged (Figure 1b).\nWhen discussing the absence of a supportive policy and market context, theories of social practice\nwould pay attention to the ways policies have shaped and sustained the unsustainable ways of life\nwith high energy and water consumption. The residents\u2019 experience that it is not easy to save money\nwhen trying to save electricity [60] may be well justified. However, the conclusion according to practice\ntheories would not straightforwardly claim that residents need more economic incentives to make\nbetter choices. Pricing of energy and water does play a role in creating meanings of abundancy or\nscarcity, but above a certain minimum level of income the pricing may be less important than the ideas\nof normal levels of comfort, cleanliness and convenience, which have co-evolved with infrastructure,\npolicy and technical development of appliances.\nThe importance of a practice-based perspective is illustrated by the reported observation that\nresidents find the shifting of activities to low-peak periods of the day inconvenient [31,52,63]. This does\nnot clearly relate to only one element of practices, but rather emphasises the role of the organisation\nand sequences of daily activities and the connections between practices. The temporal flexibility of\npractices varies considerably, dining being among the least flexible domestic practices as it is tied to\nbodily rhythms as well as timing of work, study and leisure activities [66].\n4.2. Potentials of Smart Meter Feedback\nIn Tables 5\u20137, we summarise the potentials of smart metering and suggested ways of improving it.\nSimilarly as the challenges in the previous section, the potentials are grouped into the three categories\nof competences and skills, materials and infrastructures and socially shared meanings.\n4.2.1. Potentials Related to Competences and Skills\nPotentials related to competences and skills (Table 5) show that the role of improving the provision\nof information is central in the literature.\nTable 5. Potentials of smart meter feedback related to competences and skills as identified in the\nliterature and as interpreted through theories of social practice.\nPotentials of Smart Meter Feedback Related to Competences and Skills\nIdentified in the literature Interpreted through theories of social practice\nSmart meter feedback functions as a learning tool,\nincreasing the residents\u2019 awareness and\nunderstanding of their energy and water\nconsumption [27,31,50\u201355,57,59,60,63\u201365].\nSmart meter feedback evidently increases knowledge\nof energy and water consumption among (some)\nresidents. However, this increased knowledge does\nnot automatically actualise as reduced consumption,\nbecause consumption results from practices that do\nnot change simply by providing information.\nTailoring smart meter feedback to various user\ngroups and contexts, in order to make consumption\ndata more relevant and interesting [50,56,64,67].\nPaying attention to the variation among individuals\nand social contexts where domestic practices are\nperformed makes feedback less general and can\ncreate a stronger link to specific practices.\nUsing smart meter feedback as an educational aid\nin school projects among children and young\npeople [52,60,67]\nIn these examples smart meter feedback is adopted as\nan element in teaching practices.\n178\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3553\nIn our survey, the importance of choosing simple enough smart metering technology that suits\nthe residents\u2019 needs was emphasised as the most important success factor for smart metering projects.\nThis may reflect the fact that the meter and monitoring activities as such are not important but how\nthese can be embedded in other meaningful practices. In addition, the importance of recognising\nwindows of opportunity to disrupt current patterns of consumption (see also Reference [11]) was\nmentioned in the survey.\nProviding comparative consumption data within a peer group was considered important by most\nrespondents of our survey, while most of the reviewed studies did not address comparative feedback.\nSome researchers have paid attention to the potential \u2018boomerang effects\u2019 of social comparisons, if\nresidents who are defined as \u2018low users\u2019 increase their consumption [28] as the \u201cnormal\u201d level justifies\nhigher consumption. Others [67] note that contextualising feedback by providing social comparisons\nwith the community was experienced positively by most residents participating in the trial but a\nnegative sense of competition was felt by some. There is some indication that co-designing smart\nmeter feedback together with residents can yield higher engagement with the feedback [68]. Smart\nmeter\u2014based gamification of energy and water consumption has also successfully managed to engage\nresidents and resulted in reductions of water consumption in a small trial setting [69]. From a practice\ntheories approach this could be seen as recruiting individuals to a practice of playing a game, which,\nwhen played by its rules, results in reduced water consumption. Practice theories would also invite us\nto focus on how smart meter feedback is embedded in the current arrangement of elements of practice,\nnot only on interactions of metering feedback and the user.\nFrom a practice perspective tailoring feedback makes sense in that the contexts in which practices\ntake place vary in terms of materials, competences and meanings, and there is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019\nsolution that would work in all contexts [70]. Also, if tailoring involves interaction with intermediaries,\nsuch as energy advisers, it is more likely to build competences that can engender concrete changes in\nenergy-using practices. The potential of intermediaries for building competences in low-carbon ways\nof living has been recognised in previous studies, e.g., Reference [71]. There is also some indication\nthat targeting particular practices such as showering, (via separate smart meter displays next to the\nshower) [72] or heating (measuring gas consumption with a smart meter and providing tailored, user-\nand building specific advice to lower room temperatures through an in-home display) [73], may be\nsuccessful in decreasing the resource consumption in these practices. From a practice theories point of\nview, this creates a stronger link to certain practices than providing information on (inconspicuous)\nenergy or water consumption in general, which results from various domestic practices that are not\nalways easily separable from each other.\n4.2.2. Potentials Related to Materials and Infrastructures\nSmart meter feedback happens in a material context, which consists of the built infrastructure,\nresource flows and appliances of the household. Currently, these are often unsupportive of low-carbon\nways of living. Thus, only few potentials related to the material context were identified in the literature\n(Table 6).\nCombining smart meter feedback with microgeneration can be seen not only as creating\nnew material elements to practices but also to the competences and meanings associated with\ndomestic energy-using practices. Only four of the studies we analysed included households that\nwere micro-producers of solar power. Microgeneration provides potentially an entry point to a\nradically different relationship to energy [46] (p. 90), as confirmed by two of the studies in our\nsample [52,62], in which some households with smart metering and photovoltaic panel installed\nadapted their domestic practices to match the solar peak periods. An analogy with farming was\npresented by a participant, referring to not wanting to waste the \u2018crops\u2019 one produces [62]. Meanings\nof self-sufficiency have in some trials also been found to be an important part of prosumerism [74].\nIt has been observed that becoming a prosumer requires certain competences that are evolving over\n179\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3553\ntime and requires integrating \u2018home grown\u2019 energy in everyday practices [70]. However, in two of the\nreviewed studies [31,63], similar impacts were not observed.\nTable 6. Potentials of smart meter feedback related to materials and infrastructures as identified in the\nliterature and as interpreted through theories of social practice.\nPotentials of Smart Meter Feedback Related to Materials and Infrastructures\nIdentified in the Literature Interpreted through Theories of Social Practice\nLinking engagement with smart meter\nfeedback to an existing activity such as\nwatching TV [65].\nPractice theories may help to explain why in one study,\nwhere smart meter feedback could be viewed on TV,\nit became the most popular medium of engaging with it.\nIt was connected to an existing practice and its material\nelement (TV) and associated with commercial breaks.\nSmart meter feedback combined with\nmicrogeneration of solar energy can engender\nchanges in the way energy is used [31,52,62].\nParticipating in the production of intermittent solar energy\ncan change the configuration and rhythm of certain\npractices by reconfiguring the meaning of energy in\ndomestic practices as something that is temporally limited.\nThe above mentioned examples indicate that micro-generation, when used as a complementary\nsource of energy and still having a constant and reliable access to centralised power grid, does\nnot necessarily challenge existing practices and energy intensive ways of life, while the situation is\ncompletely different for practitioners \u2018off-the-grid\u2019, who have to organise their practices and daily\nrhythms based on the availability of energy [12] (pp. 135\u2013154)). The different responses by households\nin the reviewed literature are of interest as all households in the studies we reviewed were connected\nto the centralised grid. The reasons for successes (or failures) are beyond our study but would be a\ntopic to address in future research.\n4.2.3. Potentials Related to Socially Shared Meanings\nSocially and culturally shared meanings and conventions are deeply embedded in and shape the\npractices using energy and water. Potentials related to shared meanings that have been identified in\nour sample of reviewed studies are presented in Table 7.\nCommunities hold potential for shaping practices towards a more sustainable direction\nthrough experimentation and peer learning. The way knowledge is shared and becomes part\nof practices for example among frontrunner households that experiment with sustainable energy\ntechnologies, includes interaction with peers, home visits and conversations face to face or in online\ncommunities [9\u201311]. This is very different from most of the reviewed literature where individuals\nor families receive abstract consumption information that is not shared with others, or sharing of it\nis not meaningful as it is not linked to any other activities of the community (if there even is one).\nHowever, some of the analysed studies recognise the potential of supporting communities in feedback\nexperiments [31,67]. It can also be argued that \u2018frontrunner\u2019 households experimenting with smart\nmeter feedback and presenting the monitoring systems to their peers serve to promote a potentially\nemerging practice of energy monitoring [46].\nSeveral of the reviewed studies argue that smart meter feedback should look beyond individuals\nand instead focus on and try to understand household dynamics and the community context in which\nfeedback is received [49,51,55,60,63\u201365,67]. One of the studies [60] also suggest that providing smart\nmeters to households as part of broader collective efforts and partnerships on energy conservation\ncould make a difference regarding how actively residents engage in using them. In our survey, one of\nthe key issues identified for the effectiveness of smart metering was linking smart metering to other\nenergy or water saving actions such as energy coaching or awareness raising campaigns.\n180\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3553\nTable 7. Potentials of smart meter feedback related to socially shared meanings as identified in the\nliterature and as interpreted through theories of social practice.\nPotentials of Smart Meter Feedback Related to Socially Shared Meanings\nIdentified in the Literature Interpreted through Theories of Practice\nCombining smart meter feedback with community-level\naction on energy or water conservation, such as\nworkshops and group discussions [51,67].\nResidents taking part in smart meter feedback trials\nfeeling proud of the system and presenting it to their\npeers, which can have potential spillover effects outside\nthe household [52,53,60,65].\nSocial networks such as communities are\nimportant for the diffusion of practices. Thus,\ncommunity-level activities together with smart\nmeter trials may help to create and support a\ncommunity of practice, in which social learning\ntakes place, ideas are shared, and utilising smart\nmeter feedback could take root as a practice.\nSmart meter feedback playing other roles and attaining\nother meanings than the management of energy or water\nconsumption: source of reassurance when being able to\npredict the size of the next bill, a tool for controlling\nfamily members, providing security and maintaining\nsense of togetherness between family members who are\nlocated separately or a tool for detecting failures, leaks,\nincorrect billing or underperformance of\nPV-panels [52,59,60,63,64].\nMeanings attached to certain elements of\npractices are always on the move and their\ndevelopment is to some extent unpredictable.\nSmart meters, when entering household\ncontexts, are likely to attain other meanings\nthan those originally intended. This may affect\nconsumption negatively or positively. For\nexample, using smart meter feedback to detect\nsystem failures and thus improving the\nperformance of e.g., PV-panels decreases the\nclimate impacts of a household even if did not\naffect the ways energy is actually consumed.\nSocial networks such as communities are important for the diffusion of practices, and it is\nalso within these that practices can change [32]. Building trust and establishing a community\npartnership based on social, face-to-face interaction in the community e.g., in the form of home\nenergy assessments have been recognised as key success factors in some community-based energy\ninterventions [75,76]. Personal contacts with intermediaries have been linked to better effectiveness of\nfeedback interventions [77]. In the light of practice theories, community-level activities could also be\nintegrated into smart meter feedback initiatives, as they would help to create and support a community\nof practice in which social learning takes place, ideas are shared and utilising smart meter feedback\ncould take hold as a practice, which would provide peer-support and help to build new competences.\nHowever, this does not happen automatically and belonging to a certain geographic community or\nneighbourhood is not necessarily enough for a community of practice to emerge [78].\nSome of the reviewed studies [55,57] call for policies and smart metering strategies that would\nchallenge what is seen as \u2018normal\u2019 everyday consumption, by using existing policy techniques to\nsupport low-carbon social practices and even experimenting with radical policy measures such as\npersonal carbon allowances [55]. It has been suggested that smart meter feedback could, instead of\nproviding only consumption data, concentrate on the meanings and competences associated with\ncertain practices and give advice on how they could be performed differently [57]. These suggestions\nresonate with practice theories, as they would radically shape the meanings and competences related\nto energy and water consuming practices. However, these suggestions should be further developed\nand empirically studied in order to find out their potential in a real-life setting.\n5. Discussion\nThis paper is an attempt to look at smart meter feedback and the challenges and potentials\nassociated with it from the point of view of practice theories. One guiding question in practice theories\nwhen looking at energy use is \u2018What is energy for?\u2019 [30]. As the behaviour change paradigm \u2018ABC\u2019\nand practice theories ask different questions, interpreting the challenges and potentials of smart\nmetering from a point of view of practice theories is not a straightforward task. Based on our analysis\nit seems that it is especially fruitful to use practice theories to reframe challenges that are usually seen\n181\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3553\nas individuals\u2019 lack of interest or knowledge or their love of comfort. When these are not framed\nas characteristics of the individuals but understood as being integral parts of normalised, socially\nshared practices that are shaped by the material arrangements of our everyday environments, new\nopportunities for intervention can emerge.\nAttempts to affect the \u2018tip of the iceberg\u2019, the observable behaviour of individuals (see Section 1)\nwithout recognising the material features, competences and shared understandings that underpin\nvisible behaviour, miss an opportunity to shape the elements of which practices are made and thus\naffect their sustainability in the long term. Smart meter feedback attempts to improve the efficiency\nof the \u2018performance\u2019 of various practices and in this it has sometimes succeeded. Some residents\ndo reduce \u2018excess\u2019 consumption of energy and water at least in the initial phase of smart metering\ntrials. Residents taking part in smart meter feedback trials typically describe undertaking various\n\u2018curtailment\u2019 behaviours such as turning off lights or appliances that are not in use (e.g., [52,53,57]).\nHowever, it seems that this does not contribute to the sustainability of energy and water consuming\npractices as a whole, the practices as entities. On the contrary, several developments within homes are\npointing towards more energy-intensive ways of life [12,39], and various smart technologies may even\nreinforce this trend [79,80].\nSmart metering and other smart home appliances are often marketed to consumers as a way of\nmanaging resource use without compromising certain lifestyle or level of comfort [12] (p. 26). Smart\nmeter feedback and its sustainability should be viewed and evaluated as part of a wider development\nwhere ICT has an increasing role in various domestic practices [81]. Homes are becoming equipped\nwith smart appliances and home-automation. Smart meter feedback systems are also becoming more\ndeveloped and complex, integrating many kinds of data, e.g., Reference [82]. Attention has been paid\nto the possible drawbacks of smart home technologies, as they could create new energy-demanding\npractices, and new expectations of normality related to comfort, convenience, entertainment, security\nand health may rise as a result of increasing smart features in homes [80,83,84]. The escalating character\nof such expectations is also of concern [39]. Many smart meter feedback devices are marketed and\nused together with other smart home features which have several functions, energy management\nbeing only one of them, and not necessarily the most important one for residents or marketers of these\nsystems [79].\nAs argued earlier in this paper, the assumption of residents being rational individuals that actively\nmake decisions based on smart meter feedback is strongly built in smart meter feedback initiatives.\nThe examples described in the reviewed literature can be interpreted in a way that the idealised energy\nconsumer is to some extent present in the smart meter trials, appealing to few, perhaps technologically\nenthusiastic members of a household. The \u2018Resource Man\u2019 is very similar to the description of an active\nenergy citizen, whose emergence seems to be a precondition but not a guarantee for the effectiveness\nof smart meter feedback and for participating in smart grids. This is very far from the everyday reality\nof how energy and water consumption is an unconscious and embedded part of our everyday living.\nIf the unit of change is social practice rather than individual choice as theories of social practice\nsuggest, interventions based on the emergence of active energy citizens or \u2018Resource Men\u2019 cannot\nachieve a true transition. However, it has been recognised that community energy schemes involving\nmicrogeneration may be able to change the residents\u2019 relationship to energy by making it more\nsalient. Thus, for residents who produce energy through microgeneration and consume it, energy\ncan become an active component in their practices, instead of something that is taken for granted.\nIt has been argued that microgeneration or community energy schemes should be an essential part of\nintroducing smart meters and that without them rollouts of smart meters are \u2018likely to be a missed\nopportunity\u2019 [8]. On the other hand, engagement does not happen automatically, as observed in\nSection 4.2.2, and conventional smart meter feedback may not even serve the needs of prosumers [85].\nMembers of energy cooperatives have been reported to quickly lose interest in engaging with the\nfeedback and finding it difficult to shift activities to the solar peak periods of the day [31]. This brings\nus back to the importance of looking at practices rather than individuals. If the interlinked and\n182\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3553\nsequenced practices where energy and water are used are not temporally flexible enough and if their\ncompetences do not relate to the conservation of energy and water, simply introducing consumption\nfeedback is not enough.\nAn analysis of the ongoing implementation of the UK smart meter roll-out programme\nhas identified barriers related to technology, vulnerability and resistance and given policy\nrecommendations to overcome these barriers. The recommendations include, among others, early\nengagement with residents, recognising lack of trust and concerns over security and privacy, assessing\nhow smart meters connect with prosumption, assessing how smart metering affects vulnerable groups\nand conducting lifecycle analysis on smart meters [61].\nThe policy recommendations [61] are likely to improve the technical reliability, transparency and\nacceptability of the smart meter roll-out as a project, as well as its environmental sustainability.\nHowever, they do not question the effectiveness of smart meter feedback as such. The third\nrecommendation (assessing how smart meters connect with prosumption) may be crucial for the\nfuture effectiveness of smart metering, as microgeneration has potential for making energy a more\nimportant element in the practices where it is used.\nA shift towards low-carbon ways of living does not necessarily require feedback but\nmore fundamental changes in the socio-technical system of energy provision and consumption.\nThis transition is not only a technical matter but is likely to deeply affect our society and culture [86].\nExamples in the literature we have analysed belong almost solely to the category of early first order\ninnovations [46] (see Section 2), while second and third order innovations are almost totally missing,\nwith the exception of some examples where the timing of domestic practices had been adapted as\na result of microgeneration of solar energy [52,62]. It could be argued that in order for smart meter\nfeedback to be effective, it should be implemented only in a context where second and third order\ninnovations are supported, advancing a wider transition towards low-carbon energy systems. There is\nnot one straightforward and easy way to make practice-based policy. Rather, policy based on an\nunderstanding of practice as a unit of change instead of an individual, can take many forms and\nutilise many currently existing policy instruments. However, the fundamental difference is that\npractice-based policymaking is not targeted at persuading individuals to change their behaviour as a\nresult of incentives or information but rather creating conditions for more sustainable practices to take\nhold and recruit practitioners from less sustainable ones [32]. An important first step is to build an\nunderstanding of practices as a unit of societal change.\n6. Conclusions\nSmart metering technologies are politically popular and there is confidence in their role in\nreducing consumption. However, there is also a growing body of literature challenging the assumption\nthat making energy or water consumption data visible or accessible will make residents use energy\nand water differently.\nChallenges of smart meter feedback are to a great extent related to the resource-intensity of current\ndomestic practices, including all their elements: infrastructures and appliances, competences and skills\nas well as shared meanings. Practices do change, but they cannot be changed simply by providing\nconsumption feedback to residents. Energy and water are generally not featuring as elements in\ndomestic practices but operating in the background and taken for granted in current provision systems.\nThis is why residents are generally not interested in monitoring their consumption and why feedback\noften seems abstract and irrelevant to them and makes them defensive. To change this will require\na transition where saving energy starts to matter, e.g. through increasing competences related to\nmicrogeneration and energy communities. At the same time, expectations of normality when it comes\nto standards of living, comfort and cleanliness, should change towards directions that are less energy\nintensive. This requires policies that address practices rather than individuals.\nSmart meter feedback has managed to successfully engage some residents who are experimenting\nwith energy or water management. They can be seen as pioneers of an emerging \u2018home energy\n183\nSustainability 2018, 10, 3553\nmanagement (HEM) practice\u2019. Whether this practice will successfully recruit more practitioners and\neventually have an effect on energy consumption will depend on several developments within energy\nprovision and the role of energy and water in domestic practices. By itself, monitoring is not enough if\nit does not lead to any or more than minor decreases in consumption.\nMonitoring and data collection are increasingly becoming an element of various practices as a\nresult of digitalisation and development of monitoring technologies. For example, monitoring body\nfunctions and physical performance has become more popular as part of exercise routines and fostering\nwell-being. It could be argued that as monitoring gains ground in different spheres, it can also become\npart of domestic energy and water using practices. However, there is a risk that efficiency gains from\nhome energy management will not keep up with the increasing levels of consumption due to rising\nstandards and expectations that come along with the increasing smartness of home environments.\nResearchers have an important role to play in contributing to the discussion around smart\nmetering and how it is framed. Is it a project to activate individuals to make informed choices when\nusing energy and water? Or could it be a project to transform the meanings related to energy and water\nconsuming practices, together with an ongoing, (though still in its initial phase) transition towards a\nde-centralised renewable energy supply system?\nWe argue that in order to increase the impact of smart meter feedback, it should be developed as\nan embedded part of the practice arrangements, not as a stand-alone technological solution to measure\nresource consumption in households. Its relevance for energy and water using practices could be\nimproved by combining it with microgeneration, thus creating an opportunity for energy-monitoring\npractices to emerge and become more established. This would require simultaneously supporting a\nwider energy transition towards a low-carbon society, involving second and third order innovations\nthat would create a link between current domestic practices and currently non-existent HEM-practices.\nParticipatory, household or community-level approaches with active involvement of intermediaries\ncan also support the building of new competences and meanings related to the use of smart meter\nfeedback in performing domestic practices. At the same time, material trends in home environments\nand domestic practices that have implications on what is regarded as normal standard of living should\nbe carefully monitored and their links to policy identified.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualisation, M.H.; H.M.; K.M.; J.P.; M.S. methodology, M.H.; H.M.; J.P.; M.S. formal\nanalysis, H.M.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, H.M.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.H.; H.M.; K.M.; J.P.;\nM.S. supervision, M.H. funding acquisition, M.H.; J.P.\nFunding: This research was funded by the Academy of Finland Strategic Research Council, project Dwellers in\nAgile Cities (DAC), grant number 303481.

Introduction\nDespite the ever increasing economic development attained by the world, many challenges are\nbeing faced in context of environmental inefficiency, environmental pollution, etc. With the passage of\ntime, energy demand rises and infrastructure needs to be upgraded. Therefore, new power grid is\nrequired, that enhances power supply as well as it integrates renewable energy resources. In order to\novercome such challenges, Smart Grid (SG) is brought to the light [1\u20134]. Demand Response (DR) is a\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2763; doi:10.3390/su11102763 www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability190\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2763\ncrucial component of SG technology that tends to maintain the balance among electricity supply and\ndemand using peak load shaving [5]. Real Time Pricing (RTP) is an efficient mechanism among all\nthe schemes that are included in DR [6]. Monopoly of energy generation companies that are owned\nby the state causes pricing schemes to be ineffective for enabling the user to be actively involved in\ntrading process of energy [7]. In order to focus on these issues, energy Internet is considered as one\nof the key enablers of third industrial evolution [8]. Energy Internet is considered as new paradigm\nshift for user and generation system [9]. By analogy with Internet properties, complete framework is\noffered by energy Internet for integration of each equipment that performs energy production, issuance,\ntransformation, storage and usage with basic Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) [10].\nStandard and modular energy units, i.e., solar panel, wind turbine, hydrogen, fuel cell, biomass and\nstorage system can be operated by plug and play modules [11]. Open standard based communication\nprotocol are added in plug and play paradigm to enhance the capability and interoperability for\nmany products, technologies, systems and solutions, which construct energy Internet. In this new\nevolving paradigm, the supplier and consumer are connected very closely and promptly because\nof implementing distributed and flexible systems [12]. Moreover, energy consumer with co-located\nenergy provisioner formulates local Internet of energy. Where, MG relieves the stress at reasonable\ndegree, that is caused by increasing energy demands. MG is considered as one of the reliable networks\nfor establishing connection between renewable resources and consumers along with managing storage\nunits [13]. It can either be treated as controllable load or production system and can work in connection\nwith grid. Nevertheless, owing to intermittent and changing nature of renewable energy resources,\nrestricted energy generation capacity and greater dependency of MG on uncontrolled renewable\nenergy resources lead to high level of fluctuation and disturbance of the system. For example, the state\nof unreliability that is brought by renewable energy resources will cause significant difference between\nproduction and demand, which rises several issues regarding power imbalance, voltage instability\nand frequency instability [14]. Thus, energy management techniques are needed to harness in order\nto reduce energy supply demand imbalance. To achieve ideal economic performance by MG while\nensuring reliability, various factors involve in energy Internet. It includes conventional fossil fuel based\ndispatch able generators and renewable energy based distributed producers. It is clearly non feasible\nto take each detail into account as it increases computational complexity dramatically. However,\nsmall uncertainty that rises from implementation or estimation in real world energy management\nsystem makes the system completely incomprehensible in practical point of view [15]. For instance,\nconsidering MG with Photo-Voltaic Cell (PVC), solar radiations suddenly become intense at day time.\nThat will increase generation of MG at certain time [16]. Similarly in case of wind turbine, speed of\nwind goes up any time and become stronger, which will cause grid frequency goes up [14]. Therefore,\ndynamics of energy generation behavior of renewable resources can not be ignored [17\u201319]. Literature\nwork is restricted to limited application of MG, where real world data is not considered while managing\nenergy distribution. However, comprehensive framework is required to improve energy management\nof real world data. Moreover, the prior statistical knowledge of uncertain renewable resources energy\nproduction was considered to be precisely known and power trade among various market players\nis completely neglected This is the motivation behind proposed algorithm that performs distributed\nenergy management along with integration of linear forecasting techniques, which makes proposed\nsystem more effective and reliable.\nTo utilize renewable energy resources effectively, Distributed Energy Management (DEM)\nalgorithm has been proposed that optimizes payoff of each player, i.e., users and MG. In order\nto overcome the uncertainties that are caused by renewable resources, forecasting techniques have\nbeen proposed, i.e., Gray wolf optimized Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (GARIMA) and\nCuckoo search Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (CARIMA). In DEM, GARIMA forecasting\ndata has been used for energy management as it performs more efficiently as compared to CARIMA in\ncurrent scenario. List of acronyms and list of symbols used in this paper are shown in table at the end\nof this paper.\n191\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2763\nThis work is an extension of [20]. Whereas, remaining paper has following organization. Section 2\ndiscusses related work regarding load forecasting and game theory. Section 3 gives details of problem\nstatement and contribution. Section 4 explains method and material regarding proposed forecasting\ntechniques and game theory. It includes DEM algorithm for optimization of MG and users cost.\nSection 5 explains simulations results of proposed techniques. Finally, Section 6 provides conclusion of\npresented work.\n2. Related Work\nProposed work focuses to solve distributed energy management at Micro Grid (MG) level in\nenergy Internet, using both game theory and data analytics techniques. There is recent surge in data\nanalytics that introduces mathematical tool, which addresses uncertainties [21]. While managing\nenergy, two main methodologies are used, i.e., stochastic optimization and robust optimization. These\nare widely used to handle data uncertainties [22]. Stochastic optimization in energy management\nsolutions is considered as one of the effective techniques for optimization of statistical objective function.\nIn case, the undefined numerical data has to be assumed in order to follow well-known probability\ndistribution. Real time energy management techniques that are having stochastic optimization are\nproposed to reduce operational cost [23]. In [24], multistage framework is proposed in order to\nreduce the cost of total energy system that is based on stochastic optimization. In order to cater\nmulti dimensional energy management stochastic dynamic programming methods are used [25].\nNonetheless, the precise calculation of probability distribution of the data that is not certain may get\ntremendous challenge in practical applications, which considers complex operation details and various\ncomplex constraints. Optimality performance is affected by impact of data uncertainties. However,\nit is not cater for in energy management approaches that contain stochastic optimization.\nRobust optimization based energy management approaches merely rely on limited information\nand enable distribution free model for uncertainties [26]. In energy management system, worst\ncase operation scenario is considered in optimization process. Consequently, energy management\napproaches can remove the negative impact of uncertainty in optimality performance. Thus,\nit outperforms the stochastic optimization. Novel pricing strategy is proposed, which promotes\nrobustness against uncertainties of power input [27]. Nonetheless, the robust version of controllable\nelectric load management issues are not ensured to be tractable that relies on appropriate design for\nobjective function modeling and building of uncertainty set.\nEver since the growing advancement in the field of advance ICT, large amount of data is collected\nregarding consumer behavior, states of battery, substations, customer devices, distributed energy\nresources, renewable output, weather conditions, video surveillance, etc. [28]. The energy generation\nusing PVC is considered to be one of the important components of electricity sector. It is also attaining\nattention of government because of increasing environmental issue and being cost effective. In [29],\nit is stated that PVC energy will be responsible to fulfill 16% of total energy consumption. PVC energy\nrelies on solar radiation does not remain constant always. The intermittent nature of PVC energy\nis experienced because of position of sun and movement of clouds at particular position. It causes\nvariation at any point in time within a day. Subsequently, it can be predicted accurately in a year.\nInformation of solar energy is greatest concern for operator and planners of electrical system. Hence,\nthere is sheer need of forecasting PVC power generation [30] using machine learning techniques.\nForecasting models that are mainly used for prediction of electrical load and the renewable energy\nresources are defined under three categories, i.e., statistical model: Auto Regressive (AR), Exponential\nSmoothing (ES) models [31], Artificial Intelligence (AI) Model: Neural Network (NN), Convolution\nNeural Network (CNN), Hybrid Models: neuro fuzzy models [32,33]. As a case study, electricity\ndemand of 10 countries are taken into account in order to analyze these methods. In [34] 5 different\nforecasting techniques are used, i.e., multi model, iterative, single model multivariate forecasting\nare analyzed in detail. It also covers issues such as NN designing, implementation and validation.\nIn [35], a combination of NN and Enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are used in order to\n192\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2763\nperform power forecasting. It focuses on feature selection. PVC generation is affected by many factor\napart of solar radiations. It may be affected by cloud movement, location of sun, etc. Nevertheless,\ntime series of power generation by PVC contains many well defined patterns such as there are peaks\nat afternoon and off peak in morning and evening. Subsequently, there is no generation at night\ntimings. Therefore time series patterns can not be ignored [36]. Auto Regressive Integrated Moving\nAverage (ARIMA) is used for univariate time series forecasting because solar generation tends to follow\nspecific pattern and it is proven to be efficient on account of flexibility. It also performs its orderly\nsearching at every level. Thus it determines best fit model for particular time series. Optimization\nof parameters has significant impact on the performance of forecasting algorithms. Meta heuristic\ntechniques are applied on many forecasting techniques, i.e., ARIMA [37] Neural Network (NN) [38],\nSupport Vector Regression (SVR) [39] in literature for improving performance. Game theory concept\nis widely applied on MG energy management studies. It provides distributed self organizing and\nself optimizing solution of the problem having conflicting objective function.In broader aspect, game\ntheory is characterized in two categories in context of players. One category includes players with\nbinding agreement among them. Second category includes those players who are not having binding\nagreement among them [40]. In non cooperative game theory, main focus is on predicting individual\nstrategies and it also asses players that make decisions to find Nash Equilibrium (NE). It provides\nframework for performing analytical framework, i.e., DEM that is devised for characterizing the\ninteraction among players and decision making process to achieve NE. The strategic outcome among\nplayers can be improved under mutual commitment.\nIn order to handle non cooperative game theory based energy management, multi user based\nStackelberg game is used to optimize the payoff of each player [41]. In [42], multi stage market model\nis proposed, that is based on cooperative game to reduce the cost of utility, whereas it maximizes the\ntotal profit of the market. In order to cater dispatch problem in integration of renewable resources\ngeneration and energy storage, a cooperative distributed energy scheduling algorithm was proposed\nin [43].\n3. Problem Statement and Contributions\nTo make efficient use of renewable resources, this paper focuses on distributed energy management\nproblem. It aims to maximize objective function of each player and satisfying user demand of electricity\nand guaranteeing reliable system operations. Due to uncontrollable and uncertain nature of energy\ngeneration by renewable resources [44], we used electricity generation forecasting techniques to get\nshort term prediction value. Afterwards, distributed MG energy management problem has been\naddressed using non cooperative game theory as it ignores common commitment of players and it\ncontains low communication overhead [40]. Optimization of storage capacity in MG has vital role in\ncontext of efficient management of electric load, which has also been addressed in this paper. Following\nare the contributions of our work:\n1. Game theory and data-centric approaches are adapted in order to address MG electric load\nmanagement problem. In order to overcome uncertainties caused by PVC generation, linear\nforecasting technique ARIMA has been used for forecasting. Parameters of ARIMA, i.e., AR and\nMoving Average (MA) are optimized through GWO and named as GARIMA,\n2. Energy management problem has been solved using two stage Stackelberg game theory to capture\nthe dynamic interaction and interconnection among users and MG. Where, MG acts as a leader\nand users act like followers. Besides, if there exist a scenario where energy demand of users\nincreases as compare to MG capacity of energy generation, MG purchases energy from utility.\nFurthermore, energy cost of MG has also been reduced by using energy storage mechanism,\n3. Two proposed techniques, i.e., GARIMA and CARIMA have been used for forecasting purpose.\nParameters optimization of ARIMA has been performed using Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO)\nand Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm, where GARIMA gives better result as compare to CARIMA\n193\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2763\nand other conventional techniques. Forecasting results of GARIMA technique are used in DEM\nalgorithm in order to reduce uncertainties that are caused by renewable resources historic data and\n4. For non cooperative game of MG and users, existence of NE is proved using Stackelberg game\ntheory. Furthermore, iterative DEM algorithm is proposed for MG to prove NE.\n4. Material and Method\nThis section elaborates material and method regarding proposed system model. Two stage\nStackelberg game theory in SG is presented in system model. Multiple residential users N = {1, 2, ....n}\nalong with single MG are taken into account. MG is taken as supplier of power in order to provide\npower stability to users. MG contains smart meter in order to help users to schedule their energy\nusage. It is also equipped with PVC storage system. PVC provides power to fulfill requirements of\nresidential users and to charge the battery. Furthermore, surplus energy is sent to the utility as shown\nin Figure 1. After receiving price policy of utility from information network, users send demand to MG.\nIn the presented system model, users have both shift able and non shift able loads. In order to perform\nenergy usage scheduling at users side, single day is considered. K represents each time slot in a day.\nIn this scenario, the utility receives electricity demand from users for each time slots in a single day\nand real time price are communicated to users regarding each time slot in a day. {Pk = pk1, ...pkj , ....pkm}\nwhere dataset shows time slots in a single day. MG sets its prices, to optimize the payoff, according to\nthe demand of users in real time.\nSolar Generated \nPower\nSolar Power \nGeneration\nforcasting using \nhistorical data\nResidential \nUsers\nSolar Panel for \nElectricity \nGeneration\nBattery Storage for \nSolar generated \nPower\nX\nP(k)\nUtility \nCompany Microgrid\nFigure 1. Interaction among User and Micro grid.\n4.1. Cost Model of Users\nLet us assume, multiple users are considered in the proposed system model with a set of\nN = {1, 2, ....N}. Whole day is divided into K time slots. ln(k) represents energy utilization of n\nusers that contains both shift able and non shift able load. Equations (1)\u2013(6) have been taken from [45].\nDaily energy consumption of load is explained with the help of equation below:\nln = [ln(1), ...., ln(k), .....ln(K)] (1)\nMG offers energy for daily load consumption. Lets assume xn(k) is energy demand that is sent\nto MG by users in k time slots, where k \u03b5 K. So that energy that is demanded by users from MG is\nwritten as:\nxn = [xn(l), ..., xn(k), ...xn(K)] (2)\n194\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2763\nSum of the total amount of energy used by users is represented as:\nXk =\nN\n\u2211\nn=1\nxkn (3)\nIn order to calculate Peak Average Ratio (PAR) of energy that is demanded by users. Peak\nconsumption is represented as:\nX(peak) = max\nk\u03b5K\nXk (4)\nAverage user consumption is calculated as:\nX(average) =\n1\nK \u2211k\u03b5K\nXk (5)\nThus, PAR of total energy consumption by users is calculated as:\nPAR =\nX(peak)\nX(average)\n(6)\nCost function of user Un relies on type of pricing mechanism that has been formulated by MG.\nEffective pricing scheme should be employed by the utility and MG to encourage users to actively\nbecome a part of energy consumption scheduling planning. Which helps to make effective plan to\ncharge electricity price from users. Following assumptions are made:\n1. MG is responsible for providing energy to user at any time. Hence, the cost function of user\nregarding energy consumption by user at any time slot k \u03b5 K is function of energy consumption\nXk by N users,\n2. In daily life, energy consumption by user at certain time slot is smooth function or at least it is\npiecewise smooth function and always increasing. Likewise, cost function of user follows the\ndemand Xk,\n3. Cost function also depends on timings of energy consumption, apart of energy consumption\nby user.\nOwing to the assumptions discussed above, quadratic cost function is used because it is non\nlinear and strictly convex in nature. As it is mostly utilized in literature [40]. Thus, cost function of\nusers is as follows [45]:\nCkXk = akX2k + bkXk (7)\nwhere, ak > 0 and bk > 0 are fixed parameters that have maximum value at peak demand hours. CkXk\nrepresents total cost of energy consumption by kth user. Whereas, total cost of N user is calculated as\nfollows [45]:\nUn,k = (akXk + bk)xkn = pk(Xk)x\nk\nn (8)\nwhere, pkm(Xk) represents energy price by MG at time slot k. Price model confirms that energy price\nincreases as increase in energy consumption Xk happens. Consequently, users are convinced to shift\ntheir daily load from on peak hour to off peak hours. Moreover, behavior of the user in different time\nslots regarding consumption of energy is also affected via modifying ak and bk. Total cost of user n in a\nday is calculated as:\nUn(xn, x\u2212n, pkm) =\nK\n\u2211\nk=1\n[Pk(Xk)xkn] (9)\nwhere, x\u2212n = [x1, ..., xn\u22121, xn+1, ...xN ] represents energy demand of N users except n user. Equation (9)\nclearly shows that cost function of user is directly dependent on consumption of energy. Consumption\n195\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2763\nof energy can be managed by shifting demand of on peak demand hours to off peak hours. Hence,\ncost function of users can be reduced as:\nmin\nxkn\nUn(xn, x\u2212n, pkm) (10)\n4.2. MG Cost Model with Storage Capacity\nFor efficient energy management, MG and N users are agreed upon the energy parameter in order\nto avoid any kind of conflict. Total amount of energy that is needed by all users is xkm and the price pkm\nis decided by MG in such way to maximize its cost function, i.e., B. Likewise, ym is maximum storage\nrequired by MG to store the energy generated by PVC. Optimal solution must satisfy objective of both\nplayers, i.e., users and MG. Moreover, energy that is generated using PVC will be forecast, in order to\ndecide energy price pkm per time slot k effectively [35]. Total electricity that is demanded from the users\nhas to be less or equal than electricity which is produced by MG as represented in equation below:\nXkm \u2264 Gkm \u2200 k \u2208 K (11)\nwhere, Gkm is the total capacity of the MG in time slot k. In order to complete energy trading successfully,\nboth players of game, i.e., users and MG exchange messages among each other and both of them agree\non the trading parameters.\nHowever, energy xkm demanded by total no. of users from MG m must satisfy following constraint:\nK\n\u2211\nk=1\nGkm + Dm \u2265\nN\n\u2211\nn=1\nK\n\u2211\nk=1\nxkm, and em \u2264\nK\n\u2211\nk=1\nGkm (12)\nwhere, Dm represents amount of energy that is requested to utility, if renewable resources do not\ngenerate enough energy for fulfilling demand of N users. em is predicted energy that is generated by\nPVC explained in Section 4.3.1. We consider amount of energy, generated by PVC, in a single day.\nMoreover, price per unit energy Pkm is decided and announced by MG. In current scenario, Pkm is price\nthat is charged by MG. Therefore, energy that is required by users should satisfy constraint given in\nEquations (11) and (12). The main challenge that is being faced by MG is to decide optimum energy\nprices Pkm and optimum battery storage ym to increase MG revenue.\nMost of the hybrid systems, which contain both generation plant and renewable resources, are difficult\nto manage; specifically if storage system is placed with every user and resultantly surplus energy\nis supplied to the utility [45]. Therefore, it is required to have centralized system to formalize the\nmechanism which decides the distribution of energy among all stake holders. Distribution of energy\nis purely on the basis of generation and requirement basis. Assumption is made that generation of\nPVC is cheaper than conventional energy generation methods. MG prioritize the demand of N users\nand to charge the batteries. While at second priority, surplus energy is to be transmitted back for\ngenerating revenue by trading. For MG, it is assumed that PVC generation is em(k) \u2265 0 in time slot k.\nPVC power generation provides energy, em(k)\u2212 elm(k)\u2212 eb(k) = 0 that means surplus energy does\nnot exist that can be sold back to utility. Where, elm(k) represents PVC energy to be distributed among\nusers to fulfill their demand. Whereas, eb(k) depicts power that is needed to charge the battery. In case\nem(k) \u2212 elm(k) \u2212 ebn(k) \u2265 0, MG is having extra energy which has been generated by PVC for selling.\nProfit of MG, that it generates when it sells surplus energy to the utility is represented as:\nUC =\nK\n\u2211\nk=1\n\u03bbs\n(\nem(k)\u2212 elm(k)\u2212 ebm(k)) (13)\nwhere, \u03bbs depicts the PVC power selling price in cents/kWh. Currently, profit generated by selling\nelectricity to utility is in form of price subsidies that is provided by the government to MG. These days,\n196\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2763\nsubsidy standard is \u03bbs is 6.3 cents/kWh for distribution of energy [46]. Total cost of PVC generation is\nas follows:\nCPVCm = am(L\u0302 + \u0394) + bm(L\u0302 + \u0394)\n2 + cm + F|\u0394| (14)\nwhere am, bm and cm are cost parameters of MG with PVC power generation and ((L\u0302) + \u0394) represents\nthe prediction of PVC power [47]. Whereas, L\u0302 shows prediction of power generated by PVC in next\nyear and \u0394 shows prediction error. F is chosen as penalty factor of prediction. Where, F < 0 shows\nthat payoff of MG is decreased if prediction result is not accurate. Hence, it causes restriction of power\nagreement in market.\nPVC power often needs storage system because it has to store surplus energy once users\nrequirements are fulfilled. Storage system is irreplaceable need for PVC energy generation. Then,\nMG will provide energy to users at demand peak hours. Where, utility charges more price from\nconsumer, in order to reduce cost of MG. These days, number of types of batteries that are available\nin market, i.e., Sodium/Sulfur batteries, Zinc/Bromine batteries and lithium-ion batteries [48]. Each\nbattery type has certain charging and discharging cycles depending on their material, technology and\nsize. Afterwards, battery life is expired. Hence, depreciation cost needs to be taken under consideration.\nBattery cost function is either defined as quadratic function that is based on charging and discharging\ncapacity or it is taken as linear function. In the proposed scenario, battery cost function is taken as\nlinear function. Equations (15)\u2013(23) are taken from [45]. It is assumed that ym is the battery capacity\nthat is needed by MG and it may ranges within certain limits:\nym \u03b5 [ylm, y\nu\nm] (15)\nwhere ylm and yum represent lower and upper limits of the battery capacity. Equation (16) gives daily\ndepreciation cost function:\nCbatm (ym) = \u03bb\nbatym (16)\nwhere Cbatm (ym) represents cost of battery depreciation. Its unit is cents/kWh and it also maintains\ncorrelation with the material and type of the battery. Cbatm (ym) shows linear increasing function that\nis based on total capacity ym of the storage. However, if storage of the battery is not enough to store\ngenerated PVC power, it will be waisted and consequently, the payment will be increased. Therefore,\nit is required to decide optimal capacity of the battery ym. Other parameters that have important role\nin storage optimization other than battery capacity parameters. Charging and discharging efficiency of\nbattery are parameters that are required to be taken under consideration other than battery capacity\nparameters. It is assumed, 0 < \u03b7ch < 1 and 0 < \u03b7disch < 1 show battery charging and discharging\nefficiency. s = [s1, ..., sk, ..., sK] gives state of the battery for complete day. Battery capacity has also\nbeen defined. Hence, Equation (17) gives state of battery and capacity of battery inequality constraints:\n0 \u2264 sk \u2264 ym (17)\nhkch and h\nk\ndisch are variables that represent pattern of battery charging and discharging in each time slot\nK in binary form. At one time, charging or discharging of the battery can be taken place that is given\nin Equation (18):\nhkch + h\nk\ndisch \u2264 1 (18)\nstate of the energy of battery at any time slot k is given as under:\nsk+1 = sk + \u03b7chebk \u2212\n1\n\u03b7disch\n. blk (19)\neb(k) \u2264 hch(k)Bch (20)\n197\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2763\neb(k) is amount of energy which is required to charge the battery from PVC generation. Besides, bl(k)\nshows total energy to discharge the battery that is consumed while satisfying users requirement. Upper\nand lower limit of the battery must be satisfied while charging and discharging the battery. Hence,\nEquations (21) and (22) must be satisfied by the values of eb(k) and bl(k).\neb(k) \u2264 hkdischBch (21)\nbl(k) \u2264 hkdischBdisch (22)\nekm shows total energy generated by PVC. It is on the basis of balancing principle, and bl(k) represents\nenergy stored by battery and Dm is amount of energy received from utility or vice versa. It is shown as:\nxkm = e\nl\nm(k) + b\nl(k) + Dm (23)\nEnergy management becomes complicated because of existence of PVC-battery storage. MG has\nto pay cost for PVC generation and depreciation cost of battery. Besides, MG generates revenue by\nselling energy to users and surplus energy to utility. Thus, the total cost of MG is calculated as:\nBkm = x\nk\nm + C\nbat\nm (y) + C\nPVC\nm + Dm (24)\nwhere, xkm represents energy that is demanded by N from MG in time slot k. Cbatm and CPVCm are\nexplained in Equations (13) and (15). Equations (13), (15) and (23) show total load of MG. In proposed\nscenario, if PVC power generation plant uses large battery that cannot be fully charged, consequently\nlarge amount of battery storage will be wasted, which affects daily cost of MG. Therefore, it is required\nto optimize battery storage capacity, so that it may be used optimally. Solar power generation fully\ncharge it in working time. Solar generation provides elm(k) energy for charging the battery in time slot\nk. Thus, battery obtains \u03b7cheb(k) considering efficiency of charging. Which is shown as follows:\n\u03bbs\nK\n\u2211\nk=1\neb(k) = \u03bbsy/\u03b7ch (25)\nFurthermore,\nK\n\u2211\nk=1\nelm =\nK\n\u2211\nk=1\nxkm \u2212\nK\n\u2211\nk=1\nxkn \u2212\nK\n\u2211\nk=1\nbl(k) (26)\nwhere \u2211Kk=1 b\nl(k) = \u03b7dischym\nNow Equation (21) is represented as:\nB(Xkm(p\nk\nm), ym) = (\nK\n\u2211\nk=1\npk(Xk)\u2212 \u03bbs) + xk\u03bbbatm + ym + \u03d5 (27)\n\u03bbbat = \u03bbbat + \u03bbs/\u03b7ch \u2212 \u03b7disch\u03bbs (28)\n\u03d5 = \u03bbs\nK\n\u2211\nk=1\nlk + (\u03bbSP \u2212 \u03bbs)\nK\n\u2211\nk=1\nek (29)\nThe sole objective behind this work is to find an optimal battery capacity and best strategy for\npricing of energy for the N users so that daily cost of MG will be reduced:\nmin\npkm\nB(xkm(p\nk), ym) (30)\n198\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2763\nwhere xkm represents total amount of energy demanded by N users and ym shows total storage capacity.\n4.3. Game Formulation and Analysis\nSingle leader and multi follower Stackelberg game is proposed in [49] that studies communication\nbetween MG and users. Basically, multi player game is used in which MG, being leader decides price\npkm of power that has to be charged from users and optimal storage capacity of the battery. Whereas,\nusers as a followers decide amount of energy xkm to be demanded from MG. Proposed work is extension\nof the work related to game theory presented in [45]. Proposed game theory is shown in strategic form\n\u03c2 in equation below.\n\u03c2 = (NU M), (xkn, Un)n\u2208N , (pkm, B)k\u2208K, (\u0002Pk)k\u2208K (31)\nStrategic form of proposed game has following components:\n1. Users cost function U shows cost of energy consumption that is received by N users in time\nslot k,\n2. Whereas, B captures the benefit that is gained by MG after supplying energy xkm to N set of users,\n3. Pkm defines price of energy that is defined by MG against each time slot k,\n4. ym define optimal storage capacity that is required to minimize the cost function of MG,\n5. Cost function of user: Un(xn, x\u2212n, pkm),\n6. Cost function of MG: B(xkm(pk), ym).\nNonetheless, MG tends to opt optimal price per unit energy. Thus, proposed algorithm reaches the\nNE. Where, leader, i.e., MG will utilize optimal amount of energy on the basis of given strategy \u03c2 and\nN users will demand optimal amount of energy xkm from MG. In this paper, proposed strategic form\n\u03c2 of proposed algorithm has been used to achieve NE for non cooperative game theory , if and only\nif cost function of MG, i.e., leader and cost function of users, i.e., follower N; must satisfy following\ninequalities shown as:\nUn(xk\u2217n , xk\u2217\u2212n, pk\u2217m ) \u2264 Un(xkn, xk\u2217\u2212n, pkm)\nBm(pk\u2217m , xkn(pk\u2217m ), ym\u2217) \u2264 Bm(pk\u2217m , xkn(pkm), ym)\n(32)\nwhere, pk\u2217m \u03b5 pk\u2217, pk\u2217m are represented as price per unit time energy at NE that is finalized by MG for\ntime slot k. Whereas, y\u2217m shows total storage capacity of battery after achieving NE. Similarly, xk\u2217m is\ntotal energy that is requested by users N for time period k.\nIn non cooperative game where multi level hierarchy is involved, pure solution for equilibrium is\nnot ensured in every case. Therefore, DEM algorithm has been proposed to determine the presence\nof NE. Primarily, variational equality is considered to be more socially stable as compare to other\nequilibrium methods [41]. Each user is considered while determining variational equality as mentioned\nin [42].\nProposition 1. In case of users n \u03b5 N, daily cost function Un is continuously differentiable in xn for price pkm\nand electricity consumption by users xn. Therefore, strategy space of cost function of users Un is a non empty\nconvex compact subset of a Euclidean space.\nProof. It is continuously differentiable in xn because of consistent characteristics of the daily cost\nfunction U (xn, x\u2212n, pk). The Hessian of U (xn, x\u2212n, pk) is positive semi definite. Resultantly, cost\nfunction of user n is convex in xn. Proposition 1 shows daily cost function U (xn, x\u2212n, pk) is\ncontinuously differentiable. It is also convex in xn. Owing the fact, energy cost Un(xn, x\u2212n) has\ncontinuous quadratic form in context of xn. Preposition 1 is prerequisite of Proposition 2.\nProposition 2. For \u2200n\u03b5 N and time slot k \u03b5 K, the NE of the non cooperative game exists and it is also unique.\n199\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2763\nProof. According to the proof already mentioned in [45], because cost function UN(xn, x\u2212n, pk) is\nconvex in xn, the NE is proved to be present in non cooperative game as well as it is proven to\nbe distinct.\nProposition 3. The distinct NE (x\u2217n, x\u2217\u2212n) that is proven in Preposition 2 is Pareto optimality.\nProof. Pareto optimality is defined as the opted strategy state where no player changes its payoff\nby updating the user\u2019s strategies without affecting remaining user\u2019s payoff [45]. As per proof of\nProposition 2, non cooperative game has achieved NE among all users. Where, each user increases his\npayoff, which depends on others users strategy. Afterwards, no user can change its payoff without\ntaking consent to modify other users strategies [48]. Subsequently, it is said that NE (x\u2217n, x\u2217\u2212n) is\nachieved, i.e., Pareto optimality. Preposition 2 expresses that, there exist distinct NE of non cooperative\ngame for fixed price of MG. Nonetheless, if price will be changed then the NE will be different. On the\nbasis of Preposition 3, it depicts the strategy against energy consumption by users will reach to pareto\noptimality and each user cannot change its payoff without affecting payoff of others.\nProposition 4. For battery storage capacity ym \u03b5 [ylm, yum] and the energy consumption vector of MG. There is\nunique battery capacity y\u2217m. It is understood that there is specific value of cost B(xm, ym) with a certain battery\ncapacity. It is also assumed that there is only specific battery capacity that can minimize MG cost B. Proof of\nproposition is mentioned in [45].\nFrom Propositions 1\u20133, it is clearly seen that non cooperative game is based on payoff function.\nIt encourages residential user and MG to choose optimal strategy to minimize cost function of MG and\nuser. Thus, payoff of follower and leader may be increased.\n4.3.1. PVC Power Forecasting Algorithm\nThis section explains forecasting techniques to be further utilized in DEM.\nARIMA: Forecasting is performed using this technique by utilizing historic values. AR represents\nlags of differenced series that is given in Equation (33) [50]; MA is known as lag of time series\nand prediction error, which is required to be subtracted in order to make it static that is termed\nas \u201cintegrated\u201d. Non seasonal ARIMA model that is represented as ARIMA(p, d, q) [51], is given\nas under:\nYt = \u03c61Yt\u22121 + \u03c62Yt\u22122 + ..... + \u03c6pYt\u2212p + \u03b5t\u2212\n\u03b81\u03b5t\u22121 \u2212 \u03b82\u03b5t\u22122 \u2212 ... \u2212 \u03b82\u03b5t\u22122 \u2212 ... \u2212 \u03b8q\u03b5t\u2212q\n(33)\nwhere Yt represents actual values of time series and \u03b5t shows error at certain time t; \u03c6i and \u03b8i\nrepresent vectors based on values of AR and MA; p and q are integers in vector \u03c6i(i = 1, 2, 3, ....p) and\n\u03b8i(i = 1, 2, ...q). Random errors \u03b5t is distributed with mean zero and constant variance \u03c32\u03b5 . In order to\nfind optimal results, three stage model was proposed: (i) Recognition of the model, (ii) Estimation and\n(iii) Diagnostic Checking of the proposed model [52].\nRecognition: No. of potential AR and MA orders to be selected using Auto Correlation Function\n(ACF) and Partial ACF (PACF). In order to analyze stationarity of time series, famous method is used\nthat includes Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron unit root test. It considers null\nhypothesis. These tests ensure that time series is not stationary. Details related to these methods are\nalready mentioned in literature.\nEstimation: In this stage, all the parameters that are identified in stage 1 are estimated for the\nARIMA model by using iterative least square. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian\nInformation Criterion (BIC) values are used to find best values in model as mentioned in [51] is given\nas under:\nAIC = Mlog(\u03c32) + 2(p + q + 1) (34)\n200\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2763\nand\nBIC = Mlog(\u03c32) + 2(p + q + 1)logT (35)\nwhere M shows total no. of observation that are used for estimation of parameters and \u03c32 shows mean\nsquare error.\nDiagnosticChecking: Depending on ACF and PACF of the residual, in dependency of residual can\nbe analyzed. If residual is according to white noise, residual of the model are proven to be random in\nnature. The sample space-time ACFs is required to be effectively zero.\nIn [50], Ljung-Box test is used on actual time series or to the residual. Null hypothesis is considered\nfor fitting the model which shows that series is representing the noise, and the alternative hypothesis\nstates that one or more autocorrelation till lag m are not zero. The test static is shown as under\nmentioned in [51]:\nQ\u2217 = M(M + 2)\nm\n\u2211\nK=1\nr2k\nM \u2212 K (36)\nwhere M shows total no. of observations that are used to finalize the model and m represent total\nlags. The statistics Q\u2217 go along with X 2 distribution having (M-K) level of freedom. Where, K shows\nnumber of parameters that are estimated in model and rk shows ACF of residual at lag k. In case it not\nappropriate, stage 1 is again used for recognition of another model.\nCuckoo Search (CS): Idea was given by Yang and Deb [53]. It is one of the latest meta heuristic\ntechniques. It is also proven in recent studies that it works better than Genetic Algorithm (GA) and\nParticle Swarm Optimization (PSO). No. of AR and MA parameters are pre assumed (pmax+qmax)\npreviously. Each parameter is individual in population, which contains respective solution from\nsolution set. Functionality of CS is shown in Figure 2. First of all, the corresponding cost function of\nweight optimization should be taken out [38]. where, p and q are row of population matrix, which\ncontain their best solution after optimization.\nGray Wolf Optimizer (GWO): Mirjalili et al. proposed GWO in 2014. It is a meta heuristic\ntechnique, which mimics the leadership and hunting behavior of GWO. Grey wolves population\nconsist of 4 types, i.e., alpha (\u03b1), beta (\u03b2), delta (\u03b4) and omega (\u03c9) [54,55]. Flow diagram of GWO\nalgorithm is shown in Figure 3.\nTwo proposed techniques are proposed, i.e., CARIMA and GARIMA, both of them perform better\ndue to optimization of parameters. Simulation section proves that proposed forecasting techniques\noutperformed conventional techniques in predicting energy generation by PVC. However, GARIMA\nforecasting results outperformed CARIMA algorithm also. Therefore, GARIMA forecasting technique\nhas been used in DEM algorithm to ensure accuracy of work.\nEvaluation parameter: Objective function is defined in order to evaluate parameters. It can either\nbe mathematical or experimental function that will give desired output. Basically, function is based on\nsubtraction of actual values with predicted value. In our proposed scenario, Root Mean Absolute Error\n(RMSE) and MAPE is termed as evaluation parameter and that is shown as:\nMAPE =\n1\nT\nTM\n\u2211\ntm=1\n| Av\nFv\n| \u2217 100 (37)\nRMSE =\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a 1\nT\nTM\n\u2211\ntm=1\n(Av \u2212 Fv)2 (38)\nwhere, Av is actual time series and F\u0302v is predicted time series.\nDistributed Energy Management (DEM) Algorithm: After analyzing energy generation em by\nPVC using prediction method, i.e., GARIMA and energy demand xkm from N users, MG tries to find\noptimum price pkm and storage capacity of battery ym that is used to store the energy generated by\nPVC using DEM Algorithm. Each of them will be reached to NE as per different battery capacities and\n201\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2763\nprice. After comparing the daily cost corresponding to battery capacity, DEM selects best response\nstrategy that will choose minimal cost pkm.

Simulation and Discussion\n5.1. Data Description\nIn forecasting techniques, PVC power production data is used. Dataset is taken from Elia,\nBelgium\u2019s electricity transmission system operator site [56]. Data contains 15 min interval power\nproduction of 5 years, January 2013 to December 2018.\n5.2. Experimental Results\nIn this section, simulations are used in order to verify the effectiveness of game theoretic energy\nmanagement using Stackelberg game theory. Apart of game theory, accuracy of PVC production\nforecasting has also been analyzed. Assumption is made that 6 users are connected to MG for getting\nsupply of electricity. N users have both shift able load and non shift able load, furthermore power\nconsumption of users are shown in Figure 4. Single day is represented in form of 24 h time slots, i.e., k.\nUsage of electricity varies on the basis of peak demand hours, off peak demand hours and mid peak\nhours at each slot.\nHere, effectiveness of proposed game theory is analyzed between users and MG. nth user\ncan increase or decrease his payoff by adjustment of energy usage. Furthermore, MG focuses on\noptimization of payoff by announcing optimal energy price pkm and size of the storage battery, i.e., ym.\nIn proposed work, pricing scheme that has been used is ToU. The whole day is split into 24 h\ntime slots k. Moreover, single day is composed of three main chunks. Peak demand hours, off peak\ndemand hours and mid peak demand hours make basis of chunks creation. Different pricing schemes\nare followed by pricing parameters.\nUser consumption is based on building and homes energy consumption. Each user is having\n15 to 20 non shift able home appliances that cannot be shifted in any other hour of the day. Demand\nSide Management (DSM) has already been discussed in [45]. It has not been discussed for each user\nin our work. Unanimously, energy consumption by all users N is considered. Nevertheless, energy\ndistribution by MG, energy pricing pkm and capacity of the battery ym have been discussed in detail.\nMG contains renewable resources, i.e., PVC in current scenario.\n203\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2763\nFigure 4. Consumption of Users in 24 h.\nFigure 5 represents the energy distribution that is done by MG in K time slots without game\noptimization. However, Figure 6 shows evenly energy distribution is being carried out among users,\nbattery and utility, after equilibrium achieved by NE. Energy is received from utility, if solar radiations\nare not enough for production of PVC. Besides, in remaining hours power is optimally used that is\ngenerated by solar radiations and stored in battery. Figure 7 shows energy consumption in a single\nday by MG without incorporation of game theory and applying DEM using Tables 1 and 2. Figure 8\nshows solar power energy consumption by users, battery and company with game, which shows the\nevenly distribution of energy generated by PVC.\nFigure 5. Energy Distribution without Game.\nFigure 6. Energy Distribution with Game.\n204\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2763\nFigure 7. PVC Energy Distribution without Game.\nFigure 8.

Nevertheless,\nproposed game theoretic energy management will not be affected by timings of day light and intensity.\nMG contains 2 kW PVC production capacity. Solar cells energy production per day is represented\n205\nSustainability 2019, 11, 2763\nin Figure 9. PVC power is generated during 0600 to 1700 h. Parameters related to battery storage\nand charging and discharging are given in Table 1 and battery can be discharged at any time except\ncharging hours. Cost of users depends on discharging time. It has minimal impact on the cost except\nbattery discharges at peak demand hours, i.e., 17:00 to 22:00 h. In single hour, charging and discharging\nof the battery is 1.5 kWh [9]. Besides, 7.2 cents/kWh is battery charging and discharging efficiency [20].\nIn a current scenario, MG finds optimal solution for energy management using NE. To facilitate\noptimization and making error free prediction, MAPE is also brought under light. Figure 10 represents\nMAPE values of 5 forecasting algorithms that includes Back Propagation (BP), SVM, Genetic Stacked\nAuto Encoder (GSAE), CARIMA and GARIMA techniques. Step 1 shows that historical data is used\nfor further forecasting PVC production. Data after forecasting is added in historical data and used\nfor forecasting future PVC production is called as step 2 and so on. Figure 10 clearly shows that\nvalue of MAPE increases as forecasting steps increases. Simulation represents existing techniques as\nwell as proposed techniques, i.e., CARIMA and GARIMA in Figure 10. Results are clearly shown in\nFigure 11a,b that GARIMA technique not only outperformed existing technique as well as second\nproposed technique, i.e., CARIMA in terms of RMSE in hourly and daily load forecasting. Results show\nactual and predicted results of proposed techniques. Hence, for achieving NE in game theory, GARIMA\npredicted results are used in DEM algorithm for performing energy management more efficiently.\nFigure 9.

Conclusions and Future Work\nIn our work, energy management system has been presented that contains single MG and\nmultiple users. In order to analyze game theory using proposed distributed algorithm, i.e., DEM,\nwhich represents the complete mechanism that how MG optimally decides price that has to be charged\nfrom users. Moreover, battery storage capacity is also optimized. The continuous non cooperative\ngame theory is used to model interaction among MG and consumers. To ensure efficient use of\nPVC generated energ, short term PVC power production forecasting is performed. Two forecasting\ntechniques are proposed, i.e., GARIMA and CARIMA. GARIMA forecasting results turned out to be\nbetter as compared to CARIMA and other conventional techniques in MAPE. The forecasting results\nare then used to analyze the impact on payoff of both players in game theory. In non cooperative\nscenario, Stackelberg game theory is used to prove NE among two players, i.e., users and MG. DEM\nalgorithm has been proposed to prove NE among two players. Energy distribution among users after\napplying game theory gives better results as compared to results produced without applying game\ntheory. Forecasting results of hourly and daily generated energy data also validate that GARIMA\nforecasting algorithm performs best as compared to CARIMA forecasting algorithm. Consequently,\nGARIMA forecasting data has been used in DEM in order to ensure precision in energy management.\nThe future directions of our work will be focused on non cooperative energy management among\nmultiple MGs. Apart of inclusion of multiple MG, no. of players in game will also be increased, i.e.,\nutility in order to improve flexibility in the proposed system model. Multiple renewable resources will\nbe considered for forecasting purpose in order to make the system dynamic in context of distributed\nenergy management. In order to prove efficiency of DEM algorithm, comparison with existing energy\nmanagement algorithm will be performed.\nAuthor Contributions: A.N., N.J. and M.B.R. proposed, implemented and wrote heuristic schemes.

Variable speed seawater pumped storage, which has a large\npower controllable range and flexible modes of operation, is an important tool to be applied in\ndistribution networks to realize peak shaving and valley filling, and to mitigate the negative effects\nof REG. This paper presents a two-stage coordinated optimal scheduling model for the day-ahead\nand real-time operation of active distribution networks containing seawater pumped storage, REG,\nand flexible loads. In the model, seawater pumped storage and flexible loads are dispatched in\nthe first day-ahead stage based on short-term forecast information of REG and load demands to\nminimize total operational costs. Then in the second real-time stage, the operation schedule of\nseawater pumped storage is adjusted to mitigate the negative effects of forecast errors of REG on the\noperation of active distribution networks. Network nodes power quality is improved and power loss\nis reduced. Applying the model, disadvantages of low accuracy short-term forecast are minimized\nwhereas advantages of high accuracy ultra-short term forecast are fully taken.

Introduction\nThere are rich renewable energy resources in China offshore. In recent years, the percentage\nof penetration in renewable energy in distribution networks has increased dramatically [1\u20133].\nPower output of renewable energy generation (REG) like wind turbine (WT) generators and photo\nvoltaic (PV) arrays have high randomness and fluctuation attributes. The controllability of WT and PV\noutput is low [4,5], which rese new challenges to the operation of distribution networks. To increase\nits operation reliability and economy, energy storage provides an attractive solution because it has fast\npower response speed and strong energy shifting capabilities [6\u20138]. Compared with traditional energy\nstorage technologies such as lead acid battery banks, hydrogen energy storage, and flywheel energy\nstorage, etc., variable speed seawater pumped storage has many advantages, such as larger storage\ncapacity, higher energy storage efficiency, lower per kilowatt capital and maintenance costs, longer\nservice life, and it also can provide additional inertia energy for networks [9,10]. Meanwhile, compared\nwith traditional pumped storage, offshore ocean is used as the lower reservoir for variable speed\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2014; doi:10.3390/su10062014 www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability212\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2014\nseawater pumped storage. The amount of water resources are inexhaustible and total construction\ncosts can be reduced. But how to dispatch the distribution networks that contain variable speed\nseawater pumped storage and REG, reaching a high operation performance and having high economic\nbenefits, is still a problem for the network operators.\nCurrent distribution networks were operated in a passive fashion. The traditional operating method\nis no longer applicable to new distribution networks which contain REG, energy storage, and flexible\nloads, etc. In recent years, the concept of active distribution networks was proposed [11\u201313]. Compared\nwith traditional distribution networks, this network is able to manage the power of REG, energy storage,\nand flexible loads actively, having the advantages of increasing the operation reliability and minimizing the\ntotal operation cost and power losses of the distribution networks [14,15]. Besides, the active distribution\nnetworks can provide additional spinning reserve capacities to alleviate the negative impacts of the\nstochastic fluctuations of REG and load demands on itself at the distribution network level. Problems\nof declining power quality are induced by stochastic, uncertain fluctuations of power of REG and load\ndemands. These problems are solved locally by appropriate dispatch of distributed generators and\nenergy storage [16]. In the dispatch of active distribution networks, an optimization model that can both\nachieve a global optimal solution and provide good performance is demanded [17]. Dynamic economic\ndispatch method [18] and consensus based dispatch method [19] can be applied to generate a dispatch\nschedule. However, the performance cannot meet this demand. The power flexibility and energy storability\ncharacteristics of energy storage in active distribution networks are not fully utilized in the present market\nmanagement systems (MMS) and energy management systems (EMS) [20]. Operation schedules are\ngenerally determined at day-ahead time stages, ignoring the effect of real-time adjustment which can\ncompensate for uncertainties and forecast errors of REG [21,22]. Day-ahead scheduling is performed,\nwhich is based on short-term forecasts of REG and load demands. However, because of the stochastic\nfluctuation attributes in wind strength, illumination intensity, etc., it is difficult to make accurate short-term\npredictions for PV and WT power and load demands.\nFor reducing the impact of renewable energy sources which are connected to power systems,\nthe two-stage optimal scheduling method has been presented by some scholars in recent years.\nFor example, there is the disturbance of power systems caused by the randomness and volatility\nof wind power, which can be reduced by a two-stage dynamic scheduling method, as noted in\nReference [23]. In addition, a two-stage optimal scheduling method for micro-grid economy is\npresented in Reference [24]. In the first stage, based on the real-time forecast data for future power,\noptimal management for power source in a micro-grid is able to be calculated. In the second stage,\naccording to the limitation of diesel generator output which can be figured out before, the output of\ndiesel generators is adjusted for improving the robustness of the system. The dispatch schedule is made\nin day-ahead for seawater pumped storage and renewable energy has not yet utilized their potential\ncapabilities to increase the performances and economics of active distribution networks adequately.\nCompared to short-term forecasts, ultra-short forecasts for PV and WT power is quite accurate. Based\non the ultra-short forecasts information, real-time scheduling for seawater pumped storage can solve\nor mitigate the negative impacts caused by forecast errors effectively. In this paper, a two-stage\nscheduling method is proposed, because it has high computation efficiency and takes advantages\nof the flexibility of seawater pumped storage and flexible loads to dispatch the active distribution\nnetworks. In a day-ahead scheduling stage, optimal dispatch schedule of active distribution networks\nis determined. In a real-time scheduling stage, negative impacts of forecast errors of REG on the\noperation of active distribution networks is compensated and mitigated.\nMain contributions are as follows.\ni. Variable speed seawater pumped storage is first utilized for dispatch in offshore local active\ndistribution networks in China;\nii. A two-stage scheduling method considering variable speed seawater pumped storage, flexible\nloads, and REG in active distribution networks is presented. Both advantages of day-ahead\nand real-time scheduling are fully utilized and exploited.\n213\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2014\nRemaining sections are organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the dispatch model for variable\nspeed seawater pumped storage. Section 3 presents the problem formulation of the two-stage\nscheduling in active distribution networks and the solving algorithm. Section 4 gives the test results of\nthe proposed approach on a modified Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 33-bus\ndistribution system. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 5.\n2. Variable Speed Seawater Pumped Storage Model\nThe structure of a traditional pumped storage station consists of a generator unit, pumping\nstation, and upper and lower reservoirs. Capacities of the upper and lower reservoirs are mainly\ndetermined by the conditions of natural water resources. However, for a variable speed seawater\npumped storage station, one of the prominent features is that the lower reservoir is the sea. Its water\nresources are unlimited and its capacity can be considered infinitely large. Only the water amount\nof the upper reservoir should be considered in the optimal scheduling. Another prominent feature\nis that the speed of the motor rotor in generating or pumping mode can vary within a large range.\nTherefore, the efficiency of the overall system can be improved in the generating mode. In the pumping\nmode, the range of input power is expanded. From the point of view of scheduling, the above features\ncan gain great benefits for the operation of the power system. Operation models of a variable speed\nseawater pumped storage station in generating and pumping modes are expressed as follows.\n2.1. Generating and Pumping Modes\nIn the generating mode, output power is formulated by:\nPg(t) = kg\u03c1gh \u00d7\n\u222b t\nt\u22121\nqg(\u03c4)d\u03c4 (1)\nIn the pumping mode, energy for the pump is directly input from local active distribution\nnetworks. The flow rate of seawater sucked from the sea is stated as follows.\n\u222b t\nt\u22121\nqp(\u03c4)d\u03c4 =\nkpPp(t)\n\u03c1gh\n(2)\n2.2. Operation and Maintenance Cost of Seawater Pumped Storage\nSeawater contains high salinity and corrosiveness to pipelines, which increases the maintenance\ncost of pipelines. Therefore, the cost of seawater pumped storage contains the installation fee, start-up\ncost, pipelines, and generator maintenance cost. Equation (3) is the operation and maintenance\ncost of seawater pumped storage; Equations (4) and (5) are the start-up cost of a turbine generator\nand pump-motor unit in period t, respectively; Equation (6) is the maintenance cost of turbine\ngenerator and pump-motor unit in period t; Equation (7) is the piping maintenance cost of the seawater\npumped storage.\nCsea(t) = Ccrg (t) + C\ncr\np (t) + C\nin\nsea(t) + C\nrun\nsea (t) (3)\nCcrg (t) = Cg \u00d7 \u03bcg(t)\u00d7 [1 \u2212 \u03bcg(t \u2212 1)] (4)\nCcrp (t) = Cp \u00d7 \u03bcp(t)\u00d7 [1 \u2212 \u03bcp(t \u2212 1)] (5)\nCinsea(t) = [\ncazsea\n8760\u03c4sea\nrsea(1 + rsea)\nnsea\n(1 + rsea)\nnsea \u2212 1 + \u03bb\nco\nsea][Pg(t) + Pp(t)] (6)\nCrunsea (t) = \u03bb\nrun\ng Pg(t) + \u03bb\nrun\np Pp(t) (7)\n214\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2014\n2.3.

Problem Formulation\nDue to the stochastic fluctuation attributes in wind strength and illumination intensity, people\u2019s\nability to predict REG power output accurately has yet to be improved. Ultra-short forecasting of REG\nare far more accurate than short-term\u2019s. Day-ahead scheduling of variable speed seawater pumped\nstorage is performed based on the short-term forecast information of REG power and load demands.\nThe objective of this stage is to minimize total system operation cost. Then real-time scheduling of\nvariable speed seawater pumped storage is carried out based on ultra-short forecast information to\nmitigate the negative effects of the forecast errors on the operation of active distribution networks [25].\n3. Optimal Scheduling Model\n3.1. Day-Ahead Scheduling\n3.1.1. Objective Function\nThe objective of day-ahead scheduling is to make the most cost-effective operation schedule\nfor active distribution networks. Costs of power obtained from main grid, penalty for the transition\nbetween generating and pumping modes of seawater pump storage, interruption, and incentive to\nthe flexible loads are all taken into consideration. We assume that all renewable energy sources are\nabsorbed. Therefore the costs of wind and solar energy power generation are neglected. These costs\nare induced by operation, maintenance, and depreciation.\nObjective function is as follows.\nminFDay =\nT\n\u2211\nt=1\n[PGrid(t)\u00d7 \u03a9(t) + Csea(t) + Cload(t)] (20)\nCload(t) = f c(t) + f e(t) (21)\nfc(t) =\nM\n\u2211\ni=1\nuc(i, t)[\u03b11 \u00d7 P2c (i, t) + \u03b12 \u00d7 Pc(i, t)\u2212 \u03b12 \u00d7 Pc(i, t)\u00d7 kc(i) (22)\nfe(t) =\nN\n\u2211\nj=1\nue(j, t)[\u03b21 \u00d7 P2e (j, t) + \u03b22 \u00d7 Pe(j, t)\u2212 \u03b22 \u00d7 Pe(j, t)\u00d7 ke(j) (23)\n3.1.2.

Real-Time Scheduling\n3.2.1. Objective Function\nThe day-ahead scheduling is seen as the foundation for real-time scheduling. However,\nthe forecast data is gotten in day-ahead, which cause a large forecast error. As a result, the reliability\nof distribution network operation could be influenced if the forecast error cannot be compensated\nin the real-time stage. So we assume that the forecast error of renewable energy is suppressed by\nseawater pumped storage in priority at real-time stage. The detail objective function for real-time\noptimal scheduling is shown as Equation (30).\nminFReal =\nT\u2032\n\u2211\nt=1\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u0394Pg(t) + \u0394Pp(t) +\nNWT\n\u2211\ni=1\n\u0394PWT(t) +\nNPV\n\u2211\ni=1\n\u0394PPV(t)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 (30)\n3.2.2.

Power flow results of voltage magnitudes in peak load period.\nAs shown in Figure 4, results showed that by applying the proposed model, not only did the\nmaximum exchange power between local active distribution networks and main grid decrease about\n25%, but also the maximum rate of power change was effectively reduced. Peak loads from 11:00 to\n15:00 and from 19:00 to 21:00 were successfully shifted and maximum power was reduced. Valley\nloads from 1:00 to 8:00 were effectively filled, and minimum valley loads increased by about eight\ntimes. In Table 3, the electricity price on the open market was high from 11:00 to 15:00 and from 19:00\nto 21:00, and was low from 24:00 to 7:00. As shown in Figure 5, flexible loads and seawater pumped\nstorage could respond to the price and coordinate their power to reduce total operation cost. Power\ndemands of flexible loads increased about 30% at low electricity price from 24:00 to 7:00, and decreased\nabout 40% at high electricity price from 11:00 to 15:00 and from 19:00 to 21:00.\nBased on the specific power system structure, power flow calculation was implemented. Periods\nduring peak loads were taken as an example. As shown in Figure 6, utilizing the proposed methods,\nexcept for voltage magnitudes at nodes 1 to 2 and 19 to 22 which did not increase, voltage magnitudes\nat nodes 3 to 18 and 23 to 33 increased. This proves that the power quality of the active distribution\nnetworks were effectively improved by using the proposed method. In Table 5, cost of purchase power\nfrom the main grid and network energy loss are compared. Cost of purchase power from the main grid\n221\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2014\ndecreased from \u00a5146,915 to \u00a5131,886 by 10.2%.

Real-time optimization results of seawater pumped storage.\nIn the simulation, average execution time for day-ahead scheduling was 3.6 min and for real-time\nscheduling it was 19.6 s. As a result, the proposed model can be applied online for active distribution\nnetworks. Applying the proposed strategy, the overall economic benefits for active distribution\nnetworks can be promoted in the day-ahead scheduling stage. Negative influence of the forecast errors\non the operation of active distribution networks can be minimized in the real-time scheduling stage.\nAs a consequence, reserve capacity for synchronous generators in the main grid and regulation burden\nfor automatic generation control (AGC) can be reduced.\n5. Conclusions\nThis paper has presented a two-stage optimal scheduling model for active distribution network\nintegration of seawater pumped storage stations, flexible loads, and renewable energy. ILOG Cplex 12.7\nwas called to solve the proposed model. In addition, the model was successfully tested in a modified\nIEEE 33-bus. Numerical results demonstrated that by applying the proposed methods in the day-ahead\nscheduling stage, total operation cost and the network power loss of active distribution networks could\nbe reduced. At the same time, peak loads were shifted. In a real-time scheduling stage, the negative\neffects of forecast errors of renewable energy on the operation of active distribution networks were\n223\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2014\ncompensated and alleviated by proper coordination of a seawater pumped storage station.

Mainly, the householders are becoming more and more\nactive and interested in diminishing their expenses related to the electricity consumption, considering\ndifferent rates of the advanced tariffs. Therefore, in the smart grid context, especially for prosumers\nwith energy sources and storage devices (SD), the electricity consumption optimization becomes\nattractive since they obtain significant benefits. On the other hand, the electricity suppliers design\nappropriate tariffs in order to reduce the consumption peaks and avoid the occurrence of new peaks.\nBased on the effect of these tariffs on consumers\u2019 behavior, the stress on generators decreases and\nthe electricity suppliers improve the demand forecast and adjust their strategies on the market. In\naddition, the grid operators are interested in the minimization of the consumption peak that leads\nto loss reduction and avoidance of congestions that would ensure at least the delay of the onerous\ninvestment in grid capacities. In this paper, we will run several scenarios for electricity consumption\noptimization in the context of smart grid that includes: sensors, actuators, smart meters, advanced\ntariff schemes, smart appliances and electricity home control applications. Our goal is to analyze\nthe effect of the Renewable Energy Systems (RES) distributed generation (such as photovoltaic\npanels\u2014PV) and storage on the consumption curve. The results show that consumption optimization\nwith RES distributed generation and SD brings sustainable development of the power systems and\nsignificant benefits from the consumption peak and savings point of view.\nKeywords: distributed generation; storage device; MILP; ToU tariff; optimization; daily consumption\ncurve; peak/off-peak; programmable appliances\n1. Introduction\nLately, more and more authorities of the countries from the European Union (EU) are concerned\nabout issues regarding the requirements of moving away from an economy driven by fossil fuels, based\non a centralized, supply-side approach, relying on old technologies and outdated business models, as it\nhas been emphasized by the European Community Energy Union Package 2015 [1]. In order to fulfill\nthis requirement, one of the most important steps that need to be taken consists in implementing the\nadvancements in smart grid technologies that enable various options and strategies for consumption\noptimization in electricity markets. However, there are still barriers for the widespread adoption of\nsmart grid technologies at the EU level, as emphasized by the European Technology and Innovation\nPlatform\u2014Smart Networks for Energy Transition, in the document Final 10-year ETIP SNET R&I\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2264; doi:10.3390/su10072264 www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability227\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2264\nRoadmap (2017\u201326) [2]. Embracing the same approach, the European Network of Transmission System\nOperators for Electricity highlights the need to activate the demand as a new source/tool for system\noperation and to integrate it in the planning and operation stages and market design in ENTSO/E R&I\nRoadmap 2017\u20132026 [3]. In Ireland, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), the regulator for\nthe natural gas and electricity sector, has initiated in 2007 the Smart Metering Project within which it\nhas performed rigorous benchmark tests in order to evaluate the performance characteristics of the\nsmart metering devices, analyzing their influence in regard to consumers, energy consumption, tariff\nschemes and economic aspects in view of implementing these devices at a national level [4].\nStarting from the interested parties in the consumption optimization, different approaches can\nbe envisioned. On one hand, the optimization can lead to minimization of the electricity payment\n(the consumers\u2019 approach), by shifting their appliances to the cheapest time intervals. On the other\nhand, it can lead to minimization of the consumption peak (the grid operators\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 approach)\nthat means the peaks are shaved and valleys are filled by uniformly distributing the programmable\nappliances on top of the fixed consumption. Both approaches require careful analyses and comparisons\nin order to reach a sustainable power systems development.\nFrom these perspectives, the consumers can be stimulated to change their behavior that leads to\nhigher demand response and electricity consumption reduction. In this respect, the advanced tariff\nscheme provides incentives for optimal planning of the appliances. In this way, according to the\nliterature, the consumers can save up to 50% of electricity payment due to the fact that off-peak tariff\nrate can be one third of the peak tariff rate [5]. Moreover, indirect savings are coming from less grid\ninvestments and reduction of losses, therefore achieving a smoother operation of generators that have\nthe possibility to operate closer to their optimum capacity.\nFrom the demand point of view, the electricity supply does not allow interruptions or massive\nstorage, therefore knowing the consumers\u2019 behavior is significant for grid operators, electricity\nproducers and suppliers. The system operator will dispatch the generators so that the demand\nis optimally supplied by the available generators based on the existing market mechanism. The grid\noperators will plan the grid capacity based on the consumption requirements, the suppliers will\nestimate the consumption level at any time and buy or sell on the various electricity markets while the\ngenerators will be prepared to produce the necessary energy as to satisfy the demand. Consequently,\nthe predictability of electricity consumption is one of the key factors that influence the sustainable\ndevelopment of power systems.\nMoreover, the consumption curve flattening creates the premises for important improvements,\nby reducing the stress on the generation units and on the entire grid, by diminishing the electricity price,\nby increasing the potential to achieve an accurate forecast and even by improving the market strategies.\nThe consumption peak has direct impact on grid loading, therefore by shaving the peaks and filling\nthe valleys, the grid will load uniformly during the 24 h of the day and onerous investments in grid\ninfrastructure can be eliminated or at least diminished. Furthermore, by using smart grid technologies,\nespecially smart metering systems and home control applications, the volume of investments in grid\nfacilities can be diminished by reducing the consumption peak and integrating a higher volume of\nRES distributed generation. Therefore, if the consumption peak is reduced by means of optimization\nand the electricity is locally generated, then less grid infrastructure will be needed. Consequently,\nthe analyzed issues have been addressed extensively in the scientific literature due to their significant\nand ever-increasing importance.\nFor example, the purpose of the study conducted in [6] consists in developing a solution that is able\nto manage optimally the battery storage at a large-scale level using a three-layer battery hierarchical\ncontrol structure by taking into consideration specific control circuits. The authors propose models\nfor the photovoltaics, storage batteries and supercapacitors for developing a distribution network\nstructure that offers the possibility of hierarchical storage. In order to regulate the high and low\nfrequency photovoltaic fluctuations the authors implement a low pass filter. After having performed\na series of simulation tests, the authors state that the obtained results confirm the supercapacitor\u2019s\n228\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2264\nand the battery\u2019s control effect. The authors acknowledge the fact that supplementary experiments\nmust be performed in order to check the efficiency of the control when there are considered several\ndistributed storage systems.\nIn the paper [7], the authors propose an Energy Scheduling and Distributed Storage (ESDS)\nalgorithm in view of installing it into the smart meter devices that have the capacity to record the\ndetailed Time of Use (TOU) consumption. The proposed algorithm aims to minimize the electricity\nconsumption of the consumer while increasing his satisfaction towards his electricity needs in the same\ntime. In this purpose, the authors have used the ESDS algorithm in three scenarios: in the first scenario\nthey have analyzed the case in which there was not considered the Demand Side Management (DSM),\nin the second scenario the authors have taken into consideration the DSM without ESDS, while in the\nthird scenario they have considered DSM with ESDS. The authors\u2019 obtained results confirmed that\nscenario 3 registered the highest level of performance with regard to the energy and financial savings,\nminimizing the dissatisfaction of consumers during peak periods, reducing the Peak-to-Average-Ratio\ndemand, the sustainability of the energy grid, a series of socio-economic and environmental benefits.\nIn their future work, the authors intend to analyze the possibility to adapt their algorithm so that it\ncan be implemented in the case of large non-household consumers.\nRelated to the above-mentioned case of large non-household consumers, a study that takes them\ninto account is [8], a paper in which a part of our research team has developed solutions regarding the\nhourly forecasting of the energy consumption, situation in which the accurate electricity consumption\nis extremely important due to the implied costs. The authors have developed several forecasting\nsolutions consisting in a series of artificial neural networks based on the non-linear autoregressive\n(NAR) model and the non-linear autoregressive with exogenous inputs (NARX) one, trained using\nthe Levenberg-Marquardt, Bayesian Regularization and Scaled Conjugate Gradient algorithms. In the\nstudy, the authors have used large datasets recorded by the smart metering devices of the consumer,\nalong with exogenous variables in the case of the NARX model, case in which the authors have\nbuilt meteorological and time stamp datasets. By means of extensive experimental tests, the authors\nhave identified in each case the best mix between the training algorithm, the number of neurons in\nthe hidden layer and the delay parameter. Based on a series of forecasting scenarios, using specific\nperformance metrics, the developed solutions for the hourly consumption energy prediction have\noffered a high level of forecasting accuracy, having the potential to become useful tools for both the\nelectricity producers and consumers. The authors consider that the further step of their research\nconsists in refining the study regarding the consumption forecasting up to the individual appliances or\ndevices level.\nPaper [9] describes a method based on a hybrid energy storage system designed to smooth\nthe fluctuating output of a photovoltaic power plant. The Renewable Energy Systems distributed\ngeneration (PV) and the hybrid energy storage systems have been modeled in Matlab/Simulink and\nPiecewise Linear Electrical Circuit Simulation software environment. Using a series of extensive\nsimulations, the authors confirm the effectiveness of their proposed approach for the power control\nstrategy. In [10], the authors propose a three-layer management system designed to handle the\nissues raised by large capacity energy storage batteries. The authors discuss the hardware and\nsoftware implementations of the Battery Management Unit, Battery Cluster Management System\nand Battery Array Management System, considered as bottom, middle and respectively top layers\nof the proposed hierarchical management system that is useful in performing a variety of tasks\nsuch as: measurement and computation, balance of cells, the safe management of high voltage, data\nmanagement, the management of the charging and discharging operations, issuing warnings.\nThe authors of [11] propose a model for optimizing the operation of a micro-grid, taking\ninto account the distributed generation, the environmental factors as well as the demand response.\nAccording to the authors, the main advantages of the devised model consists in cutting down the\noperational costs at the micro-grid level, without affecting the consumers, therefore creating the\npremises of consuming clean energy. The authors\u2019 approach consists in employing a genetic algorithm\n229\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2264\nfor implementing the objective function and a demand response scheduling strategy. The validation of\nthe model was done on a smart micro-grid from Tianjin. The authors state that the obtained results\nhighlight the strong effect that the distributed generation and the demand response have on the micro-\ngrid operation from the economical point of view. In the paper, there are also analyzed the main factors\nthat impact the optimization results, concluding that the price of the natural gas has the most important\ninfluence on the micro-grid\u2019s operation costs and the demand response. The authors conclude that\ntheir model has the potential to be implemented in a real production working environment and that\nthey intend to do so in their future researches.\nThe volatility of the PV output influences to a great extent the stability and the power quality of\nthe PV systems, causing difficulties regarding the grid integration of PV systems. In order to address\nthese issues, the authors of [12] have developed a control strategy based on energy storage systems\nin order to attenuate the generation fluctuations of the PV system and the impact of the PV systems\nto the grid. The active energy flow between the grid and the storage systems is ensured through the\nusage of bidirectional converters, a battery and ultracapacitors, the direct current constant voltage\nis maintained using an inverter control strategy, the photovoltaic system is managed as to provide\nthe maximum power. In order to confirm the efficiency of their proposed model, the authors devise a\ndynamic modeling approach and a simulation study developed using Matlab/Simulink.\nIn the paper [13], the authors investigate the feasibility of replacing the autonomous thermal\npower plants that exist on a small Greek island with distributed energy resources that derive from RES,\nusing also modern storage technologies. This replacement is very important in order to solve many of\nthe problems that electricity autonomous islands have to deal with on a daily basis, for example energy\nand water shortages. In their study, the authors have chosen as main objectives the minimization of\ncosts, of carbon dioxide emissions and the reliability maximization of the distributed energy resources.\nIn order to conduct the multi-objective analysis, the authors have used a decision support tool,\nthe Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model, that implements mathematical software\ndesigned to find the optimal solutions. After analyzing the obtained results, the authors propose a\nsolution for all the investors that are interested in implementing the proposed approach in the case of\nother autonomous islands that deal with similar issues. The authors conclude that the development of\nthe distributed energy resources has the potential to bring numerous advantages to the consumers:\nEnergy independence, increased quality of the delivered electricity, stability of the electricity dispatch\nsystem along with economic benefits resulting from the local business.\nThe paper [14] proposes a reclosing method for distribution systems in the case when the\ndistributed generation and the battery storage system are employed. The system also contains a\ncircuit breaker in the distribution line. The method proposed in this paper is based on a model that\nuses an electromagnetic transient program. The authors have performed a series of simulations, which\nreflect the capacities of the distributed generation and the clearance time of the faults. The authors\nacknowledge that their proposed method has two limitations, the first one being related to the cost\nand the second one to the type of the distributed generation. As regarding the costs, they represent a\nlimitation of the proposed method because of the circuit breakers and the communication\u2019s electrical\ninstallation that both must be installed. The limitation regarding the distributed generation\u2019s type\nis also worth to be considered, as in their study the authors have taken into account a photovoltaic\nsystem, connected through an inverter. If a system that employs a synchronous generator is used\ninstead of this type of distributed generation, then the devised method does not provide satisfactory\nresults. Therefore, the authors state that in a future work they intend to address the above-mentioned\nlimitations of the method by taking into consideration the economic aspects and also the type of the\ndistributed generation.\nIn the paper [15], the authors devise a simulation model of a hybrid renewable energy system\ngeneration that comprises also an energy storage system, targeting several households that have an\nannual electricity demand of 30 MWh. The authors state that the obtained results reveal that an energy\nstorage system comprising a 9 kW PV array, an 8 kW wind turbine, a 2 kW water turbine as well as a\n230\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2264\n256 kWh storage capacity for the energy storage system can be a sustainable and reliable energy source,\ncovering the needs of entire families. After having performed the simulations, the authors acknowledge\nthat the households still have to be connected to the electricity grid taking into consideration the\nirregular intervals of occurrences that characterize the energy sources of the system, otherwise there is\na risk of energy surpluses if the system is oversized or a risk of having an energy deficit. The authors\nalso acknowledge the fact that achieving a proper sizing of the energy storage system as to cover\nappropriately the seasonal and diurnal patterns of electricity generation and demand is a complex\ntask and emphasize that the model can be improved in the future if one takes into consideration the\neconomic and environmental aspects of the hybrid energy sources.\nThe authors of [16] develop a multi-sensor system for a smart home environment by incorporating\ntechnology from wearables along with artificial intelligence positioning algorithms and multiple\nsensors for data fusion. The developed system allows one to operate household appliances remotely,\nallows the smart home environment to be aware of the residents\u2019 indoor position and the environment\nof each living space to be monitored in order to assure automated household appliance control,\nenhance home security and ultimately achieve a smart energy management. The authors state that\nthe experimental results depicted an accuracy for the 3D gesture recognition algorithm in view of\noperating remotely the appliances ranging from 87.7% to 92.0% while for the positioning within the\nbuilding and the smart energy management, the accuracy concerning the distance and the positioning\nwas around 0.22% and 3.36% of the total distance that was traveled indoors. The authors stated that\nthey intend in future studies to reduce the size of the wearable sensor as to increase the comfort level\nfor the residents and make use of multiple positioning methods, like WiFi and Beacon systems to\nrefine the accuracy of positioning along with developing a more practical and user-friendly monitoring\ninterface on a smartphone device.\nAnother study that tackles issues regarding the smart homes and the household appliances is [17],\nwhere a part of our research team has developed and applied a method for the accurate forecasting\nof the residential consumption of electricity up to the appliance level. The authors have used data\nrecorded by the sensors of the smart homes from residential area, characterized by the fact that they\nare equipped with solar panels able to sustain a part of the consumed energy. The main difficulties and\nlimitations in developing this research consisted in the fact that historical meteorological data were not\navailable and even if they had been, they would have imposed supplementary costs, as in the future\nthe beneficiary of the forecast had to acquire from time to time accurate forecasts for a short-term\nhorizon from a meteorological institute. In order to overcome all these limitations, the authors have\ndeveloped an approach based on a mix of non-linear autoregressive with exogenous inputs artificial\nneural networks and function fitting neural networks. The method represents a useful tool to the\ncontractors and it also has the potential to be incorporated in a cloud solution, in order to be offered\nas a service to both the operators and the consumers, for a monthly fee. As regarding future work,\nthe authors consider that their method could be refined by taking into consideration the energy class of\nthe appliances, the number, structure and behavioral patterns of the households\u2019 inhabitants, by using\nfuture versions of the development environment and by improving the retraining process.\nIn [18], the authors develop an approach based on game theory in order to achieve an appropriate\nbalancing electricity consumption within clustered wireless sensor networks. In the approach,\nthe authors have modified the payoff function by including a penalty system within it in order\nfor the nodes that contain a higher amount of energy to be able to strive more vigorously for the\ncluster head. The authors state that they have employed convex optimization techniques in order to\nachieve for the clustering game the Nash equilibrium strategy. Due to the devised strategy, the authors\nmade sure that every sensor node has the possibility to attain the highest possible payoff when the\ndecision is taken. After having performed numerous simulations, the authors conclude that their\ndeveloped approach achieves a good performance concerning the energy balance, therefore extending\nthe lifetime of the network to a great extent. The authors state that in the future they intend to approach\nissues regarding the multi-hop clustered wireless sensor networks, the cluster head selection in energy\n231\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2264\nharvesting wireless sensor networks and finally to tackle the security issues that arise in clusters that\nare based on wireless sensor networks.\nThe authors of [19] conduct a study that has as a main goal to assess the benefits that can be\nobtained after having peak shaved the demand response considering in their study different storage\ndevices such as capacitors, magnetic storage, different types of batteries, flywheel, compressed air and\npumped hydro. In order to generate randomly the electricity demand profiles at the appliance level\nfor a typical household from the United States, the authors employed an agent-based stochastic model.\nThe authors used the total-energy-throughput lifetime in order to introduce a storage cost model on\nseveral levels and afterwards they have tried to optimize both the electricity storage capacity and the\nlimit concerning the demand by devising a strategy that dispatches the stored energy appropriately.\nThe authors found out that the storage devices bring benefits, the annual profit of the demand response\nmechanism varying from 1 to 39% when compared to the previous period. The authors acknowledge\nthat in the future an even higher profit rate can be obtained if one incorporates in the dispatch strategy\nweather forecasting aspects.\nIn the paper [20], the authors analyze a solution based on a battery energy storage system designed\nto shave the energy peaks and smooth the load curve, therefore improving the operation of a power\nsystem located in Hawaii, in the island of Maui. As the distribution circuit is mainly based on the\nphotovoltaic generation, a series of issues regarding the renewable energy integration are posed to the\noperator of the power system, principally due to the transmission system. In order to approach this\nissue, the authors have proposed two methods for obtaining the load forecasting that is mandatory\nin order to employ safely at its maximum capacity the battery energy storage system and to achieve\nthe shaving of the energy peaks and the smoothing of the load curve. The first method is based on a\nnonlinear programming technique, while the second one employs a control strategy in real time that\noffers the possibility to achieve simultaneously the two proposed targets (shaving of the energy peaks\nand smoothing of the load curve). In order to confirm the usefulness and accuracy of their forecasting\nmethods, the authors benchmark their methods using a real case study, comprising data collected for\n108 days.\nIn [21], the authors propose an energy management system for residential consumers, taking into\naccount in the same time the energy that has been consumed and the one that has been generated. The\nsystem is based on the electricity price that motivates the consumers to reschedule their appliances\nso that to benefit from the price variation. The approach is analyzed considering a smart home with\nmodern appliances, micro wind power plant, PV and batteries as storage device for a period covering\n24 h. The authors have used a series of scenarios in order to evaluate their proposed model and\nafterwards they have analyzed and compared the obtained results, highlighting situations in which\na consumer has to buy, use, store or even sell the available amount of electricity, therefore obtaining\nan improved efficiency and economic benefits. Based on the obtained results, the authors state that\nthe scheduling of the electrically controllable appliances, thermostatically controllable appliances and\noptically controllable appliances can be done in the same time, therefore obtaining a viable solution for\nthe management of residential electricity usage.\nThe authors of [22] propose an optimization model for residential consumption by shaving the\npeaks and filling the gaps of the load curve. The authors state that the developed method is useful\nin reducing the production cost of the energy at peak hours and in increasing the income at off-peak\nhours. For this purpose, the demand response program is based on rewards for load control. Therefore,\nthe authors implemented a credit function within their model to influence the consumption level\nand provide incentives to consumers as to attain the desired load curve. After having performed\nsimulations, the authors state that the best approach to reduce the electricity costs is to use the\nappliances that consume the highest amount of electricity only during the dawn, the midday or the\nnight. The authors consider that if their method would be accepted and enforced by policy makers at\nthe global level, one would achieve clean energy generation. In their future work, the authors intend\n232\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2264\nto adjust the model as to use a multi-objective non-linear approach, to optimize the parameters of the\nutility function as to be related to the focus of the objective one.\nAn extensive literature review related to consumption peak shaving is proposed in [23] analyzing\nthe effect of the following strategies for peak load shaving: Integration of energy storage systems,\nintegration of electric vehicles to grid, demand side management. The paper analyzes in each of the\nthree cases, the possible benefits brought by the peak shaving to both the supplier and the consumer,\nthe main challenges that must be overcome, the future research directions that have to be approached\nin view of achieving a proper peak load shaving, the main technologies used for energy storage in\nthe purpose of peak shaving, the operation of the energy storage systems, their management and\nappropriate sizing, the methods for peak shaving in the case of electric vehicles. As a limitation of\ntheir paper, the authors mention the fact that they have not analyzed in detail the aspect of using a mix\nof multiple RES when performing the peak shaving.\nTaking into account the ever-growing importance of the consumption optimization process, our\npaper aims to reveal the effect of the PV and SD on the load curve, emphasizing the impact on\nconsumption peak and electricity payment. Consequently, we develop a set of sensors based on\nArduino for monitoring and controlling household appliances and analyze the simulation results of\ntwo optimization approaches with different objective functions that provide significant insights on PV\nand SD benefits.\nThis paper is structured in four sections. In the current section, the importance of consumption\ncurve flattening, a series of related works and the structure of the paper are presented. In the\nsecond section, we propose an optimization method and design the required architecture for its\nimplementation, describe the appliances considered in the optimization process and describe the\nobjective functions implemented in Matlab R2016a by means of intlinprog and fminimax functions. The\nconsumer preferences are configured in terms of hourly and daily consumption of each appliance. Also,\nwe formalize de optimization problem, by setting the variables, constraints and objective functions:\nconsumption peak minimization and electricity payment minimization. In the third section several\nsimulations have been performed underlying the two optimization approaches, using six three-level\nToU tariffs. Also, intlinprog and fminimax functions are also compared in terms of optimization results\nand we analyze the effect of the PV and SD on the consumption curve; both the consumption peak and\nelectricity payment decreased. In section four, the main conclusions based on the simulation findings\nare presented. However, our approach has several limitations and policy implications that are also\npresented in the conclusion section.\n2. Method and Objective Functions\nOur optimization method aims to provide an efficient solution for minimization the consumption\npeak and payment by integrating the PV and SD. The method consists in several steps that allow\nus to configure the appliances, to set up the sensors for monitoring and controlling their operation,\nperform consumption peak minimization and payment minimization with two optimization functions\n(intlinprog and fminimax implemented in Matlab), compare the results and choose the best option in\nterms of objective function. Then, peak minimization is performed with intlinprog, adding PV and SD\nto analyze their effect on the consumption curve. These steps are briefly illustrated in Figure 1.\n233\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2264\nAppliances classification \nPeak min: intlinprog Peak min: fminimax \nAnalyze results and choose objective \nfunction \nProvide ToU \nPayment minimization \nAdd PV & SD \nPeak minimization with PV & SD \nAnalyze results and provide the appliances\u2019 scheduler \nSet up sensors for monitoring and control \nApply optimization models  \nFigure 1. Flowchart of the proposed method.\nThe method is implemented on an architecture that consists in: Arduino-based sensors for\nmonitoring and controlling the appliances; a relational database running Oracle Database 12c for\nstoring the appliances consumption data, electricity tariffs and the scheduler for each programmable\nappliance that provides the start and operation interval based on the optimization results; a set of\noptimization models developed in Matlab R2016a based on two functions: intlinprog and fminimax.\nThe electricity supplier provides ToU tariff, while the consumers provide appliances constraints and\ndesired operational schedule via portal developed in JDeveloper.

The architecture for implementing the optimization method.\nThe controlling and surveillance solution of the appliances has components for collecting and\nreceiving data among appliances and the gateway with two parts: Transmitter and receiver. For\ntransmitter, Micro Arduino with ATmega32U4 microcontroller with 20 digital pins was used for\nI/O. It has an automatic voltage regulator, an oscillator, a micro USB connector, a serial circuit\nprogramming/an In-Circuit Serial Programming.\nAn YHDC SCT-013 current transformer based on AC current sensor of 100A max was connected\nto Micro Arduino for measuring the electricity consumption of the appliance (for instance a desk\nlamp). Against overloading, 1 \u00d7 220 \u03bcF capacitor and 2 \u00d7 330 Ohm resistors are also connected. In\nthe emergency cases, the Micro Arduino is energized by a battery with a capacity of 3000 mAh that is\nconnected to the micro USB charger. For controlling the consumption of the appliances, a relay with\noptocoupler is also connected to Micro Arduino.\nA transmitter-controlling device with relay is set up for each programmable appliance and\na transmitter-monitoring device for each non-programmable appliance. The receiver consists in\nRaspberry Pi that communicates with the transmitter component via a RF 433 MHz transmitter-receiver\nmodule. The transmitter-receiver components shown in Figure 3 are managed through a Node.js\napplication that passes the data inserting the records into an Oracle Database.\n  \n(a) (b) \nFigure 3. AC current sensor (a), transmitter-receiver components (b).\nAn ETL process is used for extracting (E), loading (L) and transforming (T) the input into valid\ndata. The process is implemented in Oracle PLSQL language and consists is several procedures and\n235\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2264\nfunctions that allow data validation and transformation. Data measured at one-minute intervals by AC\ncurrent sensors is validated first using ETL subroutines to check data consistency and replace missing\nvalues with average neighboring values. Then data is aggregated at hourly interval and loaded into\nthe Oracle Database tables for further evaluation and processing.\nIn Section 2.1 the appliances are classified and in Section 2.2 the objective functions are described\nin terms of variables and models.\n2.1. Appliances Description and Classification\nThe appliances can be classified based on their operation mode in relation with the electricity\nconsumers\u2019 interaction. From this point of view, three appliances categories are identified:\n\u2013 Background appliances are always or periodically in operation without notably intervention\nfrom consumers side (i.e., refrigerator, house monitoring system);\n\u2013 Active appliances require the presence of the consumers (i.e., vacuum, electric grill);\n\u2013 Passive appliances are started by consumers, but operate without assistance (i.e., washing\nmachine, bread oven).\nStarting from this classification, some appliances such as: refrigerator, lighting cannot be\nprogrammed due to the fact that the comfort of the consumer would be prejudiced. However,\nthe operation of other (programmable) appliances can be shifted to operate at lower tariff rate\nwithout any comfort prejudice. Some programmable appliances can be interrupted, while others\nare uninterruptible due to their intrinsic characteristics. Thus, for simulations, all types of appliances\nthat belong to regular residential consumers are taken into account. Therefore, adding, modifying\nor eliminating an appliance should be an easy task. Describing each appliance in terms of operation\nmode is essential in order to define the optimization problem.\nFor simulations performed in Matlab R2016a, we considered twelve modern appliances such\nas: Oven, heating, refrigerator, water heating, car battery, TV and speakers, washing machine, dish\nwasher, electric hob, lighting, vacuum and bread oven.\nThe operation period, hourly and daily consumption are required for setting the optimization\nproblem in terms of operation constraints, limits also known as lower/upper bounds and linear\nequations. In Table 1, operational mode of the twelve appliances in terms of operation time interval,\nhourly and daily consumption requirements is described.\nTable 1. Description of consumption requirements.\nNo. Appliance Name Consumption Requirements\n1 Oven Operation period: hour 20Hourly consumption: 1 kWh\n2 TV and speakers Operation period: hours 19\u201323Hourly consumption: 0.3 kWh\n3 Heating Operation period: hours 4\u20135 and 21\u201323Hourly consumption: 1 kWh\n4 Electric hob Operation period: hour 7Hourly consumption: 1 kWh\n5 Refrigerator Operation period: 24 hHourly consumption: 0.1 kWh\n6 Lighting Operation period: hours 6\u20138 and 19\u201323Hourly consumption: 0.11 kWh\n7 Water heater Hourly consumption: 0\u20131 kWhDaily consumption: 2.5 kWh\n236\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2264\nTable 1. Cont.\nNo. Appliance Name Consumption Requirements\n8 Car battery\nLoading period: hours 20\u20138\nPower: 0.05 kW\u20132 kW\nDaily consumption: 5 kWh\n9 Vacuum\nOperation between hours 6\u201318\nHourly consumption: 0.5 kWh\nDaily consumption: 0.5 kWh\n10 Washing machine\nUninterruptible operation twice a day\n1 kWh for first hour\n0.5 kWh for second hour\n11 Bread oven Operate 1 h/day, without interruptionsDaily consumption: 1 kWh\n12 Dish washer Hourly consumption: 1 kWhDailyconsumption: 1 kWh\nThe electricity consumers/prosumers become more and more involved in consumption\noptimization increasing the usage of the PV and SD due to their benefits in cutting-off the electricity\nbills. At off-peak/peak hours, SD can storage/supply the energy generated by PV, aiming to reduce\nboth the consumption peak and electricity payment.\nThe usage of batteries as SD are the most appropriate energy storage form at the consumers\u2019 level\n(also known as distributed storage), but the main problem consists in the efficiency of the successive\ncharging/discharging due to the fact that it may vary between 50% and 90%.\nAlso, the price for 1 kWh storage varies between 100 and 1050 Euro; the lifetime of the SD varies\nfrom 103 to 104 charging/discharging cycles. The efficiency of SD may vary between 72% and 100%\nbased on the SD type; the lifetime may also vary between 200 and 104 charging/discharging cycles.\nTherefore, it is difficult to estimate the feasibility investment in SD. However, this goal is beyond\nour scope that is to analyze the influence of PV and SD on the consumption curve.\nModeling PV takes into account the operating characteristics that are specific for solar-irradiance\nbased technology. Therefore, since PV generate depending of solar irradiance intensity, they have been\nconsidered to generate gradually between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m., the correlation coefficient between the\nsolar irradiance and PV output varying between 96 and 99%.\nStarting from the consumption requirements of the appliances, characteristics of PV, SD and\nelectricity consumers\u2019 preferences, in Section 4 we performed several simulations in Matlab R2016a.\n2.2. Objective Functions\nOur method consists in two optimization approaches: minimization of the consumption peak\n(suppliers, grid operators approach) and minimization of the electricity payment (consumers approach).\nFor these approaches, we provide the variables of the model and use two optimization functions\nimplemented in Matlab R2016a: intlinprog and fminimax.\nThe consumption of all home appliances (HA) for an hour h, \u2200h \u2208 {1, . . . , 24} should be less or\nequal to the objective function f (xh) that is first to minimize the peak accumulated hourly consumption\n(suppliers and grid operators approach).\nxh = \u2211\na\u2208HA\nxah \u2264 f (xh), \u2200h \u2208 {1, . . . , 24} (1)\nwhere: xh\u2014consumption of all home appliances (HA) for an hour h;\nxah\u2014consumption of appliance a at hour h;\nf (xh)\u2014objective function.\n237\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2264\nThe sum of hourly consumption of an appliance a represents the total daily consumption for a.\nRegardless the hourly operation schedule of an appliance a, its daily consumption remains the same.\n24\n\u2211\nh=1\nxah = Da, \u2200a \u2208 HA (2)\nwhere Da\u2014total daily consumption for appliance a.\nThe total consumer\u2019s daily consumption Tc is the sum of the daily consumption of each appliance\na. It remains constant after consumption optimization is implemented.\n\u2211\na\u2208HA\n24\n\u2211\nh=1\nxah = Tc (3)\nConsidering the different types of appliances (nonprogrammable np, programmable with\ninterruption pi and programmable without interruption pwi, a \u2208 {np, pi, pwi}), we need to define the\nrequirements for individual appliances and user preferences as supplementary constraints that are\npart of the optimization problem.\nFor a non-programmable appliance np with fixed operation requirements given by the consumer\u2019s\npreferences or intrinsic characteristics of the appliance, the consumption scheduling is fixed to a certain\ntime interval considering that hourly consumption cannot be shifted:\nxa = [Ca1, Ca2, . . . , Ca24 ]\nT , \u2200a \u2208 np (4)\nFixing the operation limits of np appliances can be done by setting the upper and lower bounds.\nIn this case, the consumer indicates the hourly consumption usually by setting the upper and lower\nbounds to the same value, imposing fixed consumption.\nFor a programmable appliance with interruption pi, the consumer predefines a certain\nconsumption schedule intervals that can be written as a vector, where only the starting time can\nbe optimized.\nxa = [Ca1, Ca2, . . . , Ca24 ]\nT , \u2200a \u2208 pi (5)\nTherefore, all possible operating combinations form a matrix that shows the programmable\noptions of appliance pi.\nXa =\n\u23a1\n\u23a2\u23a3\nCa1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Ca24\n...\n. . .\n...\nCa24 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Ca1\n\u23a4\n\u23a5\u23a6, \u2200a \u2208 pi (6)\nAnother vector is also defined by consumer in order to indicate possible starting time ST (in or\nnot in operation) for appliance pi.\nSTa = [STa1, STa2, . . . , STa24 ]\nT (7)\nwhere the sum of starting time for 24 h is equal to 1 multiplied by the number of operation times t\nper day, considering that the appliance is in operation at least once a day. Thus, in case the appliance\noperates only once a day, then t = 1.\n24\n\u2211\nh=1\nSTah = t (8)\nThe consumption of appliance pi can be obtained by multiplying the matrix of all possible\noperating combinations Xa by vector STa.\nxa = Xa \u00d7 STa, \u2200a \u2208 pi (9)\n238\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2264\nFor a programmable appliance without interruption pwi, we split their operation into distinct\nparts or tasks, such as: p1, p2, . . . , pj. For instance, in case of washing machine, we may assume\nthat first operation part is related to washing, while second part to rinsing and third part to drying.\nTherefore, the daily consumption Da of each appliance pwi is the sum of its parts:\nDa = xp1 + xp2 + . . . + xpj, \u2200a \u2208 pwi (10)\nAfter the division of pwi operation into distinct parts, each part of programmable appliance\nwithout interruption becomes a programmable appliance with interruption pi with its hourly\nconsumption requirement. Therefore, the consumption of part pj of an appliance pwi is:\nxpj = Xpj \u00d7 STpj, \u2200a \u2208 pwi, \u2200pj \u2208 a (11)\nwhere Xpj\u2014matrix of all possible operation combination of part pj;\nSTpj\u2014starting time of part pj.\nSimilar to (8), sum of starting time of each part pj for a certain hour h is equal to t.\n24\n\u2211\nh=1\nSTpjh = t, \u2200a \u2208 pwi, \u2200pj \u2208 a (12)\nHowever, the starting time of all parts pj should be less than or equal to 1 in order to ensure\nconsecutive operation of the different parts of the same appliance that cannot be interrupted.\n\u2211\npj\nSTpj \u2264 1, \u2200pj (13)\nSecond, the objective function is to minimize the electricity payment (consumers\u2019 approach). In\nthis case, the objective function p(x) is:\np(x) =\n24\n\u2211\nh=1\n(xah \u00d7 th) (14)\nwhere th\u2014time of use tariff vector.\nStorage device is considered either as consumer or generator; its operation constraints are\ndescribed in the following equations:\nEt+1SD = E\nt\nSD \u00d7 (1 \u2212 \u03c3) +\n(\nPSD,C \u00d7 \u03b7SD,C \u2212 PSD,D\u03b7SD,D\n)\n\u00d7 \u0394t (15)\n0 \u2264 PSD,C \u2264 PmaxSD,C (16)\n0 \u2264 PSD,D \u2264 PmaxSD,D (17)\nEminSD \u2264 EtSD \u2264 EmaxSD (18)\nwhere EtSD and E\nt+1\nSD represent the output of SD at t and t + 1;\n\u03c3 is the loss ratio;\nPSD,C is charging power of SD, PSD,D is discharging power of SD;\nPmaxSD,C is the maximum charging capacity, P\nmax\nSD,D is the maximum discharging capacity;\nEminSD and E\nmax\nSD represent the minimum and maximum output of SD;\n\u03b7SD,C and \u03b7SD,D represent the charging and discharging efficiency of the SD.\nTo avoid simultaneous charging/discharging, the following constraints have been added:\nIF PSD,C > 0 THEN PSD,D = 0 (19)\n239\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2264\nIF PSD,D > 0 THEN PSD,C = 0 (20)\nWhen considering PV and SD into the objective function, Equations (1) and (14) become:\n\u2211\na\u2208HA\nxah \u2212 EhPV + EhSD \u2264 f (xh), \u2200h \u2208 {1, . . . , 24} (21)\np(x) =\n24\n\u2211\nh=1\n(\nxah \u2212 EhPV + EhSD\n)\n\u00d7 th (22)\nwhere EhPV represents the output of PV at hour h;\nEhSD represents the output of SD at hour h;\nth\u2014time of use tariff vector.\nThe electricity consumption optimization is a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem\nbeing defined by: variables, objective function, lower/upper bounds and other constraints in terms\nof equations. MILP restricts the relaxed solution of the linear programming problem due to the fact\nthat part of variables should be integers. To solve the linear programming problem, we use intlinprog\noptimization function that can be modeled as:\nmin f (xh) or p(xh),\n\u23a7\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23aa\u23a9\nA \u00d7 xh \u2264 b\nAeq \u00d7 xh = beq\nlb \u2264 xh \u2264 ub\n(23)\nwhere:\n\u2022 f (xh) is hourly consumption of all appliances;\n\u2022 p(xh) is the hourly consumption multiplied by ToU tariff hourly rates;\n\u2022 A \u00d7 xh \u2264 b linear inequalities system. A\u2014k \u00d7 n matrix; k\u2014number of inequalities; n\u2014number of\nvariables; b\u2014k length vector;\n\u2022 Aeq\u00d7 xh = beq linear equations system. Aeq\u2014m \u00d7 n matrix; m\u2014number of equations; n\u2014number\nof variables; beq\u2014m length vector;\n\u2022 lb \u2264 xh \u2264 ub each element of vector xh should be higher than a lower bond (lb) and lower than an\nupper bound (ub).\nFor building the optimization model, we follow the steps: Identifying variables, setting the\nobjective function, formulation of lower and upper bonds and definition of linear equations and\ninequalities systems. The intlinprog function requires the objective function modeling, setting the\ninteger variables, bounds and constraints: f, intcon, A, Aeq, b, beq, ub, lb.\n% intlinprog function call\n[x,fval,exitflag,output] = intlinprog(f,intcon,A,b,Aeq,beq,lb,ub)\nThe advantage of this function is that it allows the imposing of some integer variables that\ncharacterize the electricity consumption.\nThe second optimization function is fminimax that is based on reaching the goal, considering it as\ndaily average consumption. The problem of reaching the goal considering the minimization of the\nmaximum variable can be formulated as:\nminmax\nh\n( f (xh)\u2212 goal) = minmax\nh\n(\nf (xh)\u2212 Tc24\n)\n(24)\n3. Appliances Modeling and Optimization Results\nFirst approach is to minimize the consumption peak. At first sight, it may be unattractive for\nconsumers, but on long term it can sustainably reduce the electricity consumption payment due to the\nfact that by flattening the load curve overloading of the grids can be avoided. Second approach is to\n240\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2264\nminimize the electricity payment that will significantly modify the load curve, but not in the flattening\nway due to the fact that most of the consumers will change their behavior by consuming when tariff\nrates are lower. Therefore, it may lead to new peaks that impose the need for a new tariff scheme in\na chain reaction. After the new tariffs will be in force, the consumers again will tend to shift their\nappliances to operate at lower rates leading to other peaks that can be overcome only by new tariff\nschemes [24,25] that should discourage the consumption at peak hours.\nFor estimation of the payment, regardless the objective functions, we have considered a set of\nsix three-level times of use (ToU) tariffs as in Figure 4. They encourage the consumption during\nnight when the hourly rates are lower than the rates applied during the day. The implemented ToU\ntariffs ToU_B, ToU_C, ToU_D, and ToU_E are considered as in Irish Social Science Data Archive [4],\nwhile ToU_A and ToU_F are proposed by the authors considering the same rate structure as in [4] for\ntesting purposes. ToU_A has similar rates without significant differences among rates, characterized\nby mildest slopes, while ToU_F has the highest differences between peak and off-peak rates, with\nsharp slopes. Tariffs, that represent a vector of 24 values that correspond to the 24 h, can be easily\nreplaced with a more advanced tariff systems such as multiple-level ToU tariff, critical peak pricing\ntariff that is also based on different daily ToU tariffs or real-time tariff. The peak hours from the 1\u201324 h\nof the time intervals, 18 and 19 are the most expensive ones, while between 24\u20138, the electricity rate is\nless expensive.\n \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\nTariff A Tariff B Tariff C Tariff D Tarrif E Tariff F\nEU\nRO\n_C\nEN\nTS\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24\nFigure 4. Hourly electricity time of use tariffs.\nBefore optimization, the peak is 2.55 kWh and the electricity payment is between 3.34 \u20ac (with ToU\nB) and 3.72 \u20ac (ToU_A).\nThe optimization results in case the objective function is minimization of the consumption peak\nare shown in Figure 5 (cumulative consumption) and Figure 6 (individual consumption).\nThe consumption of individual appliances is uniformly distributed during the 24 h so that the\nconsumption peak is flattened based on the operation constraints of the programmable appliances\nand the consumer flexibility. Heating, car battery and water heater operate at night, due to the\nfact that they are programmable and do not involve consumer. In addition, the washing machine\nis programmed to operate in the afternoon even if the consumer is not at home. In the evening,\nnon-programmable appliances such as: TV, vacuum cleaner and electric oven usually operate as they\nrequire the involvement of the consumer. After the optimization function is applied, we obtain the\nhourly schedule for each appliance for the entire day as in Figure 6.\n241\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2264\n \nFigure 5. Daily consumption curve. Peak minimization with intlinprog.\n \nFigure 6. Individual consumption. Peak minimization with inlinprog.\nIn this scenario, the consumption peak is 1.56 kWh and the electricity payment varies between\n2.196 \u20ac (Tou_F) and 3.632 \u20ac (ToU_A). Comparing to \u201cwithout optimization case\u201d, the consumption peak\nreduces by around 39%, while the electricity payment reduces between 2.4% (ToU_A) and 31.1% (ToU_F).\nIn case the objective function is minimization of the electricity payment, the optimization results\nare presented in Figure 7 (cumulative consumption) and Figure 8 (individual consumption). Most of the\nappliances operate at lower tariff rate time intervals. Therefore, during the day only non-programmable\nappliances (such as refrigerator) operate. The consumption is moved from day and evening to night\nhours due to the ToU tariffs rates differences.\nThe consumption peak is 3 kWh and electricity payment is between 1.796 \u20ac (ToU_F) and 3.582 \u20ac\n(ToU_A). The peak consumption is almost double compared with the case when the objection function\nis minimization of the consumption peak. The electricity payment is less by 3.8% (ToU_A) and\n50.2% (ToU_F) than in the initial case. The peak consumption is even higher compared with the no\noptimization case. Therefore, this approach is just a temporary solution that is not able to ensure\n242\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2264\nsustainable development of the power system. It can just provide an overview on flexibility of the\nconsumers and their mobility to react to different ToU tariffs. After the optimization function is applied,\nwe obtain the hourly schedule for each appliance for the entire day as in Figure 8.\n \nFigure 7. Daily consumption curve. Payment minimization with intlinprog.\n \nFigure 8. Individual consumption. Payment minimization with inlinprog.\nAlthough the results obtained with intlinprog function are satisfactory, we also applied\nmulti-objective fminimax Matlab function due to the fact that the hourly consumption of all appliances\nform an array of values that should be minimized.\nThe optimization results with fminimax function are presented in Figure 9 (cumulative\nconsumption) and Figure 10 (individual consumption).\nComparing with intlinprog function, although the consumption peak is the same (1.56 kWh),\nthe hourly schedule of the appliances does not comply with their characteristics and consumer\u2019s\npreferences due to the fact that no integer values could be obtained; with fminimax function, imposing\nintegers is not possible.\n243\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2264\nTherefore, the minimization of the consumption peak as objective function and intlinprog as\noptimization function are the most appropriate combination to continue the simulations.\n \nFigure 9. Daily consumption curve. Peak minimization with fminimax.\n \nFigure 10. Individual consumption. Peak minimization with fminimax.\nIn addition to the twelve appliances, we have considered the RES distributed generation (PV) and\na storage device. Thus, on top of the twelve appliances, we have added a PV with a total daily output\nof 2.3 kWh. Hourly minimum/maximum generated energy is around 0.05/0.2 kWh.\nFor simulations, the day-ahead PV forecast is required. Since it is predictable and mainly depends\non solar irradiation, it can be done easily by ARIMA models or even feed-forward neural networks as\nin [26,27].\nIn case we consider the minimization of consumption peak, with PV the following results have\nbeen obtained: Consumption peak 1.56 kWh, electricity payment varies between 2.378 \u20ac (ToU_F) and\n3.295 \u20ac (ToU_A). In Figure 11 the cumulative daily consumption curve and in Figure 12 the individual\nconsumption curves for each appliance plus PV as negative consumption are shown.\n244\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2264\n \nFigure 11. Daily consumption curve with PV. Peak minimization with intlinprog.\n \nFigure 12. Individual consumption with PV. Peak minimization with intlinprog.\nIt can be noticed that the consumption peak remains unchanged, while the electricity payment\nreduces by 11.5% (ToU_A) and 34.1% (ToU_F) as a consequence of the local generation that reduces\nthe consumption from the grid leading to less electricity payment.\nThen, we have added the storage device with high efficiency (90%) that stores the energy generated\nby PV. It operates in charging/discharging alternative cycles considering the objective function of\nthe optimization model. The maximum charging capacity is 0.1 kW, maximum consumed energy is\n1 kWh, while for discharging and the maximum generated energy is 0.9 kWh. In Figure 13 (cumulative\nconsumption) and Figure 14 (individual consumption), the optimization results with PV and SD are\nshown. The daily consumption curve indicates the reduction of the consumption peak, but at some\ntime intervals consumption is fed by PV/ discharging of the SD (especially during 14 and 18 h).\n245\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2264\n \nFigure 13. Daily consumption curve with PV & SD. Peak minimization with intlinprog.\nConsumption of the appliances has been uniformly distributed considering their features,\nconsumer\u2019 preferences and the objective: minimization of the consumption peak as in Figure 14.\n \nFigure 14. Individual consumption with PV & SD. Peak minimization with intlinprog.\nIn this case as a consequence of adding SD, the consumption peak decreases from 1.56 kWh to\n1.34 kWh. Also, the electricity payment varies between 2.164 \u20ac (ToU_F) and 3.304 \u20ac (ToU_A).\nOut of these analyses, the presence of the SD brings benefits from the consumption peak and\nelectricity payment point of view, therefore both grid operators and consumers win when SD is\ninstalled, especially when ToU_F is implemented. In Table 2, the results of the comparative analysis\nwith/without optimization based on the same ToU tariffs A and F, PV and SD scenarios in terms\nof consumption peak and payment are presented. The two ToU tariffs (A and F) give the extreme\nvalues in terms of consumption peak and payment. Tariffs ToU_E and ToU_F offer the best results in\nterms of electricity payment minimization (as in Table 3), especially in the scenario consumption peak\nminimization with PV and SD, applying intlinprog function.\n246\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2264\nTable 2.

This approach is based on the assumption that the residential consumers\u2019 goal is\nto minimize the electricity payment. Therefore, the electricity consumers\u2019 flexibility in terms of shifting\nappliances is rewarded by diminishing the payment using the SD.\nIn Figure 15, the daily consumption curves with inlinprog Matlab function with the two objective\nfunctions (minimization of consumption peak and minimization of electricity payment), then adding\nthe PV and SD to the initial scenario are graphically depicted.\nIn the initial scenario with twelve appliances, we obtain the best results with minimization of\nconsumption peak objective function, then, by adding the PV and SD the results significantly improved.\n247\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2264\n \nPeak minimization  Payment minimization \n \nPeak minimization with PV \n \nPeak minimization with PV & SD \nFigure 15. Daily consumption curves with intlinprog.\n4. Conclusions\nWith smart grids technologies such as smart meters, sensors and actuators, the consumption\noptimization at the residential consumers is nowadays possible. The input data is gathered through a\nset of sensors based on Arduino components for monitoring and controlling the household appliances\nand collecting the data into a relational database running Oracle 12 Database. The optimization process\nconsidering the type of the appliances, reads the initial scheduler and optimizes their consumption\nbased on two objective functions: Minimization of consumption peak and minimization of electricity\npayment. The results lead to the conclusion that only minimization of the consumption peak can\nbring sustainable development of the power systems. In addition, we performed simulations with\ntwo Matlab functions: inlinprog and fminimax; comparing the results, intlinprog function is the most\nappropriate optimization function for reaching our goal.\nThen, on top of the twelve applications, we added PV panels and a storage device in order to\ninvestigate their effect on the consumption curve. In this scenario, the consumption peak reduced by\n47.5% from 2.55 kWh (no optimization) to 1.34 kWh. Also, the daily electricity payment reduces by\n11%. Although the highest electricity payment reduction is reached when the objective function is the\nminimization of the electricity payment (around 50%), the consumption peak in this case increased by\n18%, that leads to non-uniformly loading of the power grid and additional stress that in the end new\npeaks may occur. Therefore, new advanced tariff scheme are needed in order to overcome the new\npeaks. Thus, it is demonstrated that on the long term only the minimization of the consumption peak\nlead to sustainable electricity payment minimization.\n248\nSustainability 2018, 10, 2264\nThe presence of PV and SD is benefic for both grid operators and consumers due to the fact that\nconsumption peak and electricity payment are diminished compared with initial scenario. Although\nthe initial proposed scenarios reduce the consumption peak and electricity payment, presence of PV\nand SD will motivate the consumers to optimize the operation scheduling of their appliances since it\nleads to more savings.\nIn this paper, modeling of different types of appliances is performed, dividing the appliances\nin three categories based on their operation mode. Then, the Arduino based sensors controlling and\nmonitoring of data generated by appliances are depicted, the processing of data being performed\nby several procedures and functions written in PLSQL language included in a proposed informatics\nsolution architecture. Two objective functions: minimization of electricity payment and minimization\nof consumption peak are considered in order to identify the impact of PV and SD in different scenarios\nwith six three-level ToU tariffs. Out of the two objective functions, the minimization of consumption\npeak proved to lead to a sustainable development due to the fact that by flattening the load curve\noverloading of the grids can be avoided. Second approach is to minimize the electricity payment that\nmay lead to new peaks since the consumers will tend to shift their appliances to low rate tariffs. Out of\nsimulations, the ToU tariff pattern that rewards and could motivate best the consumers that are willing\nto change the electricity consumption behavior is identified.\nOne limitation of our approach consists in assuming that the consumers are willing to involve in\noptimization process that is part of a complex demand response program (DR). However, this is not\nalways the case. From different reasons such as (lack of willingness, refrain from revealing private\ninformation or participation denial), some consumers refuse to participate in the DR. In this case the\nDR should be improved, monitored and its performance periodically evaluated.\nAnother limitation consists in difficult implementation since sensors, storage devices and smart\nmeters technologies are not yet implemented at large scale. However, this aspect will be overcome in\nthe near future by the progress of new technologies with gradually decreasing investment cost and\nproper policy regulation.\nAnother limitation is related to the large volume of data flows that require real-time processing\nand big data technologies. The electricity suppliers or grid operators should develop or acquire new IC\n& T solutions that able to process large volume of semi- or unstructured data in order to rapidly react\nto certain circumstances. Nowadays, only few grid operators take advantage of big data technologies,\nbut in short time perspective, the other smaller companies would benefit from cloud solutions that are\nmore affordable and do not require expensive investment in hardware infrastructure.\nThe acquisition of the SD by grid operator can be a solution for their integration as planning and\noperation tool and improvement of the power system operation. This approach would incentive the\nelectricity consumers to use SD. On one hand, the grid operator could benefit from the economy of\nscale by acquiring SD and should easily remotely control the SD with similar characteristics. On the\nother hand, the cost of SD is gradually decreasing. However, the investment decision should be taken\nbased on a detailed feasibility study.\nAuthor Contributions: All authors contributed equally to this work.\nFunding: This research was funded by Executive Unit for Financing Higher Education, Research, Development\nand Innovation (UEFISCDI) grant number PN-III-P2-2.1-PTE-2016-0032, 4PTE/06/10/2016, PNIII\u2014PTE 2016.\nAcknowledgments: This paper presents some results of the research project: Informatics solutions for\noptimizing the operation of photovoltaic power plants (OPTIM-PV), project code: PN-III-P2-2.1-PTE-2016-0032,\n4PTE/06/10/2016, PNIII\u2014PTE 2016.\nConflicts of Interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest.\nReferences\n1.

When optimally designed, HESs prove to be more\nreliable and economical than single energy source systems. This study examines the feasibility of a\ncombined dispatch (CD) control strategy for a photovoltaic (PV)/diesel/battery HES by combining\nthe load following (LF) strategy and cycle charging (CC) strategy. HOMER software is used as a\ntool for optimization analysis by investigating the techno-economic and environmental performance\nof the proposed system under the LF strategy, CC strategy, and combined dispatch CD strategy.\nThe simulation results reveal that the CD strategy has a net present cost (NPC) and cost of energy\n(COE) values of $110,191 and $0.21/kWh, which are 20.6% and 4.8% lower than those of systems\nutilizing the LF and CC strategies, respectively. From an environmental point of view, the CD\nstrategy also offers the best performance, with CO2 emissions of 27,678 kg/year. Moreover, the results\nshow that variations in critical parameters, such as battery minimum state of charge, time step,\nsolar radiation, diesel price, and load growth, exert considerable effects on the performance of the\nproposed system.\nKeywords: combined dispatch (CD) strategy; optimization; HOMER; net present cost (NPC);\nsensitivity analysis\n1. Introduction\nProgressive energy demand growth and rapid depletion of fossil fuels have raised concerns\nof future energy supplies [1]. Moreover, the utilization of conventional energy sources from fossil\nfuels has resulted in tremendous increases in CO2 emissions, which are the primary cause of global\nwarming [2,3]. The atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased by approximately 40% compared\nwith that at the beginning of the industrial revolution [4]. These issues have led to the determination\nof alternative energy sources with the potential to reduce pollution and produce a sustainable energy\nsupply [5]. The utilization of renewable energy sources (RESs) has grown exponentially over the last\nfew years. By the end of 2017, approximately 26.5% of the total global electricity produced came\nfrom RES, as shown in Figure 1 [6]. RESs, such as solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, and biomass,\nare easily replenished and environmentally friendly. However, the major drawback of RESs is the\nunpredictable and intermittent nature of power generation. This issue can be overcome by integrating\nSustainability 2019, 11, 683; doi:10.3390/su11030683 www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability252\nSustainability 2019, 11, 683\ndifferent energy sources to produce a hybrid energy system (HES), which can solve reliability problems\nand provide an environmentally friendly solution [7\u20139]. Various power sources and storages, such as\ndiesel generators, batteries, and supercapacitors, should be integrated into HESs to improve system\nstability and smooth out fluctuations [10,11].\nFigure 1. Energy mix of the global electricity generation by the end of 2017 [6].\nThe optimal design of HESs requires appropriate sizing of the components and a feasible energy\nmanagement strategy. Selection of a suitable energy management strategy is critical because it\ndetermines the behavior of the system by controlling the flow of energy and deciding the priority\nof each component in the system [12]. The proper energy management strategy is therefore able\nto improve the power system stability, ensure the continuity of power supply, minimize the cost of\nenergy (COE), and protect components against damage due to overloads. Moreover, in grid-connected\nsystems, the energy management strategy is vital to control the flow of energy from and to the grid\nand for metering purposes [13,14]. Depending on the system configuration and the optimization\nobjectives, different energy management strategies are performed based on various technical and\neconomic criterions. These strategies can be less or more complicated, requiring the utilization of less\nor more complicated optimization algorithms [15].\nThe energy management strategy is conducted by selecting, installing, and programming a central\ncontroller to manage the flow of energy according to an optimized strategy. Various mathematical\nprograms and optimization techniques are employed to design and plan energy management strategies.\nThese strategies include off-grid and grid-connected HESs as presented in Figure 2 [14].\n \nFigure 2. Commonly used approaches for energy management strategies [14].\n253\nSustainability 2019, 11, 683\nAlthough the non-dispatchable RESs necessitate complex systems modeling, they are themselves\nsimple to model without the need for control logic, in which the power is merely produced in direct\nresponse to the available renewable energy resources. On the other hand, the dispatchable components,\nsuch as the generator and battery, are more difficult to model because they must be controlled\nto achieve matching of demand and supply properly, and to compensate for the intermittency of\nthe non-dispatchable RESs [16,17]. \u201cShould a generator charge the battery or should excess solar\nproduction be responsible for charging the battery only and the generator used only to satisfy the\nload?\u201d This question has led to some rules that manage the operation of generator and battery energy\nstorage. The load following (LF) and cycle charging (CC) dispatch strategies are used to control\ngenerator operation and battery energy storage. Under the LF strategy, a generator produces only\nenough power to satisfy the load demand and does not charge the batteries. Batteries are charged\nonly by excess electricity from RESs. Under the CC strategy, the generator operates at its maximum\nrated capacity whenever it is switched on to feed the load and charge the battery bank by the excess\npower [18,19]. In the CC strategy, a setpoint state-of-charge (SOC) can be applied. When a certain\nsetpoint is selected, the system does not stop charging the battery until it reaches the specified\nsetpoint [20\u201322]. The chosen dispatch strategies are applied only when dispatchable components such\nas generator and battery are operating simultaneously during a time step [23].\nHOMER software that was developed by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL),\nUnited States, is considered one of the most powerful tools for the optimization of HESs through\nperforming a techno-economic analysis of the system with a project lifetime of a certain number of\nyears [24]. Different technologies, such as PV, wind turbine, hydrokinetic, hydropower, biomass,\nconventional generator, battery, flywheel, supercapacitor, and fuel cell, can be addressed with HOMER.\nHOMER can model both the LF strategy and CC strategy to control the generator and energy storage\noperation. Both of these strategies make economic dispatch decisions; they choose the most economical\nway to serve the load at each time step. HOMER simulates hundreds or even thousands of all possible\ncombinations of the energy system and then ranks the results according to the least-cost options that\nmeet the load requirements [25\u201327].\nMany studies throughout the world have used HOMER software to investigate the optimal design\nof proposed HESs using LF or CC strategies. Halabi et al. [28], Ansong et al. [29], Sigarchian et al. [30],\nRezzouk and Mellit [31], and Madziga et al. [32] used the LF strategy to analyze the performance\nof suggested HESs to find the optimal configurations. Each study proposed certain components\nthat differed from others and the simulation was conducted for a specific area. On the other hand,\nthe authors in [9,33\u201337] carried out techno-economic analysis to investigate the optimum HES using\nthe CC strategy in which different setpoints SOC were suggested.\nOther studies have been conducted to investigate the optimum HES using both the LF strategy\nand the CC strategy to find the best one for the proposed HESs. Kansara and Parekh [38] performed\ndispatch analysis of a stand-alone wind/diesel/battery energy system and found that the system\nachieved better performance for high renewable penetration under the LF strategy; for low renewable\npenetration, the CC strategy was preferable. The optimal size of the PV/diesel/battery power system\nunder the LF and CC control strategies was investigated in [39], and results showed that the optimum\ndesign for the CC strategy had a smaller COE than that of the LF strategy. The authors in [40] presented\na techno-economic analysis of the PV/diesel/battery system and concluded that the LF provided\nbetter economic performance compared to the CC strategy. A comparison of the LF and CC control\nstrategies for two different HESs was studied in [41], and it was found that for the PV/diesel HES,\nthe CC strategy provided better performance in terms of net present cost (NPC), COE, and greenhouse\ngas (GHG) emissions, but not in terms of renewable penetration. For a wind/diesel system, the LF\ndispatch strategy demonstrated better techno-economic and environmental performance than the\nCC strategy. The authors in [42] investigated the best energy management strategy for HESs in\nthree different places in India and found that the LF strategy achieved better techno-economic and\nenvironmental performance than the CC strategy for all locations. The optimum planning and design\n254\nSustainability 2019, 11, 683\nof the PV/diesel/battery for a school, a small dispensary, and 25 households using both LF and CC\ncontrol strategies was examined by Fodhil et al. [43], who showed that the LF strategy was more cost\neffective for the dispensary, while the CC strategy was more cost effective for both the school and\nhouseholds. Moreover, the LF strategy had more PV penetration and less GHG emissions than the CC\nstrategy in all cases. Shoeb and Shafiullah [44] investigated the performance of a PV/diesel/battery\nHES for standalone electrification of a rural area in southern Bangladesh. They showed that the CC\nstrategy was more economical than the LF strategy. Ghenai and Bettayeb [45] analyzed the feasibility\nof different off-grid HESs using PV, diesel, battery, and fuel cell to supply electricity for a building\nin the University of Sharjah, UAE. They reported that for all cases, the use of the CC strategy for\npower generation was preferable to the LF strategy. Maatallah et al. [46] studied the techno-economic\nfeasibility of a PV/wind/diesel/battery hybrid system for a case study in Bizerte, Tunisia and found\nthat the LF strategy was more cost-effective than the CC strategy. The system under the LF strategy\nwas able to save more than $27,000 during the project lifetime. A study on the viability of supplying\nelectricity through an HES consisting of a PV, diesel generator, biomass plant, and batteries to rural\nareas in the northern region of Bangladesh was presented in [47]. It was found that the CC strategy\nwas more economical than the LF strategy and it was capable of saving around $12,450 during the\nproject lifetime. On the other hand, the LF strategy caused the cost of energy (COE) to increase from\n$0.188/kWh to $0.189/kWh.\nFrom the previous works, it has been found that the optimum dispatch strategy is affected by\nvarious parameters, such as fuel price, fuel conversion efficiency of the generator, operation and\nmaintenance (O&M) costs, renewable penetration, and battery and generator capacity. Moreover,\nLF and CC strategies are found to be simple and effective tools for the control of HESs, but they have\nsome drawbacks. By using a generator to charge batteries during operation, the CC dispatch strategy\nprovides more energy to the batteries. This approach shuts down the generator during the low-load\nperiod, which results in a reduction of the total operating time of the generator. However, the sequence\nof the battery charging/discharging process may damage or ruin the battery, which leads to increased\nreplacement costs. On the other hand, when the generator satisfies the load demand without charging\nthe batteries, the LF dispatch strategy ensures that the batteries remain charged by the RES output\npower only, and this maximizes the use of available renewable energy. Furthermore, in the LF strategy,\nthe utilization of the battery is limited. Hence, a longer life of the battery can be achieved. However,\nthe main drawback of the LF strategy is that for most of the time, the generator works at part load,\nand this increases the variable cost due to the lower off-design efficiency. In many cases, the system\nperformance under one of these dispatch strategies is much better than that of the other. However,\npredicting the best strategy before running the model is difficult.\nBased on the literature review and the research gap discussed above, the objective of this paper is\nto examine the techno-economic and environmental performance of an off-grid PV/diesel/battery\nHES supplying electricity to a small remote village in Iraq using a combined dispatch (CD) strategy.\nCombining the LF and CC dispatch strategies may help improve the system performance by allowing\nmore efficient utilization of the generator and batteries. The system performance under this strategy\nis compared with the existing dispatch strategies (LF and CC), and HOMER software is utilized\nfor analysis of the proposed systems. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first study\ninvestigating the techno-economic and environmental performance of an HES using the CD strategy.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the methodology, which\nprovides the assessment of site specifications, load profile, metrological data, system components,\nmathematical representation, and the control strategy. Section 3 presents the results obtained, including\nthe optimization and sensitivity analysis. Finally, the conclusion is given in Section 4.\n255\nSustainability 2019, 11, 683\n2. Methodology\nSuccessful evaluation of any renewable energy project requires appropriate criteria to be applied\nin the selected area to ensure that the operational behavior of different scenarios can be analyzed\naccurately. The following analysis frameworks are adopted in the current work:\n\u2022 Selected site specifications and load demand data\n\u2022 Metrological data (solar radiation and temperature)\n\u2022 Hybrid power system components\n\u2022 Mathematical representation\n\u2022 System operational control\n2.1. Specification and Load Profile of the Selected Site\nThe remote rural village selected as a case study in this research is located at Muqdadiyah\nDistrict, Diyala, Iraq. The village consists of 40 households with total number of people of around 150.\nWater-wells and hand pumps are the primary sources of water in the area. The village does not have\naccess to grid power, and this situation may open new opportunities for utilization of stand-alone\nHESs to provide electricity for the area. Similar to most remote rural areas, the residential units of the\nvillage require a low electricity supply for electrical appliances and lighting. Figure 3 shows the total\ndaily load profile of the village\u2019s households [48]. A 5% random variability is considered for time step\nto time step and day-to-day analyses to provide better reliability. During the first hours of the day\n(00:00\u201306:00), the power consumption is low since the people are asleep. From 06:00\u201307:00, the load\nprofile shows an increase since most of the people get ready either to leave for schools or their work.\nThen the load profile decreases again, as most of the family members are outside, and continue until\n14:00 when people come back to their homes. Starting from 14:00 the load profile shows a continues\nincrement and the maximum is recorded from 19:00\u201321:00 since most people are present in their\nhomes; then, the load decreases, which refers to the start of sleep time. A daily total energy demand of\n145 kWh/day, a daily average of 6.04 kW, and power peak load of 18.29 kW are found.\n \nFigure 3. The total daily load profile of the village\u2019s households [49].\n2.2. Solar Resource and Temperature\nSolar radiation and ambient temperature are the two parameters with the most profound effects on\nthe output PV power. In this framework, HOMER software uses the monthly average global horizontal\nradiation and ambient temperature as input parameters. Section 2.4 provides the mathematical\nexpression of the effects of these parameters on the output PV power. The following points explain\nthe solar radiation and ambient temperature data in the selected site, which were obtained from the\nNASA website [49].\n\u2022 The solar radiation and clearance index data for the selected village (33\u25e6 N latitude and 44\u25e6 E\nlongitude) are presented in Figure 4. The annual average solar radiation is 5.02 kWh/m2/day,\n256\nSustainability 2019, 11, 683\nmaximum solar radiation (7.56 kWh/m2/day) is recorded in June, and the minimum solar\nradiation (2.62 kWh/m2/day) is recorded in December. The amount of solar radiation received\nby the area is relatively high, which indicates that the solar energy system is an attractive\npower source.\n\u2022 The ambient temperature plays a vital role in the performance of PV modules. Therefore, accurate\nmeasurement of ambient temperature data is essential. The monthly average ambient temperature\nfor the chosen area is illustrated in Figure 5. The summer season shows the highest ambient\ntemperature, at 36.15 \u25e6C in July, and the winter season records the lowest ambient temperature,\nat 9.77 \u25e6C in January. In HOMER software, the ambient temperature is taken into consideration\nwhen calculating the output PV power.\n \nFigure 4. Monthly average solar global radiation and clearance index of the village.\n \nFigure 5. Monthly average temperature of the village.\n2.3. System Components\nIn this research, the proposed HES consists of four components, i.e., the PV system, diesel\ngenerator, converter, and batteries. A schematic diagram of the proposed HES is illustrated in Figure 6.\nThe techno-economic input parameters for all components in the HES are explained in detail in\nTable 1. Note that the technical parameters and costs of the components were obtained from several\nreferences [28,50\u201352]. Regarding the capacity, the optimizer lets HOMER find the optimal sizes for\nsystem components.\n257\nSustainability 2019, 11, 683\nFigure 6.

Mathematical Representation\n2.4.1. Output PV Power\nThe output PV power is known to be profoundly affected by the amount of the solar radiation\navailable and the temperature. In this respect, the following expression is used in HOMER to compute\nthe output PV power [53,54]:\nPPV = YPV fPV\n(\nGT\nGT,STC\n)[\n1 + \u03b1p(Tc \u2212 Tc,STC)\n]\n(1)\n258\nSustainability 2019, 11, 683\nwhere YPV is the PV rated capacity under standard test conditions (kW), fPV is the derating factor of\nPV, GT is the solar radiation incident on the PV array in the current time step (kW/m2), GT,STC is the\nincident irradiance at standard test conditions (1 kW/m2), \u03b1p is the temperature coefficient of power\n(%/\u25e6C), TC is the temperature of the PV cell (\u25e6C) in the current time step, and TC,STC is the temperature\nof the PV cell under standard test conditions (25 \u25e6C).\nThe PV cell temperature is calculated using the following expression:\nTc =\nTa + (Tc,NOCT \u2212 Ta,NOCT)\n(\nGT\nGT,NOCT\n)[\n1 \u2212 \u03b7mp,STC(1\u2212\u03b1pTc,STC)\u03c4\u03b1\n]\n1 + (Tc,NOCT \u2212 Ta,NOCT)( GTGT,NOCT )(\n\u03b1p\u03b7mp,STC\n\u03c4\u03b1 )\n(2)\nwhere Ta is the ambient temperature (\u25e6C), TC,NOCT is the nominal operating cell temperature (NOCT)\nin (\u25e6C), Ta,NOCT is the ambient temperature at which the NOCT is defined (20 \u25e6C), GT,NOCT is the solar\nradiation at which the NOCT is defined (0.8 kW/m2), \u03b7mp,STC is the maximum power point efficiency\nunder standard test conditions (%), \u03c4 is the solar transmittance of any cover over the PV array (%),\nand \u03b1 is the solar absorptance of the PV array (%).\n2.4.2. Economic Model\nConsidering that the purpose of HOMER is to reduce the costs of system operation and determine\nthe optimum system configuration, economics play a crucial role in this simulation. The optimum\ncombination of the HES components is obtained on the basis of the NPC, which is the sum of all costs\nand revenues that take place throughout the lifetime of a project. To calculate the total NPC of a system,\nthe following equation is used [55,56]:\nNPC =\nCann,tot\nCRF(i, Tp)\n(3)\nwhere Cann,tot is the total annualized cost ($/year), i is the annual real interest rate (%), TP is the project\nlifetime (year), and CRF is the capital recovery factor, which is given by [55,56]:\nCRF(i, n) =\ni (1 + i)n\n(1 + i)n \u2212 1 (4)\nwhere n is the number of years.\nSalvage costs (SC), which are the residual values of the system components by the end of the\nproject lifetime, are taken into consideration in the NPC calculation. The following expression is\nutilized to find the SC [54]:\nSC = CRC\nTrem\nTcom\n(5)\nwhere CRC is the cost of replacement ($), Trem represents the remaining life of the component (year),\nand Tcom refers to the component lifetime (year).\nCOE is the average cost per kWh of producing electricity, given by [53,56]:\nCOE =\nCann,tot\nEann,tot\n(6)\nwhere Eann,tot is the total electrical load served (kWh/year).\n2.5. Control Strategy\nThe two control methods of the hybrid PV/diesel/battery system are the LF and CC dispatch\nstrategies. In this study, these two strategies are presented for PV/diesel/battery HES and compared\nwith the proposed combined strategy. The implementation of these strategies in practice can be done\nusing a suitable controller, such as microcontroller, PLC, FPGA, etc.\n259\nSustainability 2019, 11, 683\n2.5.1. Load Following Strategy\nFigure 7 shows the flowchart of the LF dispatch strategy for the PV/diesel/battery HES.\nThe system operation of this model can be classified into three cases as follows:\n\u0003 The first case is when the output PV power is equal to the load power. Here, the PV power meets\nthe load demand, the batteries do not draw any energy, and the generator stays off. In this case,\nno excess power exists.\n\u0003 The second case takes place when the output PV power is higher than the load power. The PV\nfeeds the load resulting in excess power. In this case, the excess power will be damped if the\nbattery is fully charged. In the case where the battery is not fully charged, the excess PV power is\nused to charge the battery. The generator also does not work in this case.\n\u0003 The last case is when the PV power is lower than the load power. The two possible subcases are\nas follows:\n\u2022 If SOC = SOCmin, the generator works to feed the net load (load minus renewable power).\nThe generator provides only enough power to satisfy the net load without charging the\nbattery. It is important to mention that if the minimum generator loading output power is\nhigher than the net load, the generator works to feed the load and the excess power from the\nPV charges the battery.\n\u2022 If SOC > SOCmin, a cost of discharging the battery is computed and compared with the\ncost of turning on the generator that operates only to serve the net load. If the battery\ndischarging cost is higher than the cost of turning on a generator, then the battery would\nnot be discharged while the generator runs and produce enough power to meet the load\ndemand without charging the battery. Otherwise, the battery is discharged. The following\nequations explain the cost of each decision:\n\u2022 The cost of discharging the batteries is calculated using the following equation [16,57]:\nCdisch = Cbatt,wear. (7)\nCbatt,wear is the battery wear cost ($/kWh), which is given by [16,57]:\nCbatt,wear =\nCbatt,rep\nNbattQli f e\n\u221a\n\u03b7rt\n(8)\nwhere Cbatt,rep is the battery replacement cost ($), Nbatt is the number of batteries in the\nstorage bank, Qlife is the single battery throughput (kWh), and \u03b7rt is the battery round trip\nefficiency (%).\nThe cost of turning on the generator ($/kWh), in which the generator operates only to serve the\nnet load, is calculated using the following expression [58]:\nCgen =\nFconFprice\nLservedGoutput\n+\nCgen,rep\nLservedGli f etime\n+\nCgen,O&M\nLserved\n(9)\nwhere Fcon is the fuel consumption (L/hour), Fprice is the fuel price ($/L), Lserved is the total load to be\nserved, Goutput is the generator output (kW), Cgen,rep is the replacement cost of the generator ($/kWh),\nGlifetime is the generator lifetime, and Cgen,O&M is the O&M cost of the generator.\n260\nSustainability 2019, 11, 683\nFigure 7. Load following (LF) dispatch strategy for the PV/diesel/battery HES.\n2.5.2. Cycle Charging Strategy\nThe flowchart of the CC dispatch strategy for the PV/diesel/battery HES is shown in Figure 8.\nThe operating strategy of this system is identical to that of the system utilizing LF dispatch. However,\nthe strategy differs from the LF strategy in that when the generator is switched on, it runs at\nits maximum rated capacity to supply the net load and charge the battery with excess energy.\nThe following equations explain the cost of each decision:\nThe cost of discharging the batteries is calculated using [16,57]:\nCdisch = Cbatt,wear + Cbatt,energy (10)\nBattery energy cost, Cbatt,energy ($/kWh) is calculated in time step n using the following\nexpression [57,58]:\nCbatt,energy,n =\nn\u22121\n\u2211\ni=1\nCcc,i\nn\u22121\n\u2211\ni=1\nEcc,i\n(11)\n261\nSustainability 2019, 11, 683\nwhere Ccc,i is the cost of cycle charging in time step i ($), and Ecc,i is the quantity of energy put into the\nbatteries in time step i (kWh).\nThe cost of running the generator at maximum capacity to meet the net load and charge the\nbattery is calculated using the following equation [58]:\nCgen,ch = Cgen + Ccc \u2212 Cbatt,energy (12)\nwhere Ccc here refers to the cost of cycle charge in the current time step, which is calculated using [58]:\nCcc = Cgen,marg + Cbatt,wear. (13)\nCgen,marg is the marginal cost of the generator ($/kWh), which is calculated using the following\nexpression [58]:\nCgen,marg =\nFslopeFprice\n\u03b7rt\n(14)\nwhere Fslope is the slope of fuel curve (L/kWh).\nFigure 8. Cycle charging (CC) dispatch strategy for PV/diesel/battery HES.\n262\nSustainability 2019, 11, 683\n2.5.3. Combined Dispatch Strategy\nThe decision of charging the battery by the diesel generator depends mainly on the future net\nload, which is the difference between the load demand and the output power from renewable sources.\nAs predicting the future net load is challenging, the current net load is used in the CD strategy\nas a proxy for the future net load to investigate whether to charge the battery from the generator.\nThis strategy tends to use the LF strategy when the net load is high and the CC strategy when the net\nload is low. During a low net load period, the CC strategy avoids the use of the generator. On the\nother hand, the LF strategy ensures continuous usage of the generator during high net load periods.\nThe flexibility of the CD strategy based on high and low loads makes this model capable of producing\nbetter performance in the energy access scenarios compared with individual LF or CC strategies.\nFigure 9 shows the flowchart of the PV/diesel/battery HES with the CD strategy. As shown in the\nfigure, three dispatch decisions are available in this strategy. At every time step, the CD strategy\ncalculates the cost of each possible decision to obtain the least costly choice. This cost includes expenses\nin the current time step and the expected value of any change in the battery-stored energy, and a\ndecision is made according to the tradeoff between the marginal cost of operating the generator and\nthe battery wear cost. The details of the three cases are as follows:\n\u0003 The first decision takes place when the generator provides only enough electricity to satisfy the\nnet load without charging the battery.\n\u0003 In the second decision, the generator meets the net load and charges the battery with the\nexcess power.\n\u0003 The third decision is feeding the net load by the battery alone.\nThe system operation of this model can be explained as follows:\n\u0003 If the PV power is equal to or higher than the load demand, the power flow is the same for that\nof LF and CC strategies.\n\u0003 If the PV power is less than the load power, the two possible subcases are as follows:\n\u2022 If SOC = SOCmin, the controller compares the cost of running the generator to produce only\nenough power to feed the net load without charging the battery with the cost of running\nthe generator at its maximum capacity to serve the net load and charge the battery with the\nexcess electricity. A decision is made based on the least cost dispatch decision.\n\u2022 If SOC > SOCmin, three decision costs are compared with each other, which are: the cost\nof turning on the generator that operates only to serve the net load without charging the\nbattery, the cost of running the generator at its maximum capacity to serve the net load and\ncharge the battery, and the cost of discharging the battery. The power flow solution is taken\nplace according to the minimum cost decision.\n3. Results and Discussion\nThe simulation results are presented and analyzed in this section. The HES was simulated under\nthe three different dispatch strategies. First, the technical feasibility was examined to investigate the\nability of the available energy to satisfy electric load demand throughout the year. Then, the economic\nviability and environmental effects of the proposed systems were investigated. Finally, a sensitivity\nanalysis was performed to determine the impact of some critical parameters on the system performance.\nThe simulation was performed using an annual discount rate of 7.8% and a 20-year project lifetime.\nMoreover, the system performance was set at a maximum capacity shortage of 1% and a battery\nminimum SOC of 25%.\n263\nSustainability 2019, 11, 683\nFigure 9. Combined dispatch (CD) strategy for PV/diesel/battery HES.\n3.1. Optimization Results\nA feasible system is one that can meet the load demands. In HOMER, the infeasible systems\nwere excluded, while the feasible ones were filtered and presented by their NPC. A comparison of\nthe optimized PV/diesel/battery systems under different dispatch strategies is provided in Table 2.\nThe results show that best optimal combination of PV/diesel/battery HES under the CD strategy\nconsisted of a 19.4 kW PV, a diesel generator with a 21 kW capacity, 220 batteries, and an 8.05 kW\npower converter. The system yielded an NPC of $110,191 and COE of $0.21/kWh, which were 20.6%\nand 4.8% lower than those of systems utilizing the LF and CC strategies, respectively. These results\ncan be interpreted by the fact that the CD strategy obtained the most economical cost dispatch decision\nbetween LF and CC at every time step.\nIn the LF dispatch strategy, better renewable source utilization could be attained because the\ndiesel generator contributed approximately 40.6% of the total energy production, the lowest compared\nwith that in other strategies. This condition led to greater dependency on renewable components,\nwhich was in contrast to the CC dispatch strategy, wherein the generator produced a 73.8% share\nof the total energy production. The renewable fractions of LF, CC, and CD strategies were 44.7%,\n18.4%, and 35.6%, respectively. The monthly average electric production for the system under the three\ndispatch strategies for one year is presented in Figure 10.\nIn terms of diesel generator performance, the diesel generator under the CD strategy yielded\n2171 working hours; these values were lower than those of the LF and CC strategies, and, hence,\n264\nSustainability 2019, 11, 683\nthe higher generator operation life was obtained under this strategy. The results show that the\noperating lifespans of LF, CC, and CD strategies were 4.08 years, 4.58 years, and 6.91 years, respectively.\nMoreover, it was found that the generator under the CD strategy consumed the lowest amount of\ndiesel with 10,574 L/year, which was 1.7% and 23% lower than the system under the LF and CC\nstrategies, respectively. Figure 11 shows the fuel consumption duration curve for the system under\nthe three dispatch strategies for the entire year. It is evident that despite the fact that the generator\nworking hours of the LF strategy were more than those of the CC strategy, the fuel consumption of the\nLF strategy was lower than that of the CC strategy. This is because the generator under the LF strategy\nproduced only enough power to feed the load, in contrast to the CC strategy, in which the generator\noperated at its maximum rated capacity to supply the load and charge the battery; hence, more diesel\nwould be consumed.\nBattery energy storage is a critical component of standalone HESs because this parameter affects\nthe reliability of meeting loads. Battery throughput (kWh/year) is a performance measure defined\nas the amount of energy that cycles through the storage bank in one year. Battery throughput affects\nthe battery operational lifetime; the lower the annual battery throughput (lower charge/discharge\ncycles per year), the higher the battery lifetime [59]. Figure 12 shows the battery input/output energies\nunder the three different strategies. Since the use of the battery in the LF strategy was limited, the LF\nstrategy presented the lowest amount of input/output energy, followed by the CD strategy and the CC\nstrategy, which showed the highest amount of input/output energy. These results show the LF strategy\npresented the lowest annual battery throughput, which was estimated to be 54.15 kWh, in contrast\nto the CC strategy, which had a yearly throughput of 79.9 kWh. The annual throughput of CD was\ncalculated to be 70.76 kWh.\nBattery autonomy refers to the number of hours a battery can support the critical load without\ncharging during the main failure. Achieving some battery autonomy is necessary, especially during\nthe rainy season when the output PV power cannot meet the load demand [60]. The simulation results\nindicate that the battery autonomy of the LF strategy was 8.94 h, which was the highest among those\nof other strategies. This result is due to the high nominal capacity of the system under this strategy.\nThe battery autonomy values of the CC and CD strategies were 4.17 and 6.55 h, respectively.\nTable 2.

Economic Analysis of the System under the Three Dispatch Strategies\nA cost summary of the system under all dispatch strategies is shown in Figure 13. The following\nbullets describe the cost analysis for each configuration:\n\u2022 The lowest capital cost was achieved by using the CC strategy ($32,537), followed by the CD\nstrategy ($50,042). The system under CC had a capital cost of $64,779, which was the highest\namong the systems compared, because of the large sizes of renewable components.\n\u2022 Once installed, the PV, converter, and batteries under all strategies were inexpensive to operate\nand maintain compared with the diesel generator, which contributed most of the total O&M cost.\nThe CD strategy was found to have the lowest O&M cost, which was $18,172, i.e., 37.7% and\n21.9% lower than those of LF and CC, respectively.\n\u2022 The replacement cost of the LF, CC, and CD strategies were $9005, $8457, and $5135, respectively.\nThe CD strategy had the lowest cost because it depended less on the diesel generator, which led\nto making this strategy have the highest generator lifetime as compared to other strategies.\n\u2022 The fuel cost of the CD strategy was $42,016, which was lower than that of the other strategies,\nbecause of the relatively low fuel consumption in this strategy. The fuel costs of the LF and CC\nstrategies were $42,742 and $55,182, respectively.\n\u2022 The salvage costs over the project lifetime of the LF, CC, and CD strategies were estimated to be\n$\u20136974, $\u20133727, and $\u20135174, respectively; these costs originated from the remaining life of the\nsystem components.\n267\nSustainability 2019, 11, 683\n \nFigure 13. Cost summary of PV/diesel/battery under different dispatch strategies. O&M is operation\nand maintenance.\n3.3. Environmental Assessment\nConsumption of diesel has a negative impact on the environment and is harmful to human\nhealth, since different kinds of gaseous pollutants are emitted during the process. These emissions\ninclude nitrogen oxide (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (PM), unburned hydrocarbon\n(UHC), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2) [61]. The HESs have positive effects on\nthe environment. Combining PV with the diesel and battery is capable of reducing the emissions\nsignificantly [31]. The releasing of annual emissions for the HES under different control strategies has\nbeen determined and demonstrated to compare the cases from the environmental standpoint. Table 3\npresents the greenhouse emissions of PV/diesel/battery with LF, CC, and CD strategies. It is obvious\nthat the system with CD was the most environmentally friendly option by having the lowest amount\nof CO2 emissions (27,678 kg/year), in contrast to the system with the CC strategy, which had CO2\nemissions of 36,352 kg/year. The CO2 emissions of the system with the LF strategy were calculated to\nbe 28,157 kg/year. These results were achieved according to the resulting fuel consumption presented\nin Table 2, which indicates that the diesel generator under the CD strategy yielded a fuel consumption\nof 10,574 L/year, lower than that of the LF and CC strategies. As a result, minimum greenhouse\nemissions were obtained under this strategy.\nTable 3. Pollutant emissions for different control strategies.

Energy Balance of the Optimized Systems\nIn order to have a better understanding of the system operation, details of the system\u2019s power\nflow and the battery status during 24 h in April for LF, CC, and CD strategies are provided in this\nsection. The energy flow and the battery status for each strategy are explained in the following points:\n\u2022 LF strategy: Figure 14 shows the energy balance and battery SOC of the proposed HES under\nLF strategy. At the start of the day (00:00\u201305:30), the battery discharged its power to supply\nthe load alone. At 05:30, the PV array began producing power, but it was not enough to meet\nthe load; therefore, the batteries continued to discharge their power for half an hour. At 06:00,\nthe batteries reached their minimum SOC, so the generator worked to meet the load while the\nbatteries were charged by the excess power from PV until 07:00. For the period between 07:00\nand 13:30, PV power was sufficient to fulfill all demand and charge the battery. From 13:30 to\n16:30 the generator restarted and worked together with the PV. From 16:30 to 18:30, the batteries\ndischarged to help the PV and the generator in satisfying the load. At 18:30, the PV power became\nzero, and the load was met by the generator and the batteries for the rest of the day.\n\u2022 CC strategy: The energy balance and battery SOC of the proposed HES under CC strategy is\ndepicted in Figure 15. For the first few hours (00:00\u201305:30), the load was served by the battery,\nsimilar to the LF strategy. From 05:30 to 07:00, both the PV and battery shared to satisfy the load.\nFrom 07:00 to 10:00, the generator produced power so that both the PV and generator could serve\nthe load. Since it was a cycle-charging scheme, the excess power of the generator was used to\ncharge the battery. The load was satisfied by the PV, which also charged the batteries from 10:00\nto 12:30. At 12:30, the PV output showed a decrease in its output power; therefore, the batteries\ndischarged their power to compensate for the required power and continued to do so until 15:30.\nAt 15:30, the generator worked with the PV to feed the load and charge the batteries. The PV\noutput fell to zero at 18:30 and the generator continued to feed the load for the remaining time of\nthe day.\n\u2022 CD strategy: Figure 16 presents the energy balance and battery SOC of the proposed HES under\nCD strategy. As in the LF and CC strategies, the load was served by the battery alone from 00:00\nuntil 05:30. From 05:30 until 15:30, the PV supplied the load and charged the battery during\nthe high solar radiation hours, while the batteries discharged their power to share with the\nPV in satisfying the load during the low solar radiation hours. Around 15:30, the generator\noperated at its maximum rated capacity to share in meeting the load with the PV and charged\nthe batteries by the excess power. This case represented the CC strategy, which continued until\n18:30. After 18:30, the PV output became zero, and the generator produced only enough power to\nsatisfy the load without charging the battery. This case referred to the LF strategy and continued\nuntil 19:30. The CC strategy took place again from 19:30 to 21:30. In the period from 21:30 to 22:00,\nthe generator and the batteries shared to feed the load. At 22:00, the generator turned off, and the\nload was served by the batteries for the remaining time.\n269\nSustainability 2019, 11, 683\n \n \nFigure 14.

Sensitivity Analysis\nIn this part of the study, sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of important\nparameters on the system performance. The parameters considered for sensitivity analysis were battery\nminimum SOC, time step, solar radiation, diesel price, and load growth.\n3.5.1. Battery Minimum SOC\nBattery SOCmin is the lowest acceptable battery charge level. The battery level is never drawn\nbelow the SOCmin, which is given as a percentage of the total capacity. In this part, the impact of the\nSOCmin on the system performance was investigated. The variations in SOCmin were set to 15%, 20%,\n25%, 30%, 35%, and 40. Figure 17 shows a graph of the total NPC and CO2 emissions cost as a function\nof SOCmin variation. As can be seen in the Figure, when the SOCmin increased from 15% to 40%, CO2\nemissions increased from 25,468 kg/year to 34,159 kg/year. This result indicated that an increase in\nSOCmin would increase the system\u2019s dependence on the diesel generator to supply the load demand\nand charge the battery, resulting in greater CO2 emissions. Moreover, NPC increased from $107,637 to\n$114,274. However, researchers have recommended that the SOCmin not be set to an extremely low\nvalue to avoid damaging the storage bank by excessive discharge [62\u201365].\n3.5.2. Time Step\nThe system operation was simulated by performing energy balance calculations in every time step\nfor 8760 h in a year. A comparison between the output power of the available energy sources and load\ndemand was conducted at every time step, and the flow of energy from and to every component in the\nsystem was investigated. For a system that included a generator and a battery, a decision was made\nat each time step on the operation of the generator and whether to charge or discharge the battery.\nSensitivity analysis was performed in this section to evaluate the effect of time step variations from\n5 min to 1 h on the system performance. As shown in Figure 18, the best economic performance was\nachieved by setting the time step to 5 min, which gave an NPC of $109,982. This can be explained\nby the fact that reducing the time step led to an increase in the number of times of cost comparison,\nwhich led to a minimum possible cost. At the same time, the most environmentally friendly system\n271\nSustainability 2019, 11, 683\ncould also be obtained when the time step was set to 5 min; in such a case, the CO2 emissions were\n26,257 kg/year.\n \nFigure 17. Impact of battery minimum SOC on CO2 emissions and NPC.\n \nFigure 18. Impact of time step on CO2 emissions and NPC.\n3.5.3. Solar Radiation\nGlobal solar radiation intensity and the efficiency of the solar panels play a significant role in\nthe harvesting of solar energy in the HESs. The power produced by the PV panels increases when\nthe solar radiation increases and vice-versa; hence, the variation of solar radiation can significantly\naffect the performance of the system. In this subsection, the annual average global solar radiation\nwas varied between 4 kWh/m2/day and 6 kWh/m2/day. Figure 19 shows the graph of NPC and\nCO2, with the variation of solar radiation. The NPC and CO2 of the system decreased from $113,792 to\n$107,627 and from $35,038/kWh to $26,874/kWh, respectively, when solar radiation increased from\n4 kWh/m2/day to 6 kWh/m2/day. The decrements of NPC and CO2 occurred because the increase\n272\nSustainability 2019, 11, 683\nof solar radiation increased the output power of PV; hence, the generator operation hours and fuel\nconsumption were reduced.\n \nFigure 19. Impact of solar radiation on CO2 emissions and NPC.\n3.5.4. Diesel Fuel Price\nIt is well known that the fuel price fluctuates continuously. The fuel price fluctuations encourage\nthe use of renewable energy technologies, which offer stabilization of electricity costs [59]. The current\nprice of diesel in Iraq is about $0.4/L with some variability from time to time. To investigate the\neffect of diesel fuel variation on the system performance, a sensitivity analysis was done by varying\nthe price between $0.25/L and $0.55/L. The impact of diesel price variation on the NPC and CO2 is\ndepicted in Figure 20. It is obvious that with the rise in diesel fuel price from 0.25/L and $0.55/L,\nCO2 emissions decreased from 34,683 kg/year to 26,578 kg/year while NPC increased from $91,051\nto $126,989. These results can be explained by the fact that a rise in diesel price led to making the\nutilization of the diesel generator less competitive. Therefore, the generator working hours were\nreduced, which affected the optimal power flow of the system.\n \nFigure 20. Impact of diesel price on CO2 emissions and NPC.\n273\nSustainability 2019, 11, 683\n3.5.5. Load Consumption Growth\nThe output power of an energy system depends on the load requirements that should be satisfied\nall the time. If the load consumption increases, the energy production should imperatively be\nincreased. The load demand is usually varied from time to time. In this subsection, different load\nconsumptions (145, 150, 155, 160, 165, 170, 175, and 180 kWh/day) were considered to investigate\ntheir impact on the system performance. The effect of load consumption growth on the NPC and CO2\nis presented in Figure 21. The results indicate that NPC and CO2 of the system increased by 22.6%\nand 52.3%, respectively, when the load consumption increased from 145 kWh/day to 180 kWh/day.\nThe increments of NPC and CO2 were mainly due to the increase of the required capacity of the\ndifferent components of the system, including the diesel generator to increase the energy productions\nof the system.\n \nFigure 21. Impact of load growth on CO2 emissions and NPC.\n4. Conclusions\nOptimization of energy sources is a critical key in the assessment of the feasibility of HESs.\nThis study presents an optimal plan and design by providing a systematic techno-economic and\nenvironmental evaluation of a PV/diesel/battery off-grid configuration for a rural area in Iraq.\nThree different control strategies were proposed in this study, i.e., LF, CC, and CD. HOMER software\nwas used to evaluate the overall analyses, including the optimization and sensitivity. The cost analysis\nresults show that the combination of 19.4 kW PV, a diesel generator with a 21 kW capacity, 220 batteries,\nand an 8.05 kW power converter with the CD strategy was the optimal solution for this case study by\nhaving an NPC of $110,191 and a COE of 0.21 $/kWh, which were 20.6% and 4.8% less expensive than\nthe systems under the LF and CC strategies, respectively. Moreover, minimum fuel consumption made\nthe CD dispatch strategy the most suitable option for the environment, considering its CO2 emissions\nof 27,678, which were 1.7% and 23.9% lower than those of the LF and CC strategies, respectively.\nFurthermore, sensitivity analysis showed that variations in some important parameters, such as battery\nminimum SOC, time step, solar radiation, diesel price, and load growth, had significant effects on\nsystem performance. This study could play a vital role in decision making towards better energy\nmanagement strategies.\nAuthor Contributions: A.S.A. contributed theoretical approaches, simulation, and preparing the article; M.F.N.T.\nand M.R.A. contributed on supervision; M.A.M.R. and S.M. contributed on article editing.\n274\nSustainability 2019, 11, 683\nFunding: This research was funded by the Ministry of Education (MOE) Malaysia, grant number FRGS/1/2015/\nTK10/UNIMAP/03/2.\nAcknowledgments: The authors would like to thank the Universiti Malaysia Perlis and the Ministry of Higher\nEducation (MOHE) Malaysia for providing the facilities and financial support (Fundamental Research Grant\nScheme (FRGS) under a grant number of FRGS/1/2015/TK10/UNIMAP/03/2).\nConflicts of Interest: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\nReferences\n1.

This study builds a model that predicts the amounts\nof solar power generation using weather information provided by weather agencies. This study\nproposes a two-step modeling process that connects unannounced weather variables with announced\nweather forecasts. The empirical results show that this approach improves a base approach by wide\nmargins, regardless of types of applied machine learning algorithms. The results also show that\nthe random forest regression algorithm performs the best for this problem, achieving an R-squared\nvalue of 70.5% in the test data. The intermediate modeling process creates four variables, which are\nranked with high importance in the post-analysis. The constructed model performs realistic one-day\nahead predictions.\nKeywords: renewable energy; solar power generation prediction; smart grid; photovoltaic power;\nmachine learning\n1. Introduction\nA smart grid is an electrical grid system that manages energy-related operations, including\nproduction, distribution, and consumption. Efficient smart grid operations are aided by reliable power\nsupply planning. Supply planning on renewable energy operations, such as sunlight, wind, tides,\nand geothermal energy, involves a unique (unique class) class of prediction problem because these\nnatural energy sources are intermittent and uncontrollable, due to fluctuating weather conditions [1].\n(This paper is the expanded version of the cited conference paper.)\nThe photovoltaic geographic information system (PVGIS) [2] provides climate data and the\nperformance assessment tools of photovoltaic (PV) technology mainly for Europe and Africa. Based on\nhistorical averages, PVGIS offers a practical guideline for expected solar radiance in geological locations.\nAlso, many studies are conducted to predict the level of future solar irradiance or PV power generation\nin solar plants using weather information.\nSources of weather information include both measured weather records and weather forecasts.\nThis study finds that most previous studies have focused on exploiting only single source and that\nfew studies have attempted to utilize both information sources. Thus, this study proposes a novel\ntwo-step prediction process for PV power generation using both weather records and weather forecasts.\nThis study demonstrates the philosophy of data-driven modeling with as much relevant data as\npossible to improve model performance.\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1501; doi:10.3390/su11051501 www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability278\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1501\nPopular prediction methods for solar irradiance or PV power generation can be largely divided\ninto three categories [3]. The first category is physical methods that predict the future solar position\nand the resulting irradiance without relying on other climate data. Though the prediction of the\nsolar position can be significant, this approach is likely to overlook other relevant climatic conditions.\nFor example, the sky condition of clouds or rain blocks solar irradiance. The second category is\nstatistical methods, which can be further divided into classical methods and modern statistical-learning\nbased methods (also known as machine learning). With rapid developments of statistical learning\nmethods over the last decade, many studies have adopted this data-driven approach to developing PV\nprediction models [4]. Lastly, hybrid methods [5,6] apply not only statistical methods but also other\nmethods, such as mathematical optimization or signal processing.\nSince many studies using statistical learning methods have appeared, a paper reviewing these\nstudies is also published [4]. This review paper classifies the line of studies according to adopted\nmachine learning algorithms. However, no review study has attempted to discuss data sources of\nthe predictive studies in our knowledge. Needless to say, which data source is used in a data-driven\napproach is crucial to the model performance, so this study briefly reviews the sources of predictors\nused in existing papers.\nFirst, there is a group of studies that use recorded weather observations as key predictors. In the\ncase of using current weather as predictors, an implied hypothesis is that future irradiance and\nPV generation are related to the current weather. Studies in this stream adopt methods, such as\nneural networks [7], heterogeneous regressions [8], and deep belief network [9]. When the time\nspan of recorded weather observations is expanded, time-series analysis approaches are adopted,\nsuch as autoregressive moving average (ARMA) [10], autoregressive integrated moving average\n(ARIMA) [11\u201313], and a few variants of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [14,15]. These studies\nhave shown significant predictability. However, using only actual weather records is likely to be a\nsuboptimal strategy.\nInstead, utilizing weather forecasts that reliable weather agencies announce in punctual manners\nhas certain benefits. Thus, a greater number of studies adopt weather forecasts as primary predictors.\nThese studies [16\u201323] model future PV power generation using announced weather forecasts targeted\nfor the future time. Nonetheless, weather forecasts have some issues in terms of data quality. First,\nthey are not exactly accurate, and the weather agencies typically announce values under concerns of\nrisk averseness [24]. It may limit the performance of resulting predictive models that rely only on\nweather forecasts. Second, weather forecasts by weather agencies tend to include fewer variables\ncompared to weather records. For example, the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) (The\nKMA is the central administrative body of the Republic of Korea that oversees weather-related affairs.)\nannounces forecasts only for the surface temperature of the ground, while the KMA observes and\nrecords 10 cm-, 20 cm-, and 30 cm- underground temperatures as well. Lastly, due to the concerns\nabout inaccuracy, several variables in weather forecasts are announced in less fine units, often in the\nform of categorical variables instead of numerical variables. Regarding the quality of data alone,\nweather observation is, therefore, a richer and more accurate data source.\nDue to the pros and cons of weather observations and weather forecasts, we believe that these\ntwo data sources should be utilized in a complementary manner. In fact, a few studies [24,25] use\nboth observations and forecasts for prediction. Bacher et al. [25] propose an adaptive linear time series\nmodel whose autoregressive component for recent solar irradiation is supplemented by an exogenous\ninput of weather forecasts. Interestingly, they report that recent weather records are more important\nwhen the forecasting horizon is less than two hours. On the other hand, weather forecasts begin\ncontributing more when the forecasting horizon becomes longer than two hours. Detyniecki et al. [24]\nadopt a fuzzy decision tree learning that takes both weather forecast and weather observation into\ntheir input.\nThis study first built a base model that uses weather forecasts to predict solar power generation.\nThe focus was then moved to the existence of a set of the variables, which we call auxiliary variables,\n279\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1501\nthat are not included in weather forecasts but are observed by weather agencies. In particular,\nthe solar radiation among the auxiliary variables is known as a significant predictor for solar power\ngeneration [8,26]. Therefore, an auxiliary model identifies the relationship between weather forecast\nvariables and the auxiliary variables, then the main model for solar power generation uses both weather\nforecast variables and the auxiliary variables generated by the auxiliary model. In the language of\nstatistical learning, the base model aims to identify a regression function that relates the weather\nforecast variables and the solar power generation. The main model additionally incorporates the\nidentified relationship between the weather forecast variables and the auxiliary variables into the\nprocess of training another function. The auxiliary variables can be understood as latent variables\u2014not\ndirectly observable but can be inferred from attainable variables of weather forecasts.\nFigure 1 presents a graphical abstract of the models proposed in this study. Suppose the prediction\ntarget is for time t + 1 and the prediction is made at time t. Weather forecast\n^\nFt+1|t contains weather\nforecast variables announced by weather agency at time t, targeted for the weather at time t + 1.\nThe hat notation implies that this vector contains forecasted values. The base model f predicts\npower generation at time t, yt+1, from the weather forecast\n^\nFt+1|t. Weather observation Ot+1 contains\nvariables actually observed at time t + 1 but not forecasted by the weather agency prior to the time\nt + 1. Therefore, the auxiliary model identifies the best regression function g\u2217 from a parametrized\nfamily of g. Lastly, the main model uses\n^\nOt+1 = g\u2217(\n^\nFt+1|t) from the auxiliary model along with the\noriginal forecast\n^\nFt+1|t in order to predict power generation yt+1.\n \nFigure 1. The base model and the proposed two-step approach for solar power generation prediction\nbased on weather data.\nIn building the three prediction models, this study tests multiple machine learning algorithms that\nhave been frequently used for predictive analytics [4]. The tested algorithms include linear regression,\nsupport vector regression (SVR) [27], classification and regression tree (CART) [28], k-nearest neighbors\n(k-NN) [29,30], adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), random forest regression (RFR) [31], and artificial neural\nnetwork (ANN) [7,32,33].\nThe study contributes to the research lines in the following ways:\n\u2022 This study proposes an approach to expanding predictors for the prediction of solar power\ngeneration. It exemplifies a practical application to include relevant but delayed climatic data that\nare not available in real-time.\n280\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1501\n\u2022 Many practical applications, including renewable energy operations, call for predictions using\nweather information as predictors. The proposed approach can be applied to predictions for\nrenewable energy operations, such as wind, tide, and geothermal power production.\n\u2022 Generally, identifying latent variables and incorporating them in the prediction process often\nenhance the model performance. The proposed two-step approach does so with various machine\nlearning algorithms.\n\u2022 In applications of machine learning methods, identifying latent variable structures in prior\noften enhances the performance of resulting models. This study indirectly investigates how\nmuch each machine learning algorithm gains benefit from the intermediate latent variable\nidentification process.\n2. Materials and Methods\nThis section describes the data set and methods used to develop the models. Section 2.1 describes\nthe sources of the data and the preprocessing steps and Section 2.2 briefly explains the machine\nlearning algorithms used in this study. Section 2.3 finally formulates the prediction problems that the\nthree proposed models aim to solve.\n2.1. Data Collection and Preprocessing\nA solar power generation data from the Yeongam Photovoltaic Power Plant in South Korea were\ncollected from a publicly available database (http://www.data.go.kr) provided by the government.\nThe weather-related data were provided by the KMA. Solar elevation information was obtained from\na database by the Stellarium\u00ae.\nThe variables in the dataset can be divided into four categories as listed in Table 1. First, hourly\npower generation data were collected. The hourly data excluded daylight-free hours (00:00\u201308:00\nand 20:00\u201324:00) and were collected over three years from 2013-01-01 to 2015-12-31. Second,\nweather forecast data were collected. This study collected all available variables for the same period\nwhere power generation data were available during the corresponding period announced for the\nsame period. The constructed models predicted future power generation amounts using weather\nforecast data announced for the future period. The KMA announced short-term weather forecasts\nat the city or district level for each three-hour period from 02:00 each day. We used the forecast data\nannounced at 11:00 targeted for 09:00, 12:00, 15:00, and 18:00 of the following day (corresponding to 22,\n25, 28, and 31 hours after the announcement, respectively). Solar elevation data were collected from\nan open source program called Stellarium (www.stellarium.org). Specifically, we estimated the solar\nelevation (0\u25e6\u201390\u25e6) for the same period using the latitude 34.751702 and longitude 126.458533, which is\nthe geographical location of the power plant. The position of solar affects how much solar radiation\nenergy is collected at the ground, along with other weather conditions, such as rain, snow, cloud,\nand the density of air. Third, actual weather records were obtained. This study included all-weather\nobservation variables that were not included in weather forecasts. In the step of auxiliary modeling,\nthis study built a prediction model for the weather observation variables (Radiation, VaporPressure,\nSurfaceTemperature, and AtmosphericPressure) using weather forecast data, called auxiliary variables\nin this research.\nThe preprocessing task prepared the data into the structure suitable for quantitative modeling.\nCategorical variables in the weather forecasts, such as RainfallType, SkyType, and WindDirection,\nwere converted to multiple binary variables through one-hot coding. A week index variable (Weeknum)\nwas created to reflect seasonal changes. This variable assigns index sequentially from the first week to\nthe last week of each year. To include information about the time of the day, the variable TimeZone\nwas used to indicate three-hour intervals.\n281\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1501\nTable 1.

Machine Learning Methods\nThis subsection briefly describes the machine learning methods tested in this study. The methods\ninclude popular supervised learning methods in the research line [4]. Linear regression is a simple\nbut effective modeling technique where the linear relationship between independent variables and a\ndependent variable is to be identified. SVR is a variant of linear regression where prediction error that\nis smaller than some threshold is ignored in order to minimize the effect of outliers. Kernel functions,\nsuch as polynomial and radial basis functions, help the SVR perform the non-linear separation [26,34].\nANN is becoming an increasingly popular method for non-linear regression due to its effectiveness in\ndata prediction. To find the relationship between input and output nodes, multi-layered hidden nodes\nare connected and their weights are updated through the error backpropagation algorithm [6,31,32,35,36].\nCART, also known as recursive partitioning, splits an entire data set into two groups by searching for\nthe best split condition that can reduce the sum of squared errors (SSE) mostly. This binary partitioning\noccurs recursively until each leaf node reaches to have enough impurity [27,37]. k-NN is a non-parametric\nmethod used for classification and regression [28,29]. For each instance, the predicted value is based\non the weighted average value of the k neighborhood instances where each of the weight is commonly\ngiven as an inverse value of the distance between the target instance and each instance of the k nearest\nneighbors. Since k-NN treats input variables indiscriminately, this study scales and normalizes all the\ninput instances in a preprocessing step.\nAs a representative ensemble learning method, AdaBoost fits additional copies of the decision\ntree but with the weights adjusted to the error of the current prediction. By subsequently focusing\nmore on difficult instances, the learning mechanism boosts weaker learners to produce powerful\n\u201ccommittees\u201d [3]. Another powerful ensemble implementation is RFR, which consists of a collection of\ndecision trees that are built from each bootstrapping sampling of the entire data set [30]. Averaging\nvalues from each tree, RFR generates a prediction value.\nIn the post-analysis, this study measures the Gini importance or the mean decrease in impurity\n(MDI) as an important measure to investigate the effect of each predictor. The Gini importance is\ndefined as the total decrease in node impurity, averaged over all trees of the ensemble. By sorting the\npredictors using the Gini importance, the contribution of each predictor can be evaluated.\n282\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1501\n2.3. Problem Statements\nIn this study, we aimed to build a model that predicts solar power generation one day ahead\nof the actual operation. The base model identified the best function f \u2217 in which the predictors were\nlimited to the weather forecast variables.\nf \u2217 = argmin f L(yt+1, y\u0302t+1)s.t. y\u0302t+1 = f (\n^\nFt+1|t) (1)\nwhere\n^\nFt+1|t is a vector of weather forecast variables available at day t and targeted for day t + 1 (The\nhat notation emphasizes that this quantity is forecasted.), yt+1 is a quantity of power generation at day\nt + 1, and L is a cost function where this study adopted the measure of mean squared error (MSE) as a\npopular choice.\nThough a few variables in weather observation were missing in weather forecasts, this study\naimed to fully exploit weather information for building prediction process. That is, the weather\nobservation variables were predicted using weather forecast variables. This auxiliary model aimed to\nfind the best performing function g\u2217, such as\ng\u2217 = argming L(Ot+1,\n^\nOt+1)s.t.\n^\nOt+1 = g(\n^\nFt+1|t) (2)\nwhere Ot+1 is a vector of weather observation variables that are known to be related to solar power\nbut not included in weather forecast [7,25].\nFinally, the main model aimed to exploit the two previous models by including both\n^\nOt+1 =\ng\u2217(\n^\nFt+1|t) and\n^\nFt+1|t as predictors. The main model identified the best function h\u2217 such that\nh\u2217 = argminh L(yt+1, y\u0302t+1)s.t. y\u0302t+1 = h(\n^\nFt+1|t, g\u2217(\n^\nFt+1|t)) (3)\nwhere g\u2217 is obtained from the auxiliary model.\nThe base model provides a baseline for comparisons to the main model, which includes generated\npredictors. Since predictive relationships are complex and difficult to grasp, this study tests several\nmachine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, SVR, CART, k-NN, AdaBoost, and RFR,\nwhich are suitable for the structure of the data and the problem. Before applying the machine learning\nalgorithms, proper scaling is performed. Specifically, distance-based methods, including k-NN and\nSVR, need standardization so-called z-score normalization, in order to carry comparable importance\nin model generation process [34]. To calculate z-score, each variable x is subtracted by its mean \u03bc\nand divided by its standard deviation \u03c3, that is, z = (x \u2212 \u03bc)/\u03c3. ANN needs a min-max scaling to a\nbounded range, such as between 0 and 1, in these experiments. The normalized value can be calculated\nby (x \u2212 min(x))/(max(x) \u2212 min(x)). This step is necessary so that all variables are in a comparable\nrange before fed into a network [34]. Tree-based methods, such as AdaBoost, CART, and RFR, do not\nneed scaling since they bisect each variable in a non-parametric manner [34]. Linear regression does\nnot need to scale the data, either. By optimizing parameters under the train set, prediction models\nbased on each machine learning algorithm are built with the machine learning package in Python,\nscikit-learn [38].\n3. Results\nThis section presents the results of the methods described in the previous section. The results\nidentify (1) which machine learning method produces the best-performing model, (2) whether the\npredicted values for auxiliary variables created during the auxiliary modeling step have significant\nforecasting performance for solar power generation, and (3) how much each independent variable\namong weather forecast and weather observation contributes to prediction performance. Section 3.1\n283\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1501\nexplains the setting of experiments, Section 3.2 presents the performance of the auxiliary model\nformulated as Equation (2), and Section 3.3 compares performances of the base model in Equation (1)\nand the main model in Equation (3).\n3.1. Measures for Model Comparison\nTo build models, the data for three years were split to a training set (30 months; from 2013-01-01\nto 2015-06-30) and a test set (6 months; from 2015-07-01 to 2015-12-31). Using the train set, five-fold\ncross-validation was performed to find the best model for each prediction algorithm. The random\nsearch technique was adopted to search the proper parameter set of the best model.\nAn error measure of the mean squared error (MSE) was employed in choosing the best model among\ncandidates. Specifically, the MSE measures an average value of squares of errors, formulated as:\nMSE =\n1\nN\nN\n\u2211\ni=1\n(yi \u2212 y\u0302i)2 = RMSE2 (4)\nwhere yi is the i-th actual value, y\u0302i is the predicted value for yi, N is the number of samples, and RMSE\nimplies the square root of MSE. Along with the MSE, this paper presents two other error measures,\nthe R-squared value and the adjusted R-squared value. The R-squared value R2, also known as\nthe coefficient of determination, is the proportion of the variance of the dependent variable that is\nexplained by the independent variables.\nR2 = 1 \u2212 \u2211\nN\ni=1(yi \u2212 y\u0302i)2\n\u2211Ni=1(yi \u2212 y)2\n(5)\nwhere y is the mean of the actual values of y. The adjusted R-squared value, denoted R2adj, penalizes the\nnumber of independent variables used to generate the predicted value, after measuring the proportion\nof the variance explained by independent variables.\nR2adj = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 R2)\nN \u2212 1\nN \u2212 p \u2212 1 (6)\nwhere p is the total number of the independent variables in the model.\n3.2. Performance of Auxiliary Model\nThe proposed approach of this study features a two-step process, of which the first step predicts\nthe observed variables (O) using the forecast variables (\n^\nF). The intermediate result created by this\nauxiliary model with RFR is presented in Table 2. Among four auxiliary variables, the prediction made\non the first three variables, Radiation, VaporPressure, and SurfaceTemperature, are highly accurate\nwith R2 higher than 97%. The other variable AtmosphericPressure also has generally acceptable\naccuracy. Having these auxiliary variables is equivalent to having another set of weather forecast when\npredicting the future solar power generation.\nTable 2.

Performance of Base and Main Models\nFor the base model and the main model, popular machine learning algorithms in the line of\nstudies are applied. Table 3, sorted by MSE in the main model, presents performances in the test set.\nIt can be seen that R2 for the test ranges from 57.9% to 70.1% in the base model, and from 67.2% to\n70.5% in the main model. In the base model, RFR outperforms the others by large margins. Other\nmethods exhibit similar performance except that k-NN performs poorly. In the main model, RFR\nstill performs the best, but the margin is narrowed as other methods gain more from the two-step\nprediction process employed in the main model.\nTable 3.

The best performing algorithm, RFR, gains 0.4% improvement in R2.\nFigure 2. Improved prediction performance in terms of R2 from the base model to the main model.\nFigure 3 presents a time-series plot of predicted and actual values in a month (August 2015) of\nthe test set. The predicted values are produced by the best RFR model with a parameter fitted by\nlearning the train set. Overall, the predicted values track the fluctuations of actual power generation\nwell, except for a series of under-predictions for the peak hour in early days in August and a big\nover-prediction on the peak hours on 22 August which is unavoidable by an unpredicted weather\nevent. The day was unexpectedly foggy and heavily clouded (the maximally clouded day in August).\n285\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1501\nFigure 3. Actual values and predicted values by RFR from 1 August to 31 August 2015.\nIn the experiments on prediction models so far, all available variables in Table 1 are used.\nThe advantages of the two-step approach are validated under this untouched setting. As a post\nanalysis, the necessity of each predictor is assessed using a classical variable selection method, called\nbackward elimination. Backward elimination starts with all variables, and a single variable is removed in\neach step until doing so would reduce the overall performance of the model. A performance measure\nR2adj is used for this process, which penalizes the number of predictors so that a more concise model is\npromoted. Figure 4 presents which predictor is removed at each step.\nAll of 25 \nvariables \n = 0.695 \n \n \nExclude \nAtmosphericPressure \n = 0.703 \n \n \nExclude \nWindDirection1 \n = 0.711 \n \n \nExclude \nWindDirection2 \n = 0.713 \n \nFigure 4. Backward elimination process with the RFR model.\nThe process begins with 25 predictors, including binary dummy variables, generated from categorical\nvariables. This original model has a R2adj value of 0.695. Excluding AtmosphericPressure would enhance\nthe R2adj value to 0.703, yielding a prediction model with 24 predictors. This weather variable for sea-level\npressure turns out to be secondary to direct weather variables. Then, excluding WindDirection1 (West) and\nWindDirection2 (East) would enhance the R2adj value to 0.711 and 0.713, respectively. Winds blowing from\nNorth or South carry more information compared to the winds blowing from East or West. No further\nremoval is beneficial in terms of R2adj. This process ensures some redundant, highly correlated or ineffective\npredictors to be removed. After the backward elimination process, the final model contains the smallest\nnumber of essential variables, but still achieves high prediction accuracy.\n3.4. Importance of Variables\nThe above experiments demonstrate that the proposed two-step approach to solar power\ngeneration prediction improves the performance compared to the base model, regardless of the tested\nalgorithms. Another way to validate its benefits is to measure whether the auxiliary variables are\nindeed pivotal components in the main model. Determining the necessary predictors, the importance\nof each variable in the final model is examined in the next subsection. Because the RFR model performs\nbest, we adopt the Gini importance or mean decrease in impurity (MDI) as an important measure.\nThe MDI is defined as the total decrease in node impurity, averaged over all trees of the ensemble.\nBy sorting the predictors using the important measure, the contribution of each predictor is ranked.\n286\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1501\nFigure 5 presents the Gini importance of each variable in the main model with RFR. This figure\nsupports the hypothesis for the benefit in the two-step process. One of the auxiliary variable, Radiation,\nis the most important variable with the importance of 43.7%. Other auxiliary variables, such as\nSurfaceTemperature and VaporPressure, are ranked in the upper half among all variables. The top\nfour important variables consist of how much solar radiation is emitted (Radiation), from which\nsolar position (Elevation), at what time of the day (TimeZone5 and TimeZone3). The condition of the\nair (Humidity) and temperatures (SurfaceTemperature and Air-Temperature) also affect solar power\ngeneration. Sky condition of overcast (SkyType4) also plays a role.\n \nVariable Gini \nRadiation* 43.7% \nElevation 20.4% \nTimeZone5 9.2% \nTimeZone3 7.5% \nHumidity 5.0% \nSurface \nTemperature* 3.4% \nSkyType4 3.0% \nVaporPressure* 1.7% \nTimeZone4 1.2% \n(Air)-Temperature 1.0% \nWeeknum 1.0% \nWindSpeed 0.8% \nTimeZone2 0.6% \nRainfallType0 0.5% \nSkyType1 0.4% \nSkyType3 0.4% \nRainfallType1 0.1% \nWindDirection4 0.1% \nWindDirection3 0.1% \nSkyType2 0.0% \nRainfallType3 0.0% \nRainfallType2 0.0% \n* indicates an auxiliary variable. \nRadiation\n43.7%\nElevation\n20.4%\nTimeZone5\n9.2%\nTimeZone3\n7.5%\nHumidity 5.0%\nSurfaceTemperature\n3.4%\nSkyType4, 3.0%\nThe \nothers, \n7.8%\nFigure 5. Gini importance of variables in the main model based on RFR.\n4. Discussion\nFor the prediction of solar power generation during operations, weather forecast variables are\nreadily available. On the other hand, the auxiliary variables are not available to use. The auxiliary\nmodeling step utilizes the historical data to identify the relationship between available forecasts and\nsuitable predictions for the auxiliary variables. The generated predictions for the auxiliary variables\nusing available forecasts are highly accurate (see Table 2). The main model utilizes the predicted values\nfor the auxiliary variables along with available forecasts. On comparing the base models and the main\nmodels with popular machine learning algorithms, it is shown that the main models successfully\nimproved the performance of the base models (see Table 3, Figure 2, and Figure 3). Among the tested\nmachine learning algorithms, the models generated by RFR outperform the other models. The relative\nimportance for each predictor is identified (see Figure 5) after the removal of a few variables (see\nFigure 4).\nThe results can be interpreted as follows:\n\u2022 For predicting the solar power generation, the forecasts for the amount of solar radiation is the\nmost important among the others, in terms of the Gini importance. The forecast for solar radiation\n287\nSustainability 2019, 11, 1501\nis not directly available from the weather agency but can be indirectly generated by the proposed\nauxiliary model. Next, the position of the solar relative to the ground (Elevation) carries important\ninformation, and the operation time of the day affects the power generation. Since solar elevation\ncan be accurately forecasted by astrophysics and the time of the day (TimeZone) is deterministic,\nthe future information for these two variables are attainable accurately. The condition of the\natmosphere (Humidity and VaporPressure) and the temperatures (SurfaceTemperature and\nAir-Temperature) also affect the power generation.\n\u2022 Forecasts for auxiliary variables are not readily available during actual power generation\noperations, but their values are later realized and highly correlated to the solar power generation.\nThis relationship is captured by the auxiliary model, and the main model exploits this information\nto outperform the base model regardless of the machine learning methods applied. This approach,\nregarded as identification of latent variables, enhances the performances of solar power prediction.\n\u2022 On comparing the different machine learning methods, models with higher capacity, such as RFR,\nk-NN, and ANN, perform relatively well. RFR, the best performing method, is characterized by\nits ensemble approach with multiple randomized trees and known for its robustness in the test\ndata set. It is generally known that RFR is especially suitable when multiple categorical variables\nare involved, as in our case. The main results support the robustness and good performance\nof RFR.\n5. Conclusions\nThis study proposes a two-step approach to solar power generation prediction to fully exploit the\ninformation contained in the weather data. Specifically, the predicted values for auxiliary variables\ncontribute greatly to enhancing prediction performance.\nStudies in this line present a wide range of errors from 3% to 38% [4]. The large over-prediction on\n22 August due to an unexpected weather event (see Figure 3) indicates how the error distribution can\nbe highly skewed. Skewed errors result in lower overall accuracy, especially for the power plant located\nin areas of unpredictable weather. In particular, the power plant of this study is located in a landfill\narea in the southwestern part of the Korean peninsula, which is surrounded by three seas and 70% of\nwhose total area is mountainous, making weather predictions very difficult. To aid actual operations,\nit would be meaningful in future studies, especially for areas with low weather predictability, to present\nconfidence intervals of the predicted value, as well as the predicted values themselves.\nThis paper exemplifies a practical application of feature extraction such that latent variables,\nrelevant but delayed weather data in this study, are identified prior to the main modeling. This study\nvalidates that the process of latent structure identification improves the solar power generation problem\nand aids PV plant operations.\nFurthermore, other renewable energy operations, such as wind, tide, and geothermal power\nproduction, can also be benefitted from the proposed approach. More generally, it can also be applied\nto other fields that require predicting future weather conditions.\nAuthor Contributions: S.-G.K. and J.-Y.J. designed the research purposes and methodology; S.-G.K. developed the\nsoftware that is validated and further developed by M.K.S.; S.-G.K. and M.K.S. analyzed the data; S.-G.K. and M.K.S.\nwrote the original draft; M.K.S. and J.-Y.J. reviewed and finalized the draft.

Nowadays, modern approaches are getting popular to support engineers\nduring the design and development process of such multi-functional energy storage systems.\nNevertheless, these approaches still lack flexibility needed to accommodate changing practices\nand requirements from control engineers and along the development process. With that in mind,\nthis paper shows how a modern development approach for rapid prototyping of multi-functional\nbattery energy storage system applications can be extended to provide this needed flexibility. For this,\nan expert user is introduced, which has the sole purpose of adapting the existing engineering approach\nto fulfill any new requirements from the control engineers. To achieve this, the expert user combines\nconcepts from model-driven engineering and ontologies to reach an adaptable engineering support\nframework. As a result, new engineering requirements, such as new information sources and target\nplatforms, can be automatically included into the engineering approach by the expert user, providing\nthe control engineer with further support during the development process. The usefulness of the\nproposed solution is shown with a selected use case related to the implementation of an application\nfor a battery energy storage system. It demonstrates how the expert user can fully adapt an existing\nengineering approach to the control engineer\u2019s needs and thus increase the effectiveness of the whole\nengineering process.\nKeywords: energy management system; energy storage system; semantic web technologies; rules;\nontology; engineering support; smart grid architecture model; model driven architecture; IEC 61850;\nIEC 61499\n1. Introduction\nThe reduction of CO2 emissions is motivating the integration of renewables into power\ngrids. As a consequence, a higher penetration of distributed generators such as Photovoltaic (PV),\nwind turbines, and small hydro power stations is taking place [1]. A side effect of this is the\nperturbation of the power system stability and quality. Those issues were addressed by different\nstudies [2], which encourage the use of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). Moreover, BESS can\nalso support services related to the minimization of supply costs and market integration, among\nothers [3]. Consequently, BESS will play a multi-functional role in the near future. The BESS is often\naccompanied by an Energy Management Systems (EMS) where the BESS\u2019s services and functions are\nhosted. Hence, the EMS should exchange information with stakeholders and Intelligent Electronic\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4164; doi:10.3390/su10114164 www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability294\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4164\nDevices (IEDs) spread out over the electric grid. Thereby, the EMS development process should\nconsider interoperability across systems as well as evolving requirements of smart grid systems.\nIn this context, the realization of EMS involves challenging tasks, such as alignment with smart\ngrid information models, conflicts resolution within a multi-functional system, as well as handling\na diversity of tools for EMS validation. Different approaches handle these issues to different degrees as\ndemonstrated by Zanabria et al. [4]. Nevertheless, a full flexibility within a rapid prototyping context\nis still not covered by the mentioned approaches. This motivates the open issues addressed in this\nwork. An outlook of them is given below.\nAt the design phase, control engineers gather documents that encapsulate information regarding\nIED capabilities, network topologies, control applications structure, etc. Those documents are\nconsidered to provide important input for the EMS design. Thereby, a methodology that supports\nan automated treatment of this information to support the development process is necessary.\nSantodomingo et al. [5] process models based on the Smart Grid Architecture Model (SGAM) [6]\nand Use Cases defined with the IEC 62559 [7] standard to support network operators in selecting\nadequate technical solutions for their business needs. The referred study shows attempts to benefit\nfrom available information sources (SGAM models) in an automated way.\nAnother approach, the so called Energy Management System Ontology (EMSOnto) [8] also\nproposes a resolution of conflicts within an EMS [9]. Nevertheless, inconsistencies detected within\nBESS applications imply not only conflicts across Use Cases (UC) but also others such as incompatibility\nbetween a BESS and a service, misconfigured units, wrong write/red access permissions, etc.\nThis motivates to look for mechanisms that enable a customized identification of inconsistencies\nbased on evolving engineering requirements.\nWhat is more, due to control engineering practice and legacy solutions a variety of tools,\nprogramming languages and documents are likely to be employed during the validation phase.\nCurrent approaches [4] do not answer those requirements since models and code generated were tied\nto a specific platform. However, higher flexibility is expected in terms of software artifacts generation.\nFor instance, EMSOnto automatically generates code to be employed in a power system emulator\n(e.g., MATLAB/Simulink). Here, the compatibility with only one specific platform is provided. On the\nother hand, the rapid engineering methodology called Power System Automation Language (PSAL)\ngenerates models compatible with IEC 61499 [10]. However, also here, the generation of models in\nother specific platforms rather than IEC 61499 is not guaranteed.\nEMSOnto is one of the more suitable approaches that addresses the above mentioned issues in\na holistic manner. EMSOnto guides and supports control engineers during the design, proof-of-concept\nand implementation stages of BESS services and applications. Consequently, this work considers\nEMSOnto as reference framework to demonstrate how a flexible and automated engineering process\ncan be attained. By applying the outcomes of the current work to EMSOnto, an improved version of it\nwill be reached. Moreover, the proposed methodology may also be used to reinforce other modern\napproaches such as PSAL and SGAM.\nSince EMSOnto is taken as reference approach, the role of a new actor, the so called EMSOnto\nexpert user, is introduced to answer the exposed open issues. Thus, concepts from Model-Driven\nEngineering (MDE) and ontologies are combined to offer an adequate solution. The evaluation of the\nnew capabilities of EMSOnto is performed by the realization of a selected use case example. As a result,\nan acceleration in the realization of EMS applications is gained as well as a further identification of\ninconsistencies. Moreover, the achieved engineering process is flexible enough to be aligned with\ndifferent software platforms.\nThis paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the motivation of this work, the open issues\nto be addressed, and the role of control engineers in the scope of EMSOnto as well. In Section 3\nmechanisms to enhance the engineering process are introduced and discussed. A use case example\nis used in Section 4 to demonstrate how the control engineer\u2019s requirements are precisely addressed.\n295\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4164\nThereafter, in Section 5, a UC example is realized with EMSOnto to evaluate and analyze its new\nfeatures. Finally, Section 6 addresses the conclusions and discusses future needs.\n2. ESS Application Development Process Using Modern Engineering Approaches\nThis section defines the scope of the current work and outlines the engineering process of\nmulti-functional storage systems. Furthermore, an overview of different engineering approaches\nthat support the development process of BESS applications is also presented. Subsequently, issues\nnot yet addressed by those approaches are highlight. Since EMSOnto is considered to be the most\nadequate approach, the engineering process under the basis of EMSOnto is presented. Furthermore,\nthe open issues and research goals under the frame of EMSOnto are defined.\n2.1. Realization of Multi-Functional ESS Applications\nBESS are being used to enhance the power quality and to maintain the power stability,\namong others. This involves frequency and voltage control, self-consumption, peak-shaving,\netc. [3,11,12]. Those functionalities are usually embedded within an external system (e.g., EMS)\nthat controls active and reactive power of the battery to facilitate the referred services. Thereby,\na participation of different stakeholders is required, such as network operators, Energy Market\nOperator (EMO), or Distributed Energy Resources (DER), as outlined in Figure 1. As an example,\nthe UC Primary Control Reserve (PCR) [11] controls the active power of a BESS to support the\nregulation of the grid frequency. Thereby a communication of the EMS with a smart meter,\nnetwork operator and a BESS is needed. On the other hand, the UC minimization of costs with\npeak-shaving [12] would require a communication with a PV generator and households to measure\nthe active power generated and consumed.\nThe realization of EMS applications often follows certain stages, such as specification, design,\nimplementation, and proof-of-concept evaluation [13]. In the specification stage a definition of\nrequirements to be satisfied by an EMS is carried out. As a sequel, a conceptual design of EMS\nis elaborated, this implies the definition of control strategies and communication and component\narchitectures. The validation of the proposed control design is mainly carried out in offline power\nsystem simulators (e.g., DlgSILENT/PowerFactory) and controller platforms (e.g., IEC 61499) [14].\nOften the validation process entails an iterative refinement of the control application design.\nSubsequently, a prototype is realized and implemented within a real hardware controller.\n(e.g., voltage control)\nBESS\nBESS connected to the grid\nLow voltage grid\nEnergy Management System\nDER Load\nnetwork operator\nEMO\n(e.g. PCR)\nStakeholders\nCommunication link\nFigure 1. Framework of the BESS control applications.\n2.2. Application Engineering Using Modern Approaches\nThe engineering process of EMS can nowadays be supported by using modern development\napproaches [4]. Each of them tackles different specific issues. An analysis on how those approaches\nsupport the EMS development process is addressed as follows.\nAn approach called IntelliGrid (IEC 62559) [15] is mainly used to specify use cases and was\nsuggested by EPRI in 2003 to face the complexity involved within power systems. IntelliGrid is the\nmost used standard to describe smart grid use cases. The main outcome of IntelliGrid is a set of use\n296\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4164\ncase templates that guide engineers during the definition of business cases, use cases and requirements.\nThose templates are supported with a narrative and visual representation. The process involving the\nrealization of IntelliGrid templates is basically a manual work. This means that information sources\nsupporting the EMS specification (e.g., IED\u2019s models, component and communication architectures)\nare not automatically processed to fill out the templates. Besides this, the consistency of the information\ncollected by the referred templates is not verified. This may lead to unattended inconsistent data at the\nspecification stage.\nOn the other hand, the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is the most prominent general-purpose\nlanguage to specify and design use cases in an object-oriented approach [16]. UML provides different\nstructure (class, component, etc.) and behavior (sequence, activity, etc.) diagrams to allow a complete\nmodeling of use cases. Nowadays, UML is getting more attention also in the domain of power system\nto model smart grid solutions [17]. A different approach (SGAM) conceived to model smart grid\nprojects is recommended by [4]. SGAM provides a set of concepts, coordinated viewpoints and\na method to map use cases within a smart grid model. An implementation of SGAM is achieved by the\nSGAM-Toolbox (SGAM-TB), a UML-based domain specific language available as an extension of the\nEnterprise Architecture (EA) tool [18]. A drawback of both UML and SGAM is that the information\ngathered at the specification phase is not automatically processed to achieve important knowledge for\nthe design stage. This does not guarantee a consistency between specification and design stages.\nA holistic approach called PSAL has as main purpose the modeling of SGAM UCs and at the\nsame time provide automated support for rapid prototyping. To do this, PSAL provides a formal\ndomain specific language to describe smart grid systems. PSAL stands out from the previously\nmentioned approaches due to the rapid generation of software artifacts (code and communication\nconfigurations) offered. However, PSAL does not identify inconsistencies within the planned design.\nThis, in turn, is tackled by EMSOnto, an approach focused on the identification of conflicts and on\nthe rapid prototyping of multi-functional BESS applications. Nevertheless, EMSOnto lacks flexibility\ndue to the restricted set of inconsistencies detection offered. On the other hand, as already mentioned,\nEMSOnto and PSAL address the rapid generation of software artifacts. However, since the needed\ntype of software artifacts depend on the UCs to be implemented and on needed legacy solutions,\nit should be possible to support multiple target platforms. This feature is neither covered by PSAL\nnor EMSOnto. Currently, the generated models and code using PSAL are aligned to the automation\nstandard IEC 61499 and the communication model IEC 61850. EMSOnto currently only provides\ngeneration of code for the system simulator MATLAB/Simulink.\nThe mentioned open issues entail the setting of the following research goals: (i) benefit from\ninformation sources to automate the realization of design tasks, (ii) facilitate the deduction of\nknowledge to be customizable to control engineer\u2019s requirements, and (iii) generate software artifacts\nto support the whole engineering process. To meet those goals, EMSOnto is taken as the reference\nframework due to its completeness and holistic understanding. Hence, the solution proposed in this\nwork has been aligned to EMSOnto but should still be applicable not only to EMSOnto but also to\nother existent and upcoming approaches. The next paragraphs outline EMSOnto and formulate the\nalready mentioned open issues and research goals under the EMSOnto basis.\n2.3. EMSOnto Development Process\nAn overview of the work performed by control engineers on the frame of EMSOnto is shown in\nFigure 2. At the specification phase, engineers study the requirements to be fulfilled by the EMS and\nstarts a rough definition of the behavior and the structure of the EMS control applications. At this\nstage, different approaches such as SGAM, Unified Modeling Language (UML) and Systems Modeling\nLanguage (SysML) for system specification are employed [6,16].\nThe next step is the design of the EMS, which should be congruent with the specification already\ndefined. To this end, EMSOnto offers spreadsheet templates (EMS-templates) that collect and structure\nthe EMS\u2019s information. These spreadsheets have headlines with the attributes of functions and\n297\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4164\nvariables created in the scope of the EMS. Moreover, models of IEDs and UCs derived from smart\ngrids standards (e.g., Common Information Model, IEC 61850) are available within the UC and IED\nrepository. Those pre-built models ease the population of EMS-templates and thus compatibility with\nexistent information models is achieved.\nOnce the EMS-templates are completely filled a reasoner engine is executed resulting in the\nderivation of inferred data. The resulted data is queried to identify inconsistencies in the design,\na report form gathers those inconsistencies and is handled and analyzed by control engineers.\nThis analysis may lead to adjustments within the planned design. Therefore, at this stage\nEMS-templates are amended. This process is repeated until control engineers are satisfied with\nthe resulted design. In consequence, a consistent and less error-prone EMS is achieved before any\nimplementation. To support the proof-of-concept a set of software artifacts are made available to\ncontrol engineers.\nreport of \ninconsistencies \n \npopulation\n&\nmodification\ninference \nof knowledge \nDatabase\nEMS-templates \nInferred Database\npower system\nsimulator\nsoftware artifacts \nconfiguration file\npopulate\nspecification\napproach \nSpecification Design Proof-of-concept, Implementation \npopulatesmart gridmodels \nreports are analyzed  \nEMS-templates \n(inferred data) \nControl engineer\nUC & IED\nrepository\nuse knowledge\ndata is  \ntransformed\ncustomize the software artifacts \ncontroller platform\nFigure 2. EMSOnto in practice by control engineers.\n2.4. Open Issues\nEMSOnto was put in practice by control engineers in the scope of a large range of UCs [8].\nThose realizations raised a series of requirements understood as open issues within EMSOnto. They are\ndetailed as follows:\n\u2022 Information sources are not exploited: At the design stage control engineers dispose documents\nthat support the design of EMS. This may correspond to files describing IED capabilities,\nsmart grid use cases, communication networks, information models, etc. (e.g., IEC 61850,\nIntelliGrid, SGAM) [15,18,19]. Since those files contain requirements and important knowledge\nfor the design process, control engineers manually need to import selected data into the\nEMS-templates. This repetitive manual work is time consuming and exposed to human errors.\nHence, an automatic exchange between EMS-templates and other information sources is sought.\n\u2022 Restricted inference: EMSOnto supports the identification of conflicts between use cases. However,\nthis is not the only kind of inconsistency that would harm the suitable operation of EMS.\nFor instance, the setting up of IED registers with a wrong unit value would also impact the\ncorrect operation. Besides this, the inference of important data to support the design of EMS\u2019s\ncontrol strategies is also missed. Since knowledge to be inferred depends on engineer\u2019s needs\na flexible customization of EMSOnto to enlarge inferred knowledge is desired.\n\u2022 Limited generation of software artifacts: EMS-templates can be automatically transformed into\nmodels and code compliant with a specific power system simulator (i.e., MATLAB/Simulink).\nNevertheless, software platforms to be targeted depend on best practices established for testing\nand validation. In the power system domain, those platforms involve controller platforms,\nco-simulation platforms, communication network simulators, etc. (e.g., IEC 61499, Mosaik,\n298\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4164\nOMNET++) [20\u201322]. Therefore, generation of software artifacts, compatible with a large set of\nplatforms, should be guaranteed.\nSummarizing, taking all the open issues into account an adaptable engineering support framework\nfor ESS applications is required which is introduced and discussed in the following sections.\n3. Mechanisms to Automate and Increase Flexibility of EMSOnto\nThis section introduces the role of a new actor called EMSOnto expert, whose main focus is to\noffer mechanisms to overcome the aforementioned gaps. A detailed list of actions performed by the\nexpert is exposed as well as the foundations of the proposed solution.\n3.1. EMSOnto Expert Participation\nThe main key of EMSOnto is the conception of an ontology (EMS-ontology) which gives a common\nunderstanding of EMS control applications and the process to be controlled by them (e.g., BESS,\nsmart meter). A formal definition of the ontology is reached by Description Logics (DL) [23], a formal\nlanguage to model real systems, where the classification of common individuals is done by concepts\nand the relations between concepts are established by roles. DL languages comprises an assertional\ncomponent (ABox) and a terminological component (TBox). A TBox defines concepts, roles, and\nconstraints between them. In turn, an ABox asserts the membership of individuals in concepts and\nroles. On that basis, the EMS-ABox is populated by the EMS-templates and the EMS-TBox provides\na knowledge representation of EMS applications. The terms EMS-ontology and EMS-Tbox are used\ninterchangeably as well as EMS-templates and EMS-ABox. In this manuscript, concepts are indicated\nwith the font typewriter. A new actor, the EMSOnto expert, is introduced to expand the features of\nEMSOnto. The actions taken by the expert are depicted in Figure 3.\ninconsistencies  \nreport \ninference \nof knowledge \nEMS database \nconsistency \nchecking \nEMS-templates \n( ) \u0000\u0002\u0003 \u0000 \u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\nInferred database\npower system\nsimulator\nsoftware artifacts\ncontroller\nplatform\nreasoner \nspecification\napproach \nSpecification Design Proof-of-concept, Implementation \nsmart grid\nmodels \nTransformation \n \u0000\u0002\u0003 \u0000 \u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\n(inferred data)\n\b\u0005\u0006\u0007\nreasonner \nengine & \nrules to enlarge \ninference  \nquery\nset of queries\nTransformation \nEMSOnto expert\n2\n1\n3\n5\n1 documents\n4\nFigure 3. Tasks to be performed by EMSOnto expert.\n(1) Transformation across information: Control engineers make use of documents which contain\nspecifications regarding the EMS design (e.g., SGAM models), this information is gathered within the\nEMS-templates. Since EMS-templates are aligned to the EMS-TBox, the referred gathering process\ninvolves a matching between the information source, collected from specification approaches or smart\ngrid models, and concepts and roles defined within the EMS-TBox. For instance, EMS\u2019s structure\nrepresented by UML use case diagrams comprise the concepts UseCase, LogicalActor, etc. [16]. Hence,\na transformation of a UseCase instance requires a correspondence with the concept UC defined within\nEMS-TBox. This is possible since the UC and the UseCase represent the same information. A similar\nmechanism is applied for an automatic generation of software artifacts from EMS-templates. In such\na case, a transformation from EMS-ABox\u2019s individuals into models, code and text compliant with\nspecific platform environments is performed.\n(2) Adjustment of the EMS-TBox: Since the EMS-ABox should be consistent with the TBox,\nthe gathering of new assertions may impact the TBox. This applies to knowledge not modeled in the\nTBox but required in the transformation from or to other models. On the other hand, the inference of\nimplicit knowledge may also require an upgrade of the TBox. For instance, the detection of \u201cBESS that\n299\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4164\ndo not support the active power required by certain service\u201d would require to create the concept Pmax which\nsymbolizes the upper limit of an active power\u2019s value.\n(3) Creation of new rules: The reasons that motivated an extension of the EMS-TBox could require\nan improvement on the expressivity afforded by the EMS-TBox. This issue is tackled by rules which are\nused to improve the intelligence own by ontologies. Rules are composed of a premise and a conclusion,\nsatisfaction of the premise results in the derivation of implicit data or conclusions. As a result,\nany requirement involving complex inferences that are not achievable by the setting up of axioms\nwithin the EMS-TBox would be resolved by rules.\n(4) Upgrade of EMS-templates: As explained before, EMS-TBox is vulnerable to be extended due\nto inference of knowledge or software artifacts generation. Since an ABox should be consistency\nwith a TBox any modification to the EMS-TBox would also impact the EMS-ABox. This means that,\ninstantiations of new concepts and roles would require an upgrade of EMS-templates.\n(5) Set-up new queries: The detection of inconsistencies is based on a series of questions to be asked\nto the inferred EMS-ABox. Implementation of this is based on the formulation of query templates that\nmodel well-defined questions. Thus, the inferred data resulted from action 3 is queried and processed\nto collect important knowledge for the inconsistencies report, as shown in Figure 3. Besides that,\nqueries could also target inference of essential knowledge to support the EMS design.\n3.2. Transformation Mechanisms and Techniques\nThe tasks related to transformation of information across domains will be performed by MDE\ntechniques [24], where models are key players. Thereby, a model compliant with a UML class\nrepresentation is envisaged to represent the EMS-ontology. This model will be the essential part\nof the model transformations carried out along this work.\n3.2.1. Model-Driven Engineering in Power System Domain\nThe basics principles necessary to achieve the contemplated transformations between source\nand target data are covered by MDE approach [24]. This section outlines the concepts within MDE,\nbenefits of the approach as well as power system applications where MDE was implemented.\nThe main focus of MDE is the automation of a system development process. On that basis,\nMDE analyzes a development process in an object-oriented manner, resulting in the conception of\nmodels. Interoperability between models is reached by mapping rules. Which are defined under\nModel-to-Model (M2M) or Model-to-Text (M2T) transformations, also known as code generation.\nImplementation of MDE by the Object Management Group (OMG) goes under the name of\nModel Driven Architecture (MDA). Within MDA, the phases of a development process are supported\nby a Platform Independent Model (PIM) and a Platform Specific Model (PSM). PIM defines system\nfunctionality and is characterized by an independence with a specific platform solution. PIM is\ndeployed into a concrete platform (PSM) and usually PSM is translated into software artifacts (e.g., C++,\nJava code). M2M supports transformation from PIM to PSM and M2T from PSM into code.\nAn automated engineering method to support the complete development process of smart grid\ncontrol applications is provided by Pr\u00f6stl Andr\u00e9n et al. [10]. Power System Automation Language\n(PSAL) is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) and supports the design of UCs compliant with SGAM.\nMDE techniques are used to generate executable code and communication configuration scripts from\nUCs specifications. This is a holistic approach that covers the full engineering process.\nOn the other hand, Andr\u00e9n et al. [25] proposes an automatic generation of IEC 61499 compliant\ncontrol applications from IEC 61850 descriptions. This approach implements M2M and M2T\ntransformations. However, the obtained IEC 61499 system is not aligned to SGAM. Another study [26]\ndesigns a BESS control application within a power system emulator (Matlab/Simulink) for validation\npurposes and uses MDE to replicate the validated application into a controller platform (IEC 61499).\nThis study proposes a rapid prototyping that covers proof-of-concept and implementation. However,\nother stages of the engineering process such as specification and design were not considered.\n300\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4164\nFurthermore, [18] D\u00e4nekas et al. proposes the SGAM-Toolbox (SGAM-TB) by following the\nMDA approach. The SGAM-TB is implemented as an extension to Enterprise Architect (EA) and\ntherefore code generation is also possible. However, this code is not formatted to specific needs of\ncontrol engineers.\nSummarizing, apart from EMSOnto, PSAL is the only approach that offers a holistic approach.\nHowever, some gaps at the function and information layer of PSAL are covered by EMSOnto.\nThose gaps regard the identification of inconsistencies and the lack of a mechanism to gather unlimited\ndata. Those topics were tackled in the current EMSOnto. The new version of EMSOnto is formulated\nwith the aim of giving flexibility at all the stages of the engineering process. This flexibility is not\naddressed by any solution already presented and is going to conduct the research of this work.\n3.2.2. UML Representation of EMS-Ontology\nSince models are the main concept behind MDE, the conception of models across the full\ndevelopment process is a main task to be supported by the EMSOnto expert. In this light, a model of\nEMS-ontology is achieved and exposed in this section.\nOMG recommends the formulation of models by OMG specifications such as UML and SysML,\namong others [27]. UML, a widely used standard for describing structure and behavior of complex\nsystems is selected to represent the models. On the other hand, the expressiveness needed by the\nEMS-TBox is given by SROIQ(D), a logic defined within DL concept that provides complex role\ninclusion axioms, inverse roles constructors, qualify cardinality restrictions among others [28]. Thus,\nmapping rules to relate SROIQ(D) elements to UML metamodel elements are established to conceive\na UML model of the EMS-TBox, see Table 1. A DL concept is transformed into a UML class, a concept\nsubsumption into a UML generalization and so on, a practical implementation of those conversions\nis given in [29]. It is worth mentioning that the full TBox cannot be expressed by a UML class\ndiagram since not all the TBox axioms can be transformed into UML elements (e.g., transitivity axioms,\ncomposition role constructor). The resulted UML class diagram is presented in Figure 4 and goes\nunder the name of EMS-Data Model (DM). Only a simplify model is depicted. InformationFlow is\na new concept derived from the EMSOnto extension, it will be introduced later in the paper.\nSystem\nApplication\n+ hasType:\nHLUC PUC\nVariable\nInput Output\nUC\n+ hasName:\n+ hasDescription:\nEMS BESS PQ MSC\nFeedback Setpoint Control Status\n+ hasDiValue:\n+ hasTimeStamp:\n+ hasAnaValue:\n+ hasFormat:\n+ hasName:\nParam\nParamDevice\nInformationFlow\nParamUC\nhasVariable[0..*]\nhasApplication[0..*]\nhasVarValue[1..1]\nBinary\nVariableValue\nNumeric\nhasHLUC[0..*] hasPUC[0..*]\n\u0000 \u0000\n\u0000\nhasFlow[0..*]\nhasTarget[1..1] hasSource[1..1]\n\u0000\nFigure 4.

Analysis of a Use Case Example by an EMSOnto Expert\nDifferent mechanisms to enlarge the capabilities of EMSOnto were proposed above. This section\noutlines the role of the EMSOnto expert regarding the implementation of a specific UC.\n4.1. Use Case to Be Analyzed by the EMSOnto Expert\nThe UC Customer Energy Management System (CEMS) was implemented using EMSOnto\nas a basis [8]. SGAM is the preferred approach among smart grid specification approaches as\ndemonstrated in [4]. The SGAM information layer represent system\u2019s components as well as their\ninformation flows. Moreover, it combines domain-axis and zone-axis to structure smart grid control\napplications. For the CEMS in this UC, a detailed model is provided as an SGAM description, as seen\nin Figure 5. This shows the main CEMS\u2019s actors (i.e., BESS, CEMS, Meter, etc.) and the scope of the\nCEMS, which is located at the customer side and at the station level.\nThe CEMS is embedded with Frequency-Watt (FW) and Self-Consumption (SelfC) services.\nBoth services control the active power injected/subtracted by the BESS. To this aim, the signals State\nof Charge (SoC) (SoCbat) and active power (Pbat) are retrieved from the BESS. In turn, the frequency\n(Fgrid) and active power (Pgrid) at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC) are taken from a smart meter.\nGeneration of a PhotoVoltaic (PV) DER and the consumption of a household impact the behavior of\nthe CEMS. Thus, they are also considered during design stage. After execution of the SelfC and FW\nservices, a calculated active power setpoint (Pre f ) is sent to the BESS.\nGeneration Transmission Distribution DER Customer \nMarket \n \nStation \nEntreprise \nOperation \nField \nProcess BESS PV\nMeter\nCEMS\nLoad\nFigure 5. SGAM information layer representation of the CEMS (UC example) [8].\n4.2. Requirements from Control Engineers\nThe CEMS is implemented with EMSOnto. Control engineers in charge of the implementation\nemploys specific tools for power systems emulator (MATLAB/Simulink) and controller platforms\n(IEC 61499 platform) [20,30]. Furthermore, not only specific tools but specific documents (IEC 61850\nSCL files, SGAM models) were used for the description of IED\u2019s functionalities and control applications\narchitecture. This is due to common practices of control engineers. Nevertheless, other tools and\nframeworks are also available to support the engineering process of power systems (e.g., Modelica\n302\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4164\nand IEC 61131-3) [31,32] as well as other information models for smart grid networks (e.g., CIM) [33].\nThe fact of using specific tools to evaluate the proposed methodology would enable a concrete\nunderstanding of the actions taken by the EMSOnto expert.\nA series of requirements that motivates an expansion and customization of EMSOnto were figured\nout by control engineers. These requirements are bound to specific tools, documents and information\nmodels as exposed below.\n(R1) Benefiting from SGAM models: CEMS is roughly described at the specification stage by\nmeans of the SGAM-TB. The information added at that stage is reused at design time to fill the\nEMS-templates. Therefore, an automatic import of SGAM models into EMS-templates is expected with\nthe aim of reducing the manual work conducted by control engineers.\n(R2) Discovering CEMS constraints: The controlled process (i.e., the BESS) is surrounded by\nconstraints that characterizes technical limitations of electrical devices and/or safety restrictions.\nThose constraints need to be considered during design of control strategies. Therefore, an understanding\nof them is absolutely required during design time. Hence, an automatic retrieval of constraints from the\nprocess is expected.\n(R3) SoC estimator function generation: In the scope of multi-functional BESS, the battery\nprovides support not only to an individual service, but more than one. In this context, a solution to\ntrack the delivered active power of the BESS to a specific service is performed by control engineers.\nThis consists on the calculation of SoC per service by a function called SoC_estimator. As a result,\nthis function is implemented whenever a UC controls a BESS. Hence, an automatic generation of the\nSoC_estimator function is sough in the scope of R3.\n(R4) Generation of configuration files: EMS and IEDs need to be parametrized and customized\nto specific requirements and initial state values. A selection of parameters is gathered in a sort of\nconfiguration file that is filled out before any execution or simulation of the mentioned systems.\nThese configuration files support the validation of the EMS through the proof-of-concept and\nimplementation phases. R4 seeks for an automatic generation of such files, which should expose the\nparameters of functions to be deployed within an EMS as well as the IED\u2019s parameters.\n(R5) Identification of batteries mismatching services: A service that request BESS support would\nask to fill certain requirements such as capacity (kWh), maximal power provision (kW), activation time\n(s) [34,35]. Thus, not all the BESS would pass the pre-qualification procedures defined by network\noperators. BESS able to participate in Primary Control Reserve (PCR) should provide certain power.\nA report that identifies BESS that do not meet this requirement is expected.\n(R6) Generation of IEC 61499 models: The design of CEMS is validated within a power system\nemulator as part of the proof-of-concept. Following this step, the implementation of it is performed\nwithin a controller platform fully compliant with IEC 61499. On the other hand, some components of\nthe CEMS (e.g., communication interfaces, control logic) were directly tested in the controller platform.\nThis motivates an automatic generation of the IEC 61499 control application either from EMS-templates\nor from the MATLAB/Simulink project.\n(R7) Benefiting from IEC 61850 ICD files: Power system information models hold data important\nfor the IDE and UC repository. In the scope of CEMS, Information Capability Device (ICD) files\nare handled to control engineers. ICD files are XML-based, which serialize information regarding\nfunctions supported by an IED and are often supplied by the IED manufacturer. Thus, R7 seeks for\nan automated import of ICD files into the repository.\n(R8) Identification of misconfigured units: An EMS controlling and monitoring an IED\n(e.g., BESS) should be aligned to the units of the IED. In other words, a control signal targeting\na setpoint should respect the units of the value to be targeted. Otherwise, a wrong value would be\nset. This applies also to a status been monitored by feedback. For instance, a BESS is providing its\nSoC status (SoCbat), which has the value of 80%. An EMS retrieving this value may expect raw data\nbetween the range 0\u20131 (0.8). This mismatch between units would cause a wrong behavior of the EMS.\nHence, an identification of such inconsistencies is fundamental.\n303\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4164\n4.3. Analysis Phase: Analysis of Requirements\nAn analysis of the mentioned requirements determines the actions to be performed by the\nEMSOnto expert. This analysis is structured under a succession of steps. The first step corresponds\nto investigate where the transformation across data models takes place. This corresponds to R1,\nR4, R6 and R7. Those requirements involve different data models that need to be interrelated with\nEMS-DM. Therefore, data models of SGAM, IEC 61850, IEC 61499 and Matlab/Simulink are studied\nand an alignment of EMD-DM to the referred data models is sought. Following this, classes and\nassociations not considered within EMS-DM are created and added to it, affecting the EMS-TBox.\nThe next step is to identify requirements clearly connected to the inference of knowledge. R2, R3,\nR5 and R8 correspond to this category. A complete understanding of the knowledge to be inferred in the\nscope of those requirements is needed. Thereby mathematical models representing constraints within\na control application (R2) are investigated as well as models that drive the operation of SoC_estimator\nfunction (R3). Furthermore, an understanding of technical limitations within a BESS are also needed\n(R5) just as information models that conduct the structure of sources and targets defined within\ninformation flows (R8). In the aftermath, the TBox is again extended to cope with R2, R3, R5 and R8.\nEventually, the creation of queries and rules could also take place.\n4.4. Realization Phase: Implementations Performed by EMSOnto Expert\nThe actions taken by EMSOnto expert are highlighted and enumerated in Figure 6. The first step is\ndedicated to the creation of new concepts, roles, and constraints within the EMS-TBox. The expressivity\nof EMS-TBox depends on the ontology language used to implement it (e.g., OIL, DAML+OIL,\nOWL 2 [36]). In case that a higher expressivity is needed the implementation of rules is carried\nout as part of the next step.\nSGAM \nToolbox \nSpecification Design Proof-of-concept, Implementation \n ( ) is \nanalyzed by\nbased on\nEMS \ndata base \n( ) \ninferenceOWL ontology SWRL rules \nEMS \ndata base \n(inferred) \nis queried and  \nprocessed by\ngeneration\nSPARQL\nqueries &\nprocessing of\ndata by JAVA \ngenerate\nTransformation \nrules \n(M2M, M2T) \nIEC 61499\nfunction blocks\npopulateSGAM to  \nFunction blocks \nconfiguration\nscripts \n4 M2M tranformation between SGAM and EMS-DM \n2 \nextension of  : \n  \n5 mappings between IEC61850 and EMS-DM \nmapping LN to \n \n6\ndefinition of\nSPARQL queries \ncreation of new\ntemplates for code\ngeneration \nmapping between\nEMS-DM and IEC\n61499 \n7\n3 new templates to build EMS-  \n \nSWRL rules:  \n1 \nreports\nUC & IED\nrepository \nICD file \nFWHZ \nLogical node \nEMSOnto\nexpert\nEMSOnto\nexpert\nFigure 6. Design and Implementation of CEMS UC\u2014 automated by EMSOnto expert.\nAs a sequel, population of the EMS-TBox is done against assertions of the CEMS use case,\nhence, CEMS knowledge is collected within EMS-templates. EMS-templates are complemented\nwith the information from SGAM models and ICD files. To achieve this, a mapping between the\nSGAM model and the EMS-DM is performed, as well as a transformation between IEC 61850 models\n(ICD files) and EMS-DM. When a complete ABox is reached the inference of knowledge takes place.\nQueries are built upon the inferred knowledge to allow the identification of inconsistencies. Finally,\nthe EMSOnto expert establishes M2M and M2T transformation to generate software artifacts as\ndepicted in Figure 6. The implementation of the aforementioned actions are carried out by Semantic\nWeb Technologies, ontology editors and programming frameworks. A detail of the aforementioned\nactions is addressed below.\n4.4.1. Action 1: Extending the EMS-Ontology\nOntology Web Language (OWL) 2, a popular ontology language recommended by the World Wide\nWeb Consortium (W3C) is chosen to implement the expressivity required by EMS-TBox (SROIQ(D)\n304\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4164\nlogic) [37]. OWL 2 is based on SROIQ and furthermore it supports data types. Thus, a complete\nimplementation of the TBox is reached. On that basis, concepts, roles, and axioms not considered\nwithin the EMS-TBox are investigated and addressed in this section.\nR1 seeks to benefit from UML behavior and structure diagrams specified with the SGAM-TB.\nBecause of that, a concordance between SGAM-TB and EMS-DM should be reached. The EMS-DM\nfocuses on function and information aspects of smart grid control applications. Thereby, the business,\ncommunication, and component SGAM layers are out of the scope. The function analysis of\nSGAM-TB involves different concepts, such as High-Level Use Cases (HLUC), Primary Use Cases (PUC),\nLogical Actors (LA) [38]. Those concepts are already included in the EMS-DM. However, the concept\nInformation Object (IO) that represents communication between LAs and PUCs was not yet addressed.\nHence, it is added to the EMS-DM under the name of InformationFlow, which stands for the UC\u2019s\ninformation that relates one Output to one Input as exposed in Table 2 and Figure 4.\nTable 2. Terminological axioms to align EMS-DM with SGAM model.\nConcepts, Roles, OWL Axioms Description\nUC \u0010 \u2203hasFlow.In f ormationFlow \u0012 . . . ,\nIn f ormationFlow \u0010\u2264 1hasSource.Output\u0012\n\u2264 1hasTarget.Input \u0012 \u2203hasSource.Output\n\u0012\u2203hasTarget.Input\nInformationFlow represents information exchanged between UCs.\nHence, the role hasFlow relates the concepts UC and InformationFlow.\nInformationFlow owns one Output as source and one Input as target.\nA formal representation of this requires the use of qualified number\nrestrictions constructor (\u2264 n R.C, R is a role and C is a concept) [23].\nAn investigation of mathematical models for IEDs is carried out in the scope of R2. For simplicity,\na single-output and single-input process is represented in state space as shown in Equation (1). Where u\nis the input variable, y is the process output and x the state vector with dimension n \u00d7 1 that represent\nthe entire state of the process at any time. In the scope of our study, the process is represented\nby electrical devices connected along the low voltage distribution grid, such as BESS, PV, load, etc.\nThese processes are frequently surrounded by constraints on control variables (u), state variable\n(x), or output (y), as described by Equation (2). A control application (i.e., CEMS) that intends to\nmanipulate outputs of the process (y) needs to respect the referred constraints.\nFrom an IED\u2019s perspective, an instantiation of previous data with EMS-TBox concepts is\nachievable: Setpoint (u), Manipulated (y), State {x1, . . . , xn}, Constraint {umax, . . . }. In this work,\nonly constraints on setpoint variables (umin, umax) are inferred, the others (e.g., ymax) follow a similar\nmechanism. On that basis, the CEMS infers constraints from the IED\u2019s setpoints. To achieve this,\nthe concept Constraint is further developed as depicted in Table 3, where Variables defined within\na Constraint are modeled as well as the relation between Constraints.\nx\u2032 = Ax + Bu, y = Cx + Du, x = [x1 . . . xn]T (1)\nxmin \u2264 x \u2264 xmax, umin \u2264 u \u2264 umax, ymin \u2264 y \u2264 ymax (2)\nTable 3.

The inverse role of hasConstVar is given by\nhasVarConst.

A Variable can inherit Constraints from other\nVariables, this inference is achieved by complex role inclusion\naxioms (R1 \u25e6 R2 \u0010 R3, being R1, R2 and R3 roles).\n305\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4164\nThe generation of the SoC_estimator function is contemplated in R3. Thereby, an analysis\nof data that conforms such function is carried out. Considering a HLUC controlling the active\npower supplied by a BESS, the calculation of HLUC\u2019s SoC (SoChluc) follows the logic in Equation [3].\nSoChluc depends on the SoC initially assigned to the HLUC (SoCini), the current charged into the BESS\n(Ibat), as well as the total capacity of the BESS (Qbat) and a portion capacity assigned to the HLUC (Qhluc).\nThe value Ibat is calculated from the active power (Pbat) and the nominal voltage (Vnom) of the battery.\nA modeling of the mentioned variables results in the following instantiations: State{Vnom, SoC},\nParamDevice{SoCini, CAh} and ParamUC(CAh_UC). Nevertheless, a further representation of those\nvariables is required, resulting in new concepts. For instance, the concept Vnom represents nominal\nvoltages and is subsumed by State. A detail of all those new concepts is given in Table 4.\nOn the other hand, the creation of new roles facilitates the generation of SoC_estimator. Hence,\nControlBESS relates a UC controlling a BESS and the concrete role hasI_O facilitates a remote control of\ninternal variables defined within the scope of a UC as detailed in Table 4.\nSoChluc = SoCini +\n\u222b Ibat\nQbatQhluc\n, Ibat =\nPbat\nVnom\n(3)\nTable 4.

Thereby, variables\naffected by this role are those subsumed by Internal (Param,\nState, . . . ).\n4.4.2. Action 2: Enlargement of Inference Process\nThe inference of data reached by OWL ontologies can be extended by Semantic Web Rule\nLanguage (SWRL). This concept is standardized by W3C as language for expressing rules and\nprovides powerful deductible reasoning mechanisms compared to OWL. SWRL is based on OWL\nDL, Datalog and Horn-like rules [39]. As a result, the syntax of SWRL is represented by atoms,\nrule body (antecedent) and rule head (consequent): Atom \u2227 Atom \u2227 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2192 Atom. If the conditions on\nthe antecedent hold, then also the conditions in the consequent hold. On that basis, SWRL rules r1\nand r2 are designed to support the identification of CEMS\u2019s constraints, as shown in Table 5. Where r1\ndeduces Variables assigned to Constraints and r2 infers relations between Constraints.\nTable 5. Rules to infer CEMS\u2019s constraints.\nSWRL Rules Description\nr1: Control(?x1) \u2227 IsAssignedTo(?x1, ?s) \u2227 Setpoint(?s)\n\u2227hasVarConst(?s, ?c1) \u2227 Constraint(?c1) \u2192 hasVarConst(?x1, ?c1)r\nA Control inherits constraints assigned\nto the Setpoint that it targets. A setpoint\nvariable ?s owns the constraint ?c1, if ?s\nis controlled by ?x1, then ?x1 inherits the\nconstraint ?c1.\nr2: Constraint(?c1) \u2227 hasConstVar(?c1, ?x1) \u2227 IsVarLinkVar(?x1, ?x2)\n\u2227Variable(?x1) \u2227 Variable(?x2) \u2227 hasVarConst(?x2, ?c2)\n\u2192 IsConsLinkCons(?c1, ?c2)\nThe role IsConsLinkCons is established\nwhen a relation between Costraints is\ndetected.\n306\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4164\nOn the other hand, certain rules that requires the creation of new instances, in the consequent\nthat these do not appear in the antecedent, are not possible by SWRL. In those cases, SPARQL Update\nqueries are used instead [40]. SPARQL Update is a standard language that executes updates to triples\nin a graph store. It uses the data operators INSERT and DELETE for inserting and removing triples.\nFollowing that, mechanisms to generate the SoC_estimator function use r3 to identify when a HLUC\nis controlling a BESS by means of ControlBESS. As a sequel, r4 attaches a new PUC (SoC_estimator) to\nthe identified HLUCs. Finally, r5 is responsible for the connections across the BESS, the HLUC and the\ncreated PUC (SoC_estimator). Those rules are detailed in Table 6.\nTable 6.

The name assigned to the new PUC is\na concatenation of HLUC\u2019s name and the string \u2032_SoC\u2032.\nFor instance, a PUC called FW_SoC is assigned to a\nHLUC(FW) named FW.\nr5: PREFIX CEMS :< http : //.../CEMS# >\nINSERT{\n?x5 CEMS:IsAssignedTo ?x4. }\nWHERE{\n?x1 CEMS : ControlBESS ?x2.\n?x1 CEMS : hasPUC ?x3.\n?x3 CEMS : hasType \u201dSoC_estimator\u201d\u2227\u2227xsd : string.\n?x3 CEMS:hasFeedback ?x4.\n?x4 CEMS : hasType \u201dVnom\u201d\u2227\u2227xsd : string.\n?x2 CEMS:hasStatus ?x5.\n?x5 CEMS : hasType \u201dVnom\u201d\u2227\u2227xsd : string }\nA BESS\u2019s Status is assigned to a Feedback of the\nfunction PUC(SoC_estimator). For simplicity, only\nthe inference of relations between BESS\u2019s Vnom and\nPUC(SoC_estimator) are shown. Thus, since Vnom is\nneeded to calculate SoChluc, a role IsAssignedTo\nrepresenting the relation of Status(Vnom) and\nPUC(SoC_estimator)\u2019s Feedback is established.\n4.4.3. Action 3: Setting up of New EMS-Templates\nThis section addresses all the modifications carried out along EMS-templates to keep a consistency\nwith the extended EMS-TBox. The extended headlines are highlight with blue color.\nThe detection of CEMS\u2019s constraints would need to gather instances of these general statements:\na UC (s) contains a Setpoint (x), which in turn is constrained by Constraint (C1). Moreover,\na Constraint (C1) is related to a Constraint (C2). Thereupon, an extension of the spreadsheet\ntemplate collecting the UC\u2019s attributes is performed and resulted in Table 7. Moreover, the field\nConst_Description is included to gather constraint\u2019s descriptions.\n307\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4164\nTable 7. Extension of EMS-templates to collect constrains of a variable.\nUC Variable Description Type Const.

Nevertheless,\nthose models need to be extended to achieve the implementation of the SoC_estimator as shown in\nTable 8. For instance, the concept CAh_UC that represents the capacity assigned to a UC is now included\nin the UC(UC_generic), just as the CAh concept in the UC(BESS). Besides this, a complete model of\nPUC(SoC_estimator) is also required, see Table 9. All the extended models are made available in the\nIED and UC repository. Hence, control engineers are free to edit all the fields except Type.\nTable 8.

Action 4: Mapping Between SGAM-TB and EMS-DM\nThe exchange of data between SGAM models and EMS-templates is addressed using MDA\ntechniques. Hence, a model of SGAM-TB is investigated and proposed in this section.\nA UML class representation of SGAM-TB is suggested by Neureiter et al. [38]. Such representation\nmotivates the SGAM-TB model proposed in this work. It is worth highlighting that only function\nand information layers are modeled. The function layer of SGAM-TB involves description of main\nfunctionalities within the concept HLUC, further details of HLUCs are given in PUC. Actors involved\nwithin those PUCs are modeled by the LogicalActor. In turn, the information layer includes the\nInformationObject a concept representing any information flow. Which is structured by a data model\n(DataModel). The aforementioned concepts are combined to conceive a UML class representation of\nSGAM-TB, see Figure 7a. Considering this, classes, attributes, and other components of SGAM-TB\nmodel are transformed into EMS-DM components, as shown in Figure 7b. For a straightforward\ninterpretation only the mapping between classes is depicted.\n308\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4164\nSystem\nBUC\nHLUC\nPUC\nBusinessActor\nLogicalActorInformationObject\nUC\nOutportInport\nDataModel\nhasBUC[0..*]\nhasHLUC[0..*]\nhasPUC[0..*]\nIsRelatedToLA[0..*]\nhasLATarget[0..*]\nhasLASource[0..*]\nImplement[0..*]\nhasIO[0..*]\nhasDataModel[1..1]\n\u0000\nhasLA[0..*]\nIsRelatedToUC[0..*]\n(a)\nSGAM-TB EMS-DM\nSystem System\nHLUC HLUC\nPUC PUC\nLogicalActor Application\nInformationObject InformationFlow\nInport Input\nOutport Output\n(b)\nFigure 7.

Action 5: Mapping Between IEC 61850 an EMS-DM\nThe IEC 61850 approach is object-oriented and has been lately used in power system domain\nto improve interoperability between IEDs. The abstraction of services provided by an IED begins\nwith a Logical Node (LN), which models services for protection, measurement, control, etc. Each LN is\ndefined as a class within the IEC 61850-7-4 specification [41]. Data Objects (DO) refine the definition of\na LN, they are specified by Common Data Classes (CDC) in IEC 61850-7-3 [42].\nOn the other hand, IEC 61850 defines a language to configure IEDs under the name of System\nConfiguration Language (SCL) in IEC 61850-7-6. An SCL specifies the capabilities of an IED by LN\nclasses, which are of type LNodeType. Each of them contains DOs of type DOType which in turns contain\nDAs of type DAType. A LNodeType should correspond to a LN as well as a DOType to a CDC.\nThe instantiation of the mentioned classes is exemplified by the LNodeType:MMXU, see Figure 8.\nThis notation (class:individual) is employed to assign an individual to a class. The mentioned\nLNodeType represents a calculation of current, voltage, frequency, etc. Thereby, it contains among\nothers the DO:Hz for frequency measurement. This DO contains DA:mag to abstract the mean value of\nthe frequency.\nOn the basis of SCL representation, the mapping between EMS-DM and IEC 61850 is carried\nout as follows: a LNodeType is transformed into a UC and a DO into a Variable. The type of Variable\n(i.e., Feedback, Control, etc.) to be generated is obtained from the attribute cdc within DOType. Hence,\na MV (Measured Value) results in a Status assigned with a Numeric value. The DAs elements of\na DOType (i.e., t, mag, units, etc.) are mapped into the attributes of Numeric (i.e., hasTimeStamp,\nhasAnaValue, hasUnits, etc.). Those mappings are referenced by color match in Figure 8.\nIn the previous example a DO:Hz representing a MV resulted in a Status. However, a DO may belong\nto the other types such ASG (Analogue Setting) or SPS (Single Point Status) among others. Depending\non that, a generation of either a Setpoint or Status, etc. is performed. It is worth highlighting that\nnot all the DAs of a DOType can be mapped into the EMS-DM. For instance, the DA:q that represents the\nquality of the information is not mapped. To accomplish that, an extension of attributes assigned to\nVariable is required. As a summary, any IED functionality defined within a LN is translated into a UC\nand upload into the repository.\n309\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4164\nLNodeType\n+ lnClass: \"MMXU\"\n+ desc: \"Measuring\"\n+ id: \"MMXU_0\"\nDOType\n+ id: \"MV_0\"\n+ desc: \"Measured value\"\n+ cdc: \"MV\"\nDA\n+ name: \"mag\"\n+ fc: \"MX\"\n+ type: \"AnalogueValue_0\"\nDAType\n+ id: \"AnalogueValue_0\"\nBDA\n+ name: \"f\"\n+ bType \"FLOAT32\"\nIEC 61850 \n(UML class diagram) \nNumeric\n+ hasTimeStamp: Date\n+ hasAnaValue: Double\n+ hasUnit: String\n+ hasMin: Double\n+ hasMax: Double\nhasVarValue\nStatus\nhasVariable\nUC\n+ hasName: String\n+ hasDescription: String\nhasVariable[0..*]Variable\n+ hasName: String\n+ hasDescription: String\nEMS-DM \n (UML class diagram) \nVariable_value\nMV\n+ mag: AnalogValue_MX[0..1]\n+ units: Unit_CF[0..1]\n+ t: TimeStamp_ST[0..1]\n+ rangeC: RangeConfig\n+ q: Quality_MX_qchg\nDO\n+ name: \"Hz\"\n+ desc: \"Frequency\"\n+ type: \"MV_0\"\nCDC\nmapping\nLN\n61850-7-4\nMMXU\n+ Hz:MV\n61850-7-3\n61850-7-6\nFigure 8.

Action 6: Generation of Inconsistency Reports\nThe identification of certain inconsistencies may require the extension of the EMS-TBox as well as\ndefinition of new rules and queries besides adjustments to the EMS-templates. However, the fulfillment\nof R5 and R8 requires just the elaboration of new queries, those are addressed as follows. In the scope\nof R5, constraints on a BESS are analyzed. The active power value of a battery is limited as shown\nin Equation [4]. The identification of services that attempt to control Pbat with values that exceed the\ntechnical limits requires the modeling of Pmax. Besides this, the power demanded by a service is also\nneeded (BessSize). Those concepts were already included in the EMS-TBox.\nA formalization of competency questions is achieved by DL or SPARQL queries [43]. This depends\non the type of question, usually elaborated questions need the expressivity of SPARQL syntax. In turn,\nsimple questions can be formulated by DL. On that basis, R5 implies DL queries to answer questions\nabout BESS\u2019s restrictions and UC\u2019s parameters, see Table 10.\nPmin < Pbat < Pmax (4)\nTable 10. Querying the EMS-ABox to identify batteries mismatching services.\nQuery Question DL Query\nQI What is the variable of type Pmax defined within a BESS(battery)? Pmax \u0012 \u2203hasParam\u2212.BESS{battery}\nQII What is the active power to be required by a service HLUC (Servicen)? BessSize \u0012 hasParam\u2212.HLUC{Servicen}\nOn the other hand, since R8 investigates misconfigured units, an analysis of the information\nflow is required. An information flow is conformed by a source and a target. A source can be of\ntype Control and Output. In turn, a target is of type Setpoint and Feedback. Units of the source\nshould match the units configured at the target. Enough information is already provided within the\nEMS-templates to conclude mistaken units. The SPARQL query in Table 11 investigates and compares\nunits within a Setpoint and Control.\n310\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4164\nTable 11.

Action 7: Software Artifacts Generation\nThis section tackles the issues exposed in R4 and R6. Therefore, an automatic generation of\nconfiguration files and software artifacts compliant with IEC 61499 is pursued.\nThe achievement of a configuration file from EMS-templates is carried out by M2T transformations.\nHence, the model source is given by EMS-DM and the text target is defined by control engineer\u2019s\npractice. As an example, a MATLAB script that supports the proof-of-concept of CEMS is sought.\nSuch script should expose parameters within a HLUC. Hence, a M2T is implemented by Acceleo\ntemplates, an open source framework for code generation, see Figure 9. That Acceleo template\ninvestigate all HLUCs (i.e., functions) included within an EMS. Afterwards, the parameters (Param)\nassigned to the identified HLUCs are extracted and customized.\n\u0002\n[for (app: Application| asystem.hasApplication -> filter(EMS) ) separator(\u2019\\n\u2019)]\n%[app.eClass().name/] [app.hasName /];\n[for (hluc:HLUC | app.hasHluc ) separator(\u2019\\n\u2019)]\n%HLUC [hluc.hasName/]\n%Parameters of the Hluc:\n%===================================\n[for (var:Param | hluc.hasVariable->filter(ParamHluc) )]\n[app.hasName.concat(\u2019.\u2019).concat(hluc.hasName).concat(\u2019.\u2019).concat(\u2019Param\u2019).concat(\u2019.\u2019).\nconcat(var.hasName).concat(\u2019=\u2019) /][ var.hasVarValue-> filter(Analog).hasAnaValue/];\n[/for] ...\n\u0003 \u0004\nFigure 9. Acceleo template to generate configuration file of HLUCs.\nThe proof-of-concept of CEMS is also supported by generation of MATLAB/simulink models.\nA generation of MATLAB/Simulink applications from EMS-templates is based on M2M transformation\nwhere the PIM is given by EMS-DM and the PSM by a MATLAB/Simulink model. As first step,\na conception of MATLAB/Simulink model should be reached, this model is proposed within the\nMATLAB Simulink Integration Framework for Eclipse (MASSIF) project [44]. The root of that model is\nSimulinkModel, which contains Block and SubSystem. A SubSystem is characterized by properties\nand ports of type Outport and InPort. Those ports may be related to a SingleConnection.\nThis configuration is quite similar to EMS-DM structure. Hence, the concepts: ApplicationEMS\nand UCEMS are transformed into SubSystemSim, InputEMS into InPortSim, InformationFlowEMS into\nSingleConnectionSim and so on, as shown in Table 12. To increase the understanding of classes\ntransformation the syntax classModel is used.\nAn automatic generation of IEC 61499 applications from EMS-templates requires a model\nrepresenting IEC 61499 applications. A UML class representation of it is reached from an analysis\nof the standard IEC 61499 [45], see Figure 10. As it can be noticed the depicted model share many\nsimilarities with the EMS-DM, thus a matching between them is possible as shown in Table 12.\nA UCEMS is mapped to a FB61499, which is defined by a FBType61499. The FBType can take the form of\none single block (BasicFB) or an arrangement of blocks (FBNetwork), see Figure 10. On the other hand,\nApplicationsEMS is converted into Application61499, InputsEMS into InputVarss61499 and so on.\n311\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4164\nModel-to-model transformation across MATLAB/Simulink, IEC 61499 and EMS-DM can be\nimplemented by following the mappings referenced in Table 12. This gives a flexibility to transform\nEMD-DM instances (i.e., EMS-templates) into specific platforms important to the proof-of-concept and\nimplementation phases. Transformation rules are carried out using ATL Transformation Language\n(ATL), a M2M transformation language that implements unidirectional transformations within the\nEclipse platform [46]. To illustrate this, the rules to transform UCEMS into FBType61499 are shown\nin Figure 11.

CEMS Implemented with the Extended EMSOnto\nThis section shows how the above presented improvements of the EMSOnto are used by control\nengineers during the realization of a CEMS.\n5.1. EMS-Templates\nThe previously introduced CEMS is specified using SGAM-TB, which is available as an extension\nof the design tool Sparx Systems EA, thus UML and SysML support the CEMS design. Hence,\nthe structure of the CEMS is specified under UML use case diagrams, the resulting model is depicted\nin Figure 12. From such a representation it is deduced that the CEMS implements Sel f C and FW,\nwhich are associated with a Meter and a BESS. Moreover, Sel f C implements the functions PI_Control\nand Limit_SoC just as FW implements Linar-Control and Limit_SoC. All those details define the CEMS\nstructure and should be considered at the design phase. To support this, an automatic transfer of\ninformation from SGAM models to EMS-templates is executed. This involves UML use case, sequence,\nand activity diagrams. The resulted EMS-template from a use case diagram is shown in Table 13.\nThis represents a first version of the EMS-ABox and the starting point of the design process.\n<<High Level Use Case>> \nSelfC \n<<Primary Use Case>> \nPI_Control \n<<Primary Use Case>> \nLimit_SoC \n<<Logical Actor>> \nMeter \n<<Logical Actor>> \nCEMS \n<<Logical Actor>> \nBESS \n+hasPUC +hasPUC +hasPUC\n+Implement\n+IsRelatedToUC\n+IsRelatedToUC\n<<High Level Use Case>> \nFW \n<<Primary Use Case>> \nLinear-Control \n+Implement\n<<Primary Use Case>> \nLimit_SoC \n+hasPUC\n+IsRelatedToUC\n+IsRelatedToUC\nFigure 12.

UC and IED Repository\nAt the design phase, ICD files provided by the IED\u2019s manufacturer are available to the control\nengineers. Selected ICD files are imported into the UC repository to benefit from IED and UC models.\nA reduced model of an ICD file containing the LN:FWHZ is illustrated in Figure 13. A detail\ndescription of that LN is available in IEC 61850-90-7 [47]. The XML file shows variables within the\nLN:FWHZ, which are represented as DO elements. Attributes of those variables are contained within\nthe DOType identified under ASG_0. Those attributes are of type AnalogogueValue_0 and own values\nof type FLOAT32. With that in mind, it is understood that LN:FWHZ contains the variables Wgra,\nHzStr and HzStop. Each of them owns a series of attributes: setMag, units, minVal and maxVal which\nare of type FLOAT32. The exposed LN:FWHZ is transformed into PUC(FWHZ), afterward this PUC is\nload into the UC & IED repository, thus accessible to control engineers.\nSince the operation followed by the LN:FWHZ is similar to PUC(Linear-Control), it is worth\nsetting the PUC\u2019s type to FWHZ. As a result, all the variables related to LN:FWHZ are imported within\nLinear-Control, see Table 14. However not all the attributes\u2019 values are collected (e.g., min, max, unit),\nthis is because those values are set during real-time operation of IEDs.\n\u0005 \u0002\n<LNodeType lnClass=\"FWHZ\" id=\"FWHZ_0\">\n<DO name=\"Wgra\" type=\"ASG_0\" desc=\"active power gradient in percent of frozen ...\n<DO name=\"HzStr\" type=\"ASG_0\" desc=\"delta frequency between start frequency ...\n<DO name=\"HzStop\" type=\"ASG_0\" desc=\"delta frequency between stop frequency ...\n</LNodeType>\n<DOType cdc=\"ASG\" id=\"ASG_0\" desc=\"Analogue setting\">\n<DA dchg=\"true\" fc=\"SP\" name=\"setMag\" bType=\"Struct\" type=\"AnalogueValue_0\"/>\n<DA dchg=\"true\" fc=\"CF\" name=\"units\" bType=\"Struct\" type=\"Unit_0\"/>\n<DA dchg=\"true\" fc=\"CF\" name=\"minVal\" bType=\"Struct\" type=\"AnalogueValue_0\"/>\n<DA dchg=\"true\" fc=\"CF\" name=\"maxVal\" bType=\"Struct\" type=\"AnalogueValue_0\"/>\n</DOType>\n<DAType id=\"AnalogueValue_0\">\n<BDA name=\"f\" bType=\"FLOAT32\"/>\n</DAType>\n\u0003 \u0004\nFigure 13.

Constraints of the CEMS\nThe inference of CEMS\u2019s constraints entails a collection of technical limitations regarding the\nprocess to be controlled (i.e., DERs, IEDs). This means that IED\u2019s constraints are documented within\nthe extended EMS-templates. Once this process is complete, IED models are upload to the repository\nand CEMS\u2019s constraints are automatically resolved.\nAs an example the BESS\u2019s constraints are inferred. The BESS model is built by control engineers,\nsee Table 15. As it can be noticed, the BESS owns the variables active power (Pbat) and apparent\npower (Sbat). The active power is set by Setpoint(sp_Pre f ). This statement is exemplified by the role\nIsAssignedBy. Moreover, constraints on the BESS are detailed. Hence, C1 represents a constraint on\nPbat and C2 a constraint on Sbat. Since Sbat and Pbat are constrained by Pbat2 + Qbat2 \u2264 Sbat2 the\nrelation IsConsLinkCons(C1, C2) is established. The resulted BESS is upload to the repository. Next,\na reasoner engine is executed, and new knowledge is provided to the control engineers. One of those\n314\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4164\nresults corresponds to PUC(Limit_SoC) being limited by the constraints C1 and C2. This implicit data is\nhighlight with blue color in Table 16. The role IsAssignedTo is the inverse of IsAssignedBy.\nTable 15. Extended BESS model apprised by control engineers\nUC Variable Description Type IsAssignedBy Const. Const.

Inconsistencies Report\nInconsistencies reports are generated from querying the CEMS\u2019s inferred data. The original\nEMSOnto already supports reports of conflicts between UCs [8]. On top of that, the extended EMSOnto\nallows the identification of further inconsistencies such as BESS mismatching a service (II) and\nmisconfigured units (II I). During the design process the report shown in Table 17 was provided to\ncontrol engineers. The report shows II I as an identified mismatch, which led to a correction of the unit\nconfigured within Control(ct_Pre f ), a control signal targeting the setpoint (sp_Pre f ) of the BESS.\nTable 17.

SoC Estimator Function\nSince FW and Sel f C are controlling the BESS they need to estimate how much power was\ndelivered by the BESS. This is reached by instantiating the function SoC_estimator and attaching\nthose instances to HLUC{FW, Sel f C}. EMSOnto provides an automatic creation of PUC(FW_SoC) and\nPUC(Sel f C_SoC) as shown in Table 18. The PUCs are instances of SoC_estimator and therefore share the\nsame attributes (e.g., CAh_UC, I). This new information is highlighted by blue color.\nTable 18. SoC of the functions HLUC {FW, Sel f C} is estimated by adding new PUCs.\nHLUC PUC Description Type Variable Description\nFW FW_SoC state of charge of a HLUC SoC_estimator CAh_UC capacity assigned to a UC\nSelfC SelfC_SoC state of charge of a HLUC SoC_estimator I current charged into the battery\n5.6. Software Artifacts Generation\nAn automatic generation of the MATLAB script shown in Figure 14 is performed. Only the\nparameters\u2019 values are generated. Other attributes such as format and unit are dismissed. Moreover,\na refinement of the code was not necessary and it was used as it was generated. This script supports\nthe proof-of-concept of the CEMS simulated within a MATLAB/Simulink platform [8].\nOn the other hand, the validated CEMS is transformed into IEC 61499 models, the ensemble\nof function blocks focused on HLUC(FW) is shown in Figure 15. A refinement of the obtained model\n315\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4164\nconsisting on the replacement of function blocks is carried out. Furthermore, two clients simulating\nthe communication with real BESS and meters are generated but not configured (BESS and Meter).\n\u0002\n%Application CEMS;\n%HLUC FW\n%Parameters of the Hluc:\n%===================================\nCEMS.FW.Param.Priority=1.0;\nCEMS.FW.Param.CAh=0.3;\nCEMS.FW.Param.SoC=10.0;\nCEMS.FW.Param.BessSize=100.0;\nCEMS.FW.Param.Ena=1.0;\nCEMS.FW.Param.SoCini=1.0;\n\u0003 \u0004\nFigure 14.

Evaluation of Requirements and Open Issues\nThis section exposes how the open issues stated in Section 2.4 are addressed by analyzing the\nimplementation of the selected use case example (CEMS).\nDocuments available at design phase are exploited: The previous experiments regarding the\nCEMS demonstrate an automatic processing of documents intended to support the CEMS design.\nIn other words, knowledge structured under information models (IEC 61850) and specification\napproaches (SGAM) are collected to populate EMS-templates.\nSGAM models provide a high amount of information regarding the specification of an EMS.\nSince the design should implement a solution according to EMS specifications, SGAM models were\nimported within EMS-templates. As a result, at the design phase control engineers starts with\na design totally aligned with the requirements defined by stakeholders. Another benefit of this,\nis that potential manual errors, susceptible to be introduced by manual input of EMS-templates,\nare avoided. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that by model-driven engineering techniques it is\npossible to employ SGAM models in a computerized way to support the whole engineering process.\nThis corresponds to the use of SGAM knowledge for the generation of software artifacts. Nevertheless,\nthe presented experiments did not consider other specification approaches such as Intelligrid and\nUML. Getting information derived from such approaches would imply to carry out a formal data\nrepresentation as well as transformation rules and maybe extensions on the EMS-TBox as it was done\nwith SGAM. The fact of proving an alignment between SGAM and EMSOnto sets the basis for other\npossible alignments.\nAnother executed experiment corresponds to the import of IEC 61850 SCL files into the IED and\nUC repository. IEC 61850 suggests not only power system components but also IED functionality.\nIn that regard, the PUC(Linear-Control) is successfully generated from the LN FWHZ. Only the LN\u2019s\n316\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4164\nattributes required by engineers were covered in the experiments. However, since the EMS-TBox does\nnot contain all the classes and attributes defined within IEC 61850 a full import of the LN\u2019s attributes\nwould involve a further extension of the EMS-TBox.\nThe successful import of SCL files attempts to demonstrate that power utility information models\ncan be used to feed the UC and IED repository. This means that the same mechanisms used to\nimport IEC 61850 models are expected for other models such as energy market communication models\nformalized in IEC 62325 and also smart meter models defined within IEC 62056 among others [48].\nEnlargement of inferred knowledge: Inferences provided by EMSOnto were extended.\nThe inferences performed in this work support control engineers by deducing the constraints to\nbe respected. Besides this, the identification of inconsistencies that may harm the correct operation of\ncontrol applications was carried out. On top of that, new functions (SoC_Estimator) were created to\naccelerate and support the design of control applications.\nSince different sort of inferences were achieved this may lead to think that EMSOnto is flexible to\nimplement any kind of inference. However, this strictly depends on the expressivity provided by the\nontology (SROIQ(D)) and also the rules. Although SROIQ(D) is well defined, the expressivity\nfor rules is determined by rule languages. In this work, SWRL and SPARQL were enough to\naddress the control engineer\u2019s requirements. Nevertheless, other requirements may need to use\nthe Rule Interchange Format (RIF), which provides the means to insert primary logic programming\nlanguages [37], or even to extend ontologies with probabilistic inference and temporal logic [49].\nFlexible generation of software artifacts: CEMS experiments demonstrate that generated\ncode and models support control engineers not only in the proof-of-concept but also during\nthe implementation phase. To make this possible, mappings between a power system emulator\n(MATLAB/Simulink), a controller platform (IEC 61499 platform) and Emsonto are conceived as well\nas text templates for code generation (MATLAB script). This evaluation lays the groundwork for\nimplementations to other specific platforms (IEC 61131-3, PowerFactory).\nThe final realization of control applications requires the participation of engineers for the\ncustomization of generated models as well as the definition of the control algorithm\u2019s behavior.\nIn the use case example, communication interfaces were generated (BESS and Meter clients), although\nnot configured. Consequently, the generation of a full control application ready to be tested is not fully\nautomated. Indeed, other approaches cover those gaps. For instance, PSAL supports the design and\nimplementation of communication and component layers [10]. Therefore, the cooperation between\ndifferent engineering and development approaches is encouraged.\n6. Conclusions\nIn the near future, a high integration of BESS within the distribution grid may very well become\na reality since they can provide a broad range of services. Those services are likely to be deployed\nwithin an EMS which in turn will control the active and reactive power of a BESS. In that context,\nthis work seeks an automated and adaptable approach that would support the engineering process of\nsuch EMS. Therefore, available engineering approaches are studied to realize what are the open issues\nto be addressed. Among the studied approaches, EMSOnto\u2014a holistic approach for multi-functional\nBESS\u2014is selected as the reference methodology.\nThe identified open issues are handled by the EMSOnto expert, whose main role is the\ncustomization of the EMSOnto according to control engineer\u2019s requirements. As a solution, the expert\nproposes a set of actions based on model-driven engineering techniques and ontologies. Those are\nsummarized as the extension of the EMS-TBox, setting up of new rules and queries, extension of\nEMS-templates, and finally the conception of data models and transformation rules. All those actions\nare exemplified by a selected use case example showing the realization of a CEMS, which encapsulates\na series of control engineering requirements. The realization of the CEMS allows to evaluate the\nefficacy and limitations of the proposed solutions. The experiments were tied to specific tools\nand standards (MATLAB/Simulink, IEC 61850, IEC 61499, SGAM) to show the EMSOnto expert\u2019s\n317\nSustainability 2018, 10, 4164\nactions. These experiments set foundations for further customizations of EMSOnto with the aim of\nencompassing other standards and tools. An analysis of the tasks performed by the EMSOnto expert,\nafter collecting and understanding the control engineer\u2019s requirements, is outlined, and discussed:\n1. Define an ontology/data model of the EMS under study\n2. Integrate rules and queries to the ontology\n3. Propose a methodology to gather knowledge from the EMS\n4. Design data models for specific software platforms, IEDs, DERs, etc.\n5. Elaborate transformation rules for code/text and model generation\nFrom the abovementioned steps, only steps 4 and 5 should be carried out to exploit information\nsources available at the specification stage. This is demonstrated by the CEMS example, where\nEMS-templates are fed with SGAM models. Hence, a consistency between specification and design\nphases was reached. Similarly, the abovementioned steps can also be applied to other specification\nand design approaches such as IntelliGrid, PSAL, etc. On the other hand, by following steps 1, 2 and\n3 the inference of implicit knowledge is achieved. It was demonstrated by detecting inconsistencies\nwithin multi-functional BESS (e.g., misconfigured units) and by deducing functions at the design\ntime (e.g., SoC_estimator). The proposed methodology can enable inference within other modern\napproaches (e.g., PSAL) as well. Besides this, a customized generation of software artifacts is achieved\nby performing steps 1, 4 and 5. As a result, EMSOnto is now able to support the implementation stage\nwith generated code aligned to a controller platform (IEC 61499). In the same way, other approaches\ncan also benefit from the referred steps to achieve compatibility with different specific platforms.\nFrom the CEMS use case example, it is worth noticing that limitations of inferences depend\non the expressivity of the ontology (e.g., OWL ontology) and the intelligence provided by rule\nlanguages. Consequently, it is encouraged to choose the right ontology language for the handling\nof the knowledge to be inferred. Moreover, the validation of EMS involves a dynamic process.\nTherefore, the identification of certain inconsistencies at that stage would require the time notion,\nwhich in a future work can be achieved by extending the expressiveness provided by ontologies with\ntemporal logic [50]. On the other hand, with the current approaches, it is common to document the\nplanned design (e.g., PSAL, SGAM, EMSOnto). Modifications to the stipulated design occurs often\nduring proof-of-concept and implementations stages. However, since the modified information is not\ntracked then the generated software artifacts would not be aligned with the final validated design.\nTo handle that issue, reverse engineering along the engineering process is encouraged [51]. Moreover,\nthe validation of multi-functional BESS applications often involves tools such as communication\nnetworks and co-simulation frameworks. This means that the communication and component domains\nshould be considered by the selected approach. However, this is not always the case since the\nmentioned domains are not modeled within EMSOnto. Thereby, as future work it is encouraged to\ncombine different approaches, for instance, combining EMSOnto with PSAL where a formal semantic\nfor communication interfaces and components is addressed.\nAuthor Contributions: C.Z. wrote the paper and carried out the conceptualization, investigation and validation\nof the work.

For this reason,\nvarious incentive schemes improving the economic profitability of energy storage systems are\nunderway in many countries with an aim to expand the participation rate. The electricity charge\ndiscount program, which was introduced in 2015 in Korea, is one of the policies meant to support the\neconomic feasibility of demand-side energy storage systems. This paper quantitatively evaluated the\nimpact of the electricity charge discount program on the economic feasibility of behind-the-meter\nenergy storage systems. In this work, we first summarized how electricity customers can benefit from\nbehind-the-meter energy storage systems. In addition, we represented details of the structure that\nmake up the electricity charge discount program, i.e., how the electricity charge is discounted through\nthe discount scheme. An optimization problem that establishes a charge and discharge schedule\nof an energy storage system to minimize each consumer\u2019s electricity expenditure was defined and\nformulated as well. The case study results indicated that the electricity charge discount program\nhas improved the profitability of behind-the-meter energy storage systems, and this improved\nprofitability led to investment in behind-the-meter energy storage systems in Korea. As a result of the\nelectricity charge discount program, Korea\u2019s domestic demand side energy storage system market\nsize, which was only 27 billion dollars in 2015 in Korea, has grown to 825 billion dollars in 2018.\nKeywords: energy storage system; electricity charge discount program; peak reduction; economic\nfeasibility analysis; policy effectiveness evaluation\n1. Introduction\nIn the 2016 Paris Climate Change Agreement, South Korea committed to a 37% reduction target by\n2030 [1]. In order to achieve this, Korea announced the 3020 Renewable Energy Implementation Plan on\nDecember 2017 [2,3]. The renewable portfolio standard (RPS) was strengthened, while the proportion\nof renewable energy generation was increased, and the aging coal plant shut down plan was begun in\nKorea [2,4]. However, integrating renewable energy resources with the power system can negatively\naffect the power system, due to the inherent intermittency of renewable energy resources and rapid\nvariation of renewable energy generation [4]. Particularly in an isolated power system with relatively\nlow power system inertia, like Korea, the negative impact of intermittent renewable energy resources\nmay have greater leverage [5]. As one of the various solutions to relieve the impact of renewable energy\nSustainability 2019, 11, 186; doi:10.3390/su11010186 www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability322\nSustainability 2019, 11, 186\nresources integration, global leaders\u2014such as the U.S. and Germany\u2014are promoting the expansion\nof energy storage system (ESS) applications [6]. Korea has also been supporting ESS businesses and\ntechnologies. Plans to disseminate 1.7 GW ESS by 2020 through the research and development (R&D)\ninvestment of $5.7 billion and the establishment of institutional incentives were announced in 2010 [7].\nA renewable energy certificate (REC) is given to ESSs that are linked to renewable energy, such as\nwind and photovoltaic power [8]. In the transmission and distribution networks, ESS has provided\nthe primary and secondary frequency regulation service and substitution for upgrade of decrepit\ndistribution network facilities. The ESS supply business is proceeding annually with government\nsubsidies, and electricity charge discount programs are provided for using ESS to reduce consumers\u2019\nelectricity bills.\nESS is a solution to various challenges associated with power systems. ESS applications improve\nthe flexibility and reliability of the power system [9,10]. First of all, ESS does not require external\nexcitation to start. This makes ESS suitable for providing a black start service. Case studies of black\nstart services of ESSs in medium voltage distribution networks are discussed in Manganelli et al. [11].\nFurther, upgrades of transmission and distribution network facilities can be deferred through ESS\ninstallation [12\u201314].\nESS is more useful for providing frequency regulation services than conventional generators due\nto the fast ramping capability of ESS [15,16]. The determination scheme of the optimal cost-effective size\nof ESS to provide a primary frequency reserve has been studied [17,18]. In the New York Independent\nSystem Operator\u2019s market, an ESS is more profitable on load frequency control service than energy\narbitrage on the customer side [19].\nAccording to Moore and Shabani [6], the ESS capacity should be 10 to 20 percent of the total\nintermittent renewable energy generation in order to avoid power system disturbance caused by\nthe integration of renewable energy generation. Mitigating the fluctuation of intermittent renewable\nenergy generation through ESSs has been studied in Zhao et al., Beaudin et al., Barton and Infield and\nSuberu et al. [20\u201323]. The determination of the size and location of ESS installation for integrating\nwind power generation has also been studied in Nguyen and Lee and Dvorkin et al. [24,25]. Nguyen\nand Lee [24] examined a method of dispatching wind power generation while minimizing the size of\nESS connected with wind power and Dvorkin et al. [25] conducted a study for the determination of\nthe size and location of ESS installation so as to maximize profit through energy arbitrage through\nsurplus power from renewable generation variation.\nNumerous studies have been carried out on ESS applications as demand-side energy resources,\nand these have mainly focused on reducing each customer\u2019s electricity expenditure. The charge\nand discharge scheduling of behind-the-meter ESS for a smart home\u2019s electricity bill minimization is\nstudied in Longe et al. [26]. The proposed energy scheduling and distributed storage (ESDS) algorithm\nof Longe et al. [26] aims to reduce electricity bills while increasing customer satisfaction. Studies\non charge and discharge scheduling algorithms further considered the operation and wear-out costs\nof batteries [27,28]. The proposed scheduling schemes are established in consideration of the fact\nthat repetitive charge and discharge of ESS degrade each battery\u2019s lifetime. In Babacan et al. [29],\nthe scheduling algorithm of the behind-the-meter ESS aiming to minimize each customer\u2019s electricity\nexpenditure, as well as mitigate the fluctuation of net demand load with solar photovoltaic generation,\nis proposed and demonstrated. In addition, an optimization scheme for sizing the behind-the-meter\nESS in peak shaving application for a base charge reduction of electricity bills is proposed and\ndemonstrated in Martins et al. [30].\nESS applications on the demand side bring economic benefits to electricity customer first. Further,\nlarge amounts of demand-side ESSs improve public value, such as a power system\u2019s flexibility and\nreliability [31,32]. The increase of ESS capacity on the demand side in the power system provides\ncontrollability of the demand loads that increases the demand-side management capability, resolves\nthe fluctuation of distributed generation and uncertainty of loads, and reduces tangible and intangible\ncosts for power system operation. For these reasons, governments in various countries around the\n323\nSustainability 2019, 11, 186\nworld have implemented policies encouraging the dissemination of ESS [6,33]. These governments\nhave initiated subsidies, released loan support funds, and introduced incentive programs in tax credit\nand electricity tariff systems.\nSubsidies to supplement the low profitability of ESS with high initial investment costs are the\nmost direct way to improve the economic feasibility of ESS. In Germany, one-third of the installation\ncosts for ESS with solar panels are subsidized. In Japan, since the Great East Japan Earthquake, federal\ngovernment and municipal governments have enhanced subsidy programs for the purpose of widely\nspreading household emergency power sources. In California, USA, the Self-Generation Incentive\nProgram (SGIP) offers subsidies for advanced ESSs [33]. In Korea, more than 85 MW, 210 MWh ESSs\nhave been installed through government subsidies of more than $53.6 billion.\nThese governments have also enforced mandatory installation schemes. In California, the major\npower suppliers in the state are obliged to install 1325 MW of ESSs by 2020, and they are currently\nissuing orders to install ESSs, which are equivalent to 1% of the peak time power requirement for\nsmall businesses [33]. This installation obligation will be gradually strengthened from 2.25% of the\nelectricity supply in 2014 to 5% in 2020. In Korea, ESS has been mandatory in the public sector since\n2017. All of the public buildings in Korea with a contract power of 1000 kW or more should install\nan ESS [34]. The capacity of installed ESS should be more than five percent of the building\u2019s contract\npower. ESS has to be preferentially considered as a back-up power source of public buildings when\nback-up power is installed at public buildings. In addition, the states of Oregon and Massachusetts\nhave also enforced mandatory programs for ESS [33].\nFinancial incentives are introduced and initiated in Korea for improving the economic\neffectiveness of behind-the-meter ESSs. Up to a six percent investment tax credit is given to electricity\ncustomers who install an ESS with a high efficiency certification at their own sites. Through the ESS\nelectricity charge discount program (ECDP), electricity customers can earn benefits through not only\nload shifting and peak reduction, but also using the electricity charge discount. Institutional incentive\nand technological advancement in the market environment have improved the economic feasibility of\nESS applications and driven investment in ESS projects.\nThe aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of the Korea\u2019s public policies on enhancing\nthe economic feasibility of behind-the-meter ESS to disseminate ESS to the demand side.\nA behind-the-meter ESS is an ESS placed at the bottom of the receiving end. It is electrically connected\nto the electricity customer, not to the utility. The incentive policy for improving the economic feasibility\nof behind-the-meter ESS leads to the expansion of demand-side customers as a whole.\nThis paper conducts a sensitivity analysis of the behind-the-meter ESS\u2019s economic feasibility\naccording to the ESS ECDP. Since the release of ESS ECDP in 2015, the duration of ESS ECDP has\nbeen extended, and the discount rate has been increased. After 2020, the incentives of ESS ECDP will\nbe gradually decreased and finally expire in 2026. This paper attempts to verify that the ESS ECDP\naffects the profitability of behind-the-meter ESS and that increased profitability through ECDP leads to\nincreased scale of investment in ESS on the demand side.\nESS ECDP is described in Section 2 and the cost-benefit structure of behind-the-meter ESS is\nmodeled and formulated in Section 3. Section 4 quantitatively analyzes the sensitivity of the economic\nfeasibility according to ESS ECDP in stages. Finally, the impact of public policy on demand-side ESS is\nreviewed in Section 5. This paper provides governments with the impact of public policy on the ESS\nas a reference for decision making regarding ESS diffusion.\n2. Energy Storage System (ESS) Electricity Charge Discount Program (ECDP)\n2.1. Benefits of Behind-the-Meter ESS\nThe benefits of ESS on the demand side are generated through the sale of stored power, demand\nresponse, and electricity bill reduction [30]. Since December 2014 in Korea, consumers can sell\nless than 1000 kW of electric power from their behind-the-meter ESSs to the Korea Electric Power\n324\nSustainability 2019, 11, 186\nCorporation (KEPCO). In this case, less than 50% of the total annual stored energy is allowed to be sold\nto the KEPCO, and the settlement of sold power is calculated using the system marginal price (SMP).\nHowever, on average, the SMP has been lower than the electricity usage rate at peak time since 2015 in\nKorea. In addition, following the initiation of ESS ECDP, the self-consumption of stored power in ESS\nat the peak load time can earn discounts on the base charge as well as electricity bill reduction through\npeak reduction and load shifting. Therefore, consumers are more motivated to utilize self-consumption\nthan sell stored power.\nIn the case of the demand response, ESS is not used as a sole resource, as it is used with various\nresources such as light, electric motors, and other facilities. In addition, since the reduced peak\nload by ESS is already reflected in the baseline decision, which is the basis of the demand response\nsettlement calculation, ESS is not useful as a demand response resource. For these reasons, electricity\nbill management is the dominant factor for giving customers benefits through ESS rather than the\ncases of the sale of stored power or demand response.\nIn Korea, a time of use (TOU) rate is applied to electricity customers, excluding households.\nThe TOU rates consist of the base charge, which is charged according to the peak load, and the usage\ncharge, which is charged according to the electricity usage. In the TOU rates system, one\u2019s electricity\nbill can be reduced through peak reduction and load shifting with the ESS charge\u2013discharge scheme.\nThe base charge is saved by discharging the ESS to lower the peak load. The usage charge is reduced\nby load shifting, which means that ESS charge with low-cost electricity at light load time and discharge\nat peak load time then replaces expensive electricity purchases. Consequently, the ESS operator\nwould establish an optimal ESS charge\u2013discharge schedule that maximizes the benefits of the ESS by\ndetermining whether to use the limited ESS resources for peak reduction for base charge savings or for\nload shift in order to reduce usage charge.\n2.2. ESS Electricity Charge Discount Program\nThe ESS ECDP has been implemented in Korea since 2015 to encourage expansion of the\ninstallation of ESS on the demand side. It is designed to establish a structure to give back to ESS\ninvestors according to the contribution of behind-the-meter ESS to the power system such as reduced\npeak demand, increased power system flexibility, and improved load management capability. The ESS\nECDP consists of base charge discount and usage charge discount for ESS charge. If an ESS reduces\nthe peak load through discharging at peak load time, then the base charge of the electricity bill is\ndiscounted by reflecting the peak load reduction. The electricity rate for electricity usage to charge ESS\nat light load time is discounted.\nThe effectiveness of the ESS ECDP depends on the discount period and the discount rate. All of\nthe discounts are available during the discount period, and therefore, upon expiration of the discount\nperiod, a behind-the-meter ESS can only save base charge through peak load reduction and reduce\nusage charge through energy arbitrage, i.e., load shifting. Since it was initiated, the range and\neffectiveness for the ESS ECDP have been strengthened in stages. The ESS ECDP began with a 10%\ndiscount on the electricity usage for charging ESS in 2015, and it was extended to base charge discount\nso as to return the peak reduction contribution of ESS to the ESS owner with base charge reduction\nbenefit in 2016. On 1 January 2017, the Korean government implemented a policy to temporarily\nincrease the discount rate of ECDP for the purpose of enhancing the effectiveness of the incentive\nsystem, and in May, announced a one-year extension of the applicable period of the increased discount\nrate. With the initiation of the increased discount rate of ECDP, a weight to the discount rate depending\non the battery storage capacity has been introduced. This weight is determined by the ratio of ESS\nbattery storage capacity to contract power of the electricity customer. Table 1 summarizes the range\nof ECDP, discount rate, and period in four stages, and these are depicted by year in Figure 1. Table 2\ndescribes the weights according to the ratio of contract power to battery storage capacity.\n325\nSustainability 2019, 11, 186\n \n(a) (b) \nFigure 1. (a) Discount rate of base charge discount. (b) Discount rate of usage charge discount.\nTable 1.

Weight of ESS ECDP.\nBattery Capacity/Contract Power (%) Weight\nMore than 10% 120%\nBetween 5 and 10% 100%\nLess than 5% 80%\nBefore the initiation of ESS ECDP, the benefits of behind-the-meter ESS relied on load shifting and\npeak reduction. These were not enough to attract investors to invest in demand-side ESSs. However,\nthe ESS ECDP significantly increases the profitability of behind-the-meter ESSs.\nFigure 2 illustrates schematically how ESS benefits consumers, i.e., the profit-making structure\nvia peak reduction and load shifting through behind-the-meter ESS. The green line shown in Figure 2a\nis a typical load pattern of the commercial building with a contract power of 3000 kW. A 250 kW,\n1000 kWh ESS is applied to the building in order to reduce electricity bills, and the schedule of charge\nand discharge for this ESS is drawn in green and red bars, respectively. The orange line is a net load\npattern that reflects the ESS charge and discharge on the original load pattern.\nFirst of all, as shown in Figure 2a, the ESS reduces the original peak of 1898 kW to 1715 kW\nthrough discharging at the peak time period. This peak reduction also reduces the base charge of the\nelectricity bill.\nThe electric power charged in the ESS in a light load time period, which is low in its electricity\nusage rate, is used by discharging at a peak load time period, in which an electricity usage rate is\nexpensive. ESS provides benefits as much as the difference in electricity usage charges for these two\ntime periods. A discount for electricity usage to charge ESS improves the profitability of arbitrage\nthrough load shifting.\n326\nSustainability 2019, 11, 186\n \n(a) (b) \nFigure 2. (a) Peak reduction and load shifting through behind-the-meter ESS. (b) Base charge reduction.\nFigure 2b provides information on the benefit generation structure through peak reduction.\nThe base charge of the electricity bill for the original peak, the blue bar, is reduced to the green bar via\nESS discharging at peak time. In addition, ECDP provides additional discounts on the base charge\nby reflecting the contribution of the peak load reduction. The red bar in Figure 2b is the base charge,\nwhich is the final payment of the customer. Compared to the original base charge, the final base charge\nwas reduced by about 50.3%. This is a reduction of about 45.0% additional savings compared to 9.6%,\nwhich is the base charge reduction through the peak load reduction of the ESS without ECDP. Details\nin the improvement of profitability of behind-the-meter ESSs due to ECDP and the resulting expansion\nof ESSs on the demand side are discussed in Section 4.\n3. Problem Definition and Formulation\nThis chapter defines and formulates the cost-benefit structure of a behind-the-meter ESS as well as\nthe optimization problem for electricity bill minimization. In this chapter, in terms of minimizing the\nelectricity bill, the cost is defined as the electricity charge for charging the ESS. In addition, the benefits\nare the base charge and usage charge reduction, and discounts for electricity charge through the ESS\nECDP. The optimization problem, which establishes a schedule of behind-the-meter ESS for minimizing\nelectricity bills, is organized so as to analyze the effectiveness of ESS ECDP on the profitability of\nbehind-the-meter ESSs. Furthermore, the correlation between ESS profitability and diffusion effects is\nderived to assess the extent to which economic improvements in behind-the-meter ESS affected the\nspread of demand-side ESSs.\n3.1. Base Charge Reduction\nThe base charge for electricity is charged monthly, depending on the peak load, in kW, regardless\nof electricity usage, in kWh. It is calculated as the product of the annual peak load and the unit base\nrate. If the annual peak load is under 30% of the contract power, the base charge is calculated based on\n30% of the contract power. As a short peak power occurring in summer or winter becomes the basis\nfor the base rate calculation of the following year, thorough peak load management is required.\nWith the ESS, the base charge can be lowered by simultaneously discharging at the time when the\npeak load occurs. When the load exceeds a predetermined level, the ESS starts to discharge and the\nload no longer increases. However, due to the storage capacity limit of ESSs, it is important to set an\nappropriate level of the peak load control value by considering the forecasted load.\n327\nSustainability 2019, 11, 186\nMeanwhile, peak reduction through a ESS not only leads to savings in the base charge, but also\nhas the effect of improving the customer\u2019s load factor, which is defined in Equation (1). A higher load\nfactor, i.e., thorough peak management, improves the customer\u2019s economic feasibility [35].\nLoad f actor, LF = \u2211\nt=(Tl+Tm+Tp)\nPlt \u00d7\n1\nPlTmax\n(\nTl + Tm + Tp\n)\n(1)\nThe base charge savings through peak reduction are represented as follows:\n\u03c0b =\n(\nPlTmax + P\nc\nTmax \u2212 PdTmax\n)\n\u03bcb (2)\nThe effectiveness of the base charge reduction through ESS differs depending on each electricity\ncustomer\u2019s load factor. Due to the limited storage capacity of the ESS, the base charge reduction\nthrough peak load reduction can be better for electricity customers with a low load factor than those\nwith a high load factor.\n3.2. Usage Charge Reduction\nThe usage charge reduction stems from load shifting, a type of arbitrage transaction. This is to\nreduce the electricity bill based on the difference between the two rates by charging the ESS at the\nlight load time with a low electricity rate and discharging the ESS at the peak load time with a high\nelectricity rate. The usage charge reduction through load shifting is formulated in Equation (3):\n\u03c0u = \u03bcl \u2211\nd=D\n\u239b\n\u239d \u2211\nt=Tl\n(\nPcd,t \u2212 Pdd,t\n)\n+ \u03bcm \u2211\nt=Tm\n(\nPcd,t \u2212 Pdd,t\n)\n+ \u03bcp \u2211\nt=Tp\n(\nPcd,t \u2212 Pdd,t\n)\u239e\u23a0 (3)\n3.3. Elecricity Charge Discount\nESS ECDP is applied in two ways, as described above, with a discount on the base charge and\nusage rate for charging the ESS. The base charge discount is calculated by multiplying the electricity\nbase rate and peak load reduction as in Equation (4). The peak load reduction is predetermined by the\nelectricity company, KEPCO, in Korea as in Equation (5). Discounts on usage charges are granted only\nfor electricity usage to charge ESS at light load times. The discount for usage charge is represented as\nEquation (6).\n\u03c0bd = \u03a6\u03bc\nb\u03b4b\u03c9 (4)\n\u03a6 =\n\u2211d=D \u2211t=Tp\n(\nPdd,t \u2212 Pcd,t\n)\n3\n(5)\n\u03c0ud = \u03bc\nl\u03b4c\u03c9 \u2211\nd=D\n\u2211\nt=Tl\n(\nPcd,t\n)\n(6)\n3.4. Electricity Bill Minimization\nThe purpose of behind-the-meter ESSs is to minimize electricity bills, which can be achieved by\nmaximizing benefits through ESSs. Since ESS has a capacity limit, the ESS operator should resolve\nthe optimization problem of allocating limited stored energy considering all the benefit-making\noptions: peak reduction, arbitrage, and ECDP. The problem of electricity bill minimization through\n328\nSustainability 2019, 11, 186\nbehind-the-meter ESS is defined as Equation (7). Then, the decision variables of the cost minimization\nproblem are the kW powers of ESS charging and discharging.\nmin.C =\n(\nPlTmax +P\nc\nTmax \u2212 PdTmax\n)\n\u03bcb\n+ \u2211\nd=D\n(\n\u03bcl \u2211\nt=Tl\n(Pcd,t(1 \u2212 \u03b4c\u03c9)\u2212 Pdd,t + Pld,t) + \u03bcm \u2211\nt=Tm\n(Pcd,t \u2212 Pdd,t + Pld,t)\n+\u03bcp \u2211\nt=Tp\n(Pcd,t \u2212 Pdd,t + Pld,t)\n)\n\u2212 13 \u03bcb\u03b4b\u03c9 \u2211\nd=Dw\n\u2211\nt=Tp\n(Pdd,t \u2212 Pcd,t)\n(7)\nsubject to\n0 \u2264 Pc \u2264 Pcmax\n0 \u2264 Pd \u2264 Pdmax\nPdmax = P\nc\nmax\n(1 \u2212 \u03b5)E \u2264\nT\n\u2211\nt=1\n(\nPct \u2212 Pdt\n)\n\u2264 \u03b5E, \u2200t\nTn\n\u2211\nt=Tn\u22121\nPdt \u2264\nTn\u22121\n\u2211\nt=1\n(\nPct \u2212 Pdt\n)\n, \u2200t\n3.5. Economic Feasibility Evaluation\nThe effectiveness of the ESS ECDP on the profitability of behind-the-meter ESS is analyzed\nthrough economic feasibility evaluation in this paper. In order to evaluate the economic feasibility\nof behind-the-meter ESS, the cost and profit of behind-the-meter ESS are defined and represented\nas follows:\ncost:\nC = \u2211\nd=D\n\u2211\nt=T\n(\n\u03bctPcd,t\n)\n\u2212 \u03c0ud = \u2211\nd=D\n\u239b\n\u239d\u03bcl(1 \u2212 \u03b4c\u03c9) \u2211\nt=Tl\nPcd,t + \u03bc\nm \u2211\nt=Tm\nPcd,t + \u03bc\np \u2211\nt=Tp\nPcd,t\n\u239e\n\u23a0 (8)\nand profit:\n\u03c0 =\n(\nPlTmax + P\nc\nTmax \u2212 PdTmax\n)\n\u03bcb + \u2211\nd=D\n(\n\u03bcl \u2211\nt=Tl\nPdd,t + \u03bc\nm \u2211\nt=Tm\nPdd,t + \u03bc\np \u2211\nt=Tp\nPdd,t\n)\n+ 13 \u03bc\nb\u03b4b\u03c9 \u2211\nd=Dw\n\u2211\nt=Tp\n(\nPdd,t \u2212 Pcd,t\n) (9)\n3.6. Correlation Coefficient\nThe correlation between the economic feasibility of behind-the-meter ESS and the installation\ncapacity of ESS on the demand side is analyzed in order to verify the effectiveness of the ESS ECDP,\nwhich is a public policy aiming to expand ESS diffusion. The closer the relationship of economic\nfeasibility of ESS and installed capacity of demand-side ESS, the closer the correlation coefficient is to 1.\nA positive correlation coefficient means positive correlation and a negative correlation coefficient means\ninverse correlation. The correlation coefficient between the economic feasibility of behind-the-meter\nESS and the dissemination of demand side ESS is carried out in this work.\n329\nSustainability 2019, 11, 186\n4. Case Studies\nIn this section, the impact of the ESS ECDP on the improvement of the economic feasibility\nof the behind-the-meter ESS is quantitatively analyzed. Furthermore, the way in which this\neconomic improvement led to actual ESS dissemination on the demand side is evaluated. All the\nsimulations and calculations in this paper are conducted with MATLAB 7.10.0 (R2010) of MathWorks\nin Natick, Massachusetts, U.S.A. Also, all the figures provided in this paper are also drawn through\nsame program.\n4.1. Load Analysis and ESS Scheduling\nA complex center with 2500 kW of contract power was selected as a sample for the evaluation of\neconomic feasibility. Figure 3 shows the 24-h load patterns and its distribution for each hour of the\nactual load of the building for a year. In winter, the load pattern is different from the other seasons\nbecause of the different peak time period applied to electricity charge and heating demand in the\nevening and at night. Therefore, the loads are analyzed separately for spring, summer, autumn,\nand winter. The peak load usually occurs as the flow of outside visitors increases around lunch and\ndinner time. Due to the characteristics of this building, which has many night shifts, the load at all\ntimes is kept above a certain level, except for in the early morning hours. This building is subject to the\nelectricity tariff, A-level high voltage with option II, as summarized in Tables 3 and 4.\n \n(a) (b) \n \n(c) (d) \nFigure 3.

ESS Scheduling\nAn overview of the behind-the-meter ESS in this work is given in Table 5. Excluding\npumped-storage hydro power plants and uninterruptible power supplies, more than 99% of ESSs\nin Korea are lithium-ion battery ESS. In addition, in order to meet the High-efficiency Appliance\nCertification criteria for ESS in Korea, the ESS should have a round-trip efficiency of over 89%. Given\nthe service characteristics of ESS applications, behind-the-meter ESS for peak reduction and load\nshifting is suitable to have a storage time of about two to five hours [36]. A 250 kW, 1000 kWh ESS\ncapable of sustaining the rated power for four hours is considered for this study.\nTable 5. Specification of ESS and Conditions of Analysis.\nBattery type Lithium-ion\nRated power 250 kW\nStorage capacity 1000 kWh\nRound-trip efficiency 89%\nLife cycles 3000 cycles (\u224812 years)\nDepth of discharge (DOD) 95%\nMaintenance cost 0.2% of capital cost, annually\nThe optimization problem for the ESS charge\u2013discharge scheduling was solved, and the results\nare shown in Figure 4. Since the base charge saving and base charge discount through peak reduction\nare more profitable than arbitrage through load shifting, the ESS is mainly discharged at the peak time\nperiod. In addition, since the maximum load occurring at the light load time is not considered in the\ncalculation of the base charge, the ESS charged from midnight to its rated power without considering\nany additional calculations for charging. If the ESS charge is made at a light load time, there is no\nvariation in the economics of how and when it is charged. Thus, it is more effective for the operator to\nset the charging schedule in consideration of the operating aspect and the life cycle of the ESS.\n331\nSustainability 2019, 11, 186\n \n(a) (b) \nFigure 4. (a) ESS charge-discharge schedule in spring, summer, and fall; (b) and in winter.\n4.3. Economic Feasibility of ESS without Subsidies or Fixed Cost\nSince the initiation of the ESS ECDP in Korea, discounts are strengthened in stages. In this work,\nthe economic feasibility of ESS ECDP of each stage is analyzed.\nThe cases for analysis are summarized in Table 6. Case 1 is the case without discount before the\nESS ECDP initiation. Cases 2 to 5 are cases of ESS ECDP in stages, as shown Table 1 after ESS ECDP\ninitiation. Cases 4 and 5 reflect a temporarily raised discount rate for base charge discount. In Cases 4\nand 5, a discount rate of 300% is initially applied, and then a discount rate of 100% is applied after the\nend of the 300% discount period.\nTable 6. Controlled Cases for ESS\u2019s Economic Feasibility Analysis.\nDiscounts Case I Case II Case III Case IV Case V\nBase charge discount - - 100% 300%, 100% 300%, 100%\nPeriod of base charge discount (years) - - 10 3, 7 4, 6\nUsage charge discount for the ESS charge - 10% 10% 50% 50%\nPeriod of usage charge discount (years) - 3 3 3 4\nIn this study, the impact of the improved profitability of behind-the-meter ESS through the ESS\nECDP on the dissemination of demand side ESSs in Korea is analyzed. Subsidies that have been\nprovided to behind-the-meter ESSs should be considered so as to analyze the correlation of economic\nfeasibility with the dissemination of ESS in real cases. In order to consider the cash discount rate in\nthe case study, the discount rate is assumed to be 3%. In this work, the capital cost of ESS is fixed\nat $625,000.\nIn order to assess only the effect of the ESS ECDP, controlled cases without other considerations,\nsuch as cost degradation and governmental subsidy, were analyzed. Economic feasibility evaluation is\nconducted in terms of payback period, benefit-cost ratio, internal rate of return (IRR), and net present\nvalue (NPV). The results are carried out in Table 7. Cases 1, 2, and 3 did not achieve payback during\nthe lifetime of the ESS. Thus, in these cases, the ESS project is not profitable. In Cases 4 and 5, ECDP\u2019s\nincentives ensure that the ESS project is economically viable.\nTable 7.

Economic Feasibility of ESS in Real Cases\nRegarding the real cases, subsidies and price decrease are considered. The value of subsidies for\nbehind-the-meter ESS is given as 80% of the total cost of ESS installation since 2012, and it is decreased\nby year. The real cases in this work including subsidies are summarized in Table 8. Further, details in\nthe price decrease of ESS in the domestic market in Korea are shown as Figure 5. In this work, the actual\neffect of the market environment and public policy including the ESS ECDP on economic feasibility are\nevaluated. The results are shown in Tables 9 and 10. Table 9 represents the results of analysis of ESS\neconomic feasibility in private markets excluding government subsidies for ESS private investment\nand ESS economics comparison. Table 10, on the other hand, shows the economic feasibility evaluation\nresults of ESS considering government subsidies.\n \n(a) (b) \nFigure 5. (a) Total cost of behind-the-meter ESS installation. (b) Cost of power conditioning system\n(PCS) and battery storage of ESS.\nAccording to Table 9, which is the result of the ESS economic feasibility evaluation in the private\nmarket excluding government subsidies, ESS is worth the investment only in Cases 4 and 5 that\nwere implemented the ESS ECDP with a 300% base charge discount and 50% usage charge discount.\nUntil then, a behind-the-meter ESS is not profitable.\nIn Table 10, even though ECDP was introduced in Case 2, the economic feasibility of Case 2 is\nlower than that of Case 1. This is because the government subsidy rate for behind-the-meter ESS\ndecreased from 70% to 50% in Case 2. It can be concluded that the economic feasibility of the ESS\nproject is more dependent on subsidies than institutional incentives before the incentive programs are\nfully implemented. In Case 3, compared to Case 2, the subsidy rate was maintained, and the effect of\nimproving the economic efficiency was significantly increased by introducing the base charge discount.\nIn Case 4 and 5 of real case studies, the profitability of a behind-the-meter ESS drastically increased\nregardless of whether government subsidies were given or not. Therefore, it can be inferred that private\ncapital investment in behind-the-meter ESS would have been influenced. In other words, it is analyzed\nin Section 4.5 whether improved economic feasibility leads to the diffusion of demand-side ESSs.\nTable 8.

The dark red one labeled \u201cPrivate Investment\u201d is the amount of ESS installed for consumer\u2019s\neconomic profit, such as electricity bill management, and a government subsidy is not given here.\nFinally, the correlation coefficient of IRR and ESS investment is shown in Table 11.\n \n(a) (b) \nFigure 6. Korea\u2019s annual domestic ESS market size by source of investment in (a) MW, and (b) MWh.\nTable 11.

Discussion\nBased on the actual case of installing 250 kW and 1000 kWh ESS at the contract power of a\n2500 kW complex center, we examined whether the ESS ECDP, the incentive policy for the expansion\nof the demand side ESS, acted as intended by the Korean government. As shown in Table 7, an ESS\u2019s\neconomic feasibility is improved as the discount rate is raised and the discount period is extended.\nAccording to the results of case studies shown in Table 9, without government subsidies, incentives of a\n300% base rate discount and 50% charge rate discount should be given for positive profitability. On the\nother hand, Case 1 of Table 10, which receives 70% of government subsidies, is profitable because it can\nsave a considerable amount of investment cost without the incentive. However, this is not constrained\nby the limited government budget, and therefore cannot lead to continued ESS market expansion.\nConsidering that it usually takes less than a year of 1 MWh-sized behind-the-meter ESS installation\nprocesses, the improved profitability of behind-the-meter ESS due to the ESS ECDP enhancement\nis immediately connected to the demand side ESS dissemination of the following year. As shown\nin Figure 6, the amount of ESS installation on the demand side has increased noticeably from 2017,\nwhere in Case 4, the incentive of the ESS ECDP was strengthened and the behind-the-meter ESS had\npositive profitability. The extension of the ESS ECDP in May 2017 further improved the economic\nefficiency of behind-the-meter ESSs, as in Case 5, resulting in the explosion of demand-side ESSs\nin 2018.\nWe can see in Figure 6 that the private sector investment contributed more to the growth of the\nKorean domestic demand side ESS market than any other sectors. We can also infer from this study\nthat it is effective to build a market structure that can secure return on investment in order to form the\ndemand side ESS market as a private led market.\nAs a result, the ESS ECDP for improving the economic feasibility of behind-the-meter ESSs in\norder to diffuse the ESS on the demand side in Korea has directly attracted investment in demand-side\nESSs. The ESS ECDP initiated in 2015 to promote private sector investment in the behind-the-meter\nESS has resulted in the growth of Korea\u2019s demand-side ESS market, which was only $27 billion in 2015,\nto $825 billion in 2018. In addition, after the advanced ESS ECDP initiation in 2017, which provides an\nIRR of at least 5% as in Case 4 of Table 9, the private sector ESS investment, which had not existed\nbefore 2015, had risen to $105 billion in 2017 and $783 billion in 2018. These were about 54% and\n95% of the total market, respectively. These results suggest that it is possible to promote the private\ninvestment on the domestic demand side ESS with public policy on behind-the-meter ESS.\n6. Conclusions\nThis paper shows that public policy to support the profitability of behind-the-meter ESS in Korea\ndrives increased installation in demand-side ESSs. In order to clarify this, we first described the\nESS ECDP, the representative public policy to enhance the profitability of behind-the-meter ESSs in\nKorea. In addition, we defined the cost\u2013benefit structure of demand side ESS and formulated the cost\nminimization problem for electricity bill reduction. Finally, we clarified how ESS ESCP affects the\nprofitability of a behind-the-meter ESS and how the improvement of profitability of a behind-the-meter\nESS influences increased investment in behind-the-meter ESSs. Since the Korean government has\ncontinued subsidies and incentives to support the profitability of behind-the-meter ESSs, investment\nin demand-side ESSs has increased in Korea. In particular, the investment has led by the private sector\nand amounted to $783 billion, about 95% of the total domestic demand side ESS market for the seven\nmonths from January to July 2018.\nThe results of this paper can be used as reference for policymaking in countries considering\nESS diffusion through institutional effort to expand renewable energy supply. When the countries\nintending to promote the spread of ESS diffusion through public policy determined the level of\nincentive degree in view of the targeted amount of ESS installation, the results represented in this\npaper can be referenced.\n335\nSustainability 2019, 11, 186\nPrevious studies aiming to maximize the economic efficiency of ESS resources on the demand side\nhave mainly focused on the optimization of the charging\u2013discharging schedule of ESSs in combination\nwith other distributed resources such as photovoltaic generation and electric vehicles. However,\nthis paper quantitatively evaluates the impact of policy decision-making on the economic performance\nof a behind-the-meter ESS, thereby broadening the approach to the study of the demand-side ESSs.\nFurthermore, studies on the effects of public policy promoting ESS applications on the supply side,\nsuch as renewable portfolio standards (RPS), can be considered in further study.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, B.-K.J. and G.J.; Methodology, B.-K.J.; Software, B.-K.J.; Validation,\nB.-K.J., S.J. and G.J.; Formal Analysis, B.-K.J.; Investigation, B.-K.J.; Resources, B.-K.J.; Data Curation, B.-K.J.;\nWriting\u2014Original Draft Preparation, B.-K.J.; Writing\u2014Review and Editing, S.J. and G.J.; Visualization, B.-K.J.;\nSupervision, G.J.; Project Administration, S.J. and G.J.; Funding Acquisition, S.J.\nFunding: This work was supported by Korea Electric Power Corporation Grant (R18XA06-40), and National\nResearch Foundation Grant (No. 2018R1C1B5030524) funded by the Korean government.\nConflicts of Interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest.\nNomenclature\nPld,t Load power on day d at time t in kW\nPdd,t Discharging power of ESS on day d at time t in kW\nPcd,t Charging power of ESS on day d at time t in kW\nE Storage capacity of the ESS in KWh\n\u03c0b Base charge savings through peak load reduction in US dollars\n\u03c0u Usage charge savings through load shifting in US dollars\n\u03c0bd Base charge discount amount in US dollars\n\u03bcb Unit rate for base charge of electricity bill in US dollars per kW\n\u03bcp Unit rate for electricity usage at peak load time period in US dollars per kWh\n\u03bcm Unit rate for electricity usage at medium load time period in US dollars per kWh\n\u03bcl Unit rate for electricity usage at light load time period in US dollars per kWh\nD Days of the month\nDw Weekdays of the month\nY Life years of the ESS\nTp Peak load time period\nTm Medium load time period\nTl Light load time period\nTmax The time of peak load occurrence\n\u03c9 Weight of discount rate\n\u03b4b Base charge discount rate\n\u03b4u Usage charge discount rate for ESS charging\n\u03b5 Depth of discharge of battery storage of the ESS\nReferences\n1.

IntroductionMuch has been written about the new role consumers can play in future smart grid (SG). Drivenby the massive integration of renewable energy resources, the SG is evolving swiftly, causing changesin how electricity is produced, managed, marketed, and consumed. If for a while, the SG paradigmmeant merely accepting a bi-directional flow of electricity and information, it must continue to evolveto adapt to the current demands of the digital consumer. In the years to come, the computationalexploitation of the enormous amounts of information provided by the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors,incorporated at all layers of the SG, will become the main engine of its evolution towards the digitalenergy network, focused on customer service. This is what has been called \u201cdata-driven energy\u201d [1].A large amount of energy data will support collective decision making, opening the way to moreresponsive utilities and more engaged consumers. This will undoubtedly impact the evolution ofhousehold appliances. In fact, SAs are already showing their potential for data-driven energy [2].The growing use of energy by domestic appliances shows no signs of slowing, reaching 2900 TWhin 2017. The use of electricity by these loads continues to grow by almost 2% per year, a steady trendEnergies 2019, 12, 3336; doi:10.3390/en12173336 www.mdpi.com/journal/energiesEnergies 2019, 12, 3336 2 of 16since 2010 [3]. Although the electricity demand for major appliances has slightly decreased since 2007,mainly due to improvements in their energy efficiency, the rapid proliferation of small appliances andbrown goods has absorbed these savings. The energy consumption due to these small loads has growntwice as fast as that of large appliances in the last decade. In addition, only one-third of domesticappliances consumption is under regulatory protection, particularly in emerging markets. This maybecome even more relevant in the near future as the demand for electricity in buildings increasesdue to the impact of the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. While it is true that there is aneed to increase the rigor of existing policies by extending regulatory coverage to a broader range ofdevices, on the other hand, user awareness may be the key factor. However, to achieve this, consumersshould be rewarded to some extent when changing their behavior. The availability of information andcommunication technologies (ICT) on SG can be decisive in meeting this commitment through thewidespread adoption of DR strategies.In other areas, such as power electronics, it is common to find a complete chain of modeling,development, testing, optimization, virtual validation, and rapid prototyping commercial tools thatintegrate seamlessly into a convenient testing and development environment such as these tools ofTyphoon (Typhon, Somerville, USA) [4] and dSPACE (dSPACE, Paderborn, Germany) [5]. It is possibleto find testbed proposals for different applications in SG, like our previous one [6]. In the newlyreleased paper [7], a distributed framework for real-time management and co-simulation of DR in SG ispresented. This solution provides a near real-time co-simulation platform to validate new DR-policiesexploiting IoT approach performing software-in-the-loop. In the recent papers, authors propose aninteresting testbed for distributed DR based on a microgrid (MG) modeled on the PSIM software(Powersim, Rockville, USA) to provide frequency regulation [8] and control over other grid parametersin general [9]. In the model, the nodes of virtual IoT devices are created according to the collectivecharacteristics of their real twins, connected to the system. Network conditions can be reproducedwhen testing new DR algorithms to provide, e.g., frequency regulation reserve services.Similarly, in order to support the field of DLC research in this emerging application area of SA,it is necessary to provide new testbeds for lab experimentation. Therefore, the main contribution ofthis work is the development of a research test bench flexible enough to incorporate different tools ofdifferent origins such as weather forecasting APIs, DR providers from the utility and mathematicaloptimization features built on the basis of the LabVIEW systems (2015, National Instruments, Austin,USA) design platform and development environment for a visual programming language. It can benefitfrom user-friendly and intuitive software as well as hardware such as powerful real-time processors,user-programmable field-programmable gate array (FPGA), and full I/O interfaces. However, althoughit also offers libraries of dedicated functions, it has been necessary to specifically develop a sophisticatedsoftware (that did not exist) that supports the seamless link between the tools, since their individualparts are precisely aligned with each other. In this sense, the proposed testbed is a novelty since mostof the papers available in the literature are focused on the development of complex mathematicalmodels without considering the integration of these tools that are so important to implement a realisticplatform and thus emulate scenarios and test cases as real as possible. Furthermore, this work is a stepforward from previous research, as it includes several tools that have never been integrated before.The organization of the paper as follows. Sections 2 and 3 presents the background of the research.Then, Section 4 describes the experimental platform and also examines the control and optimizationstrategies, considering practical limitations and safety constraints in detail. In Section 5, the case studyis discussed. Finally, the conclusions and future work are reported in Section 6.2. Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) State of the ArtThe combination of the SG paradigm with IoT technologies and the will of consumers to activelyparticipate in their energy control has enhanced the HEMS concept. These are systems capable ofmonitoring home consumption at different levels and implementing automation or control mechanisms.Energies 2019, 12, 3336 3 of 16They have evolved at an unstoppable pace in the last years. By 2013, most systems only offeredhome monitoring, either local or remote and rarely some manual control over switches or dimmableloads [10].Currently, on the contrary, a wide variety of control systems are available ranging from thesimple automatic scheduling of applications to the optimization of energy resources, through advancedalgorithms that consider the state of numerous external variables such as energy prices or weatherconditions. What is more, they are even able to learn from users thanks to the incorporation of artificialintelligence [11].Because of this evolution and the large range of devices and algorithms that are being integratedinto the HEMS, the number of works in the literature is extensive and unapproachable for a paperwhose purpose is not that. However, for example, the authors in [12] define a classification accordingto the level of complexity of these systems. This will help to situate the present work and the challengesaddressed. The levels from the lowest to the highest complexity are Monitoring, Logging, Alarm,Energy Management, and DR.Nowadays, the first three levels can be regarded as a prerequisite. Every HEMS must carry outhome monitoring at different aggregation levels. The basic level is the total household consumption,generally measured by technologies such as Smart Meters, widely deployed across Europe [13].Nevertheless, the energy footprint of individual elements can be recorded by means of load submeteringor non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) algorithms, which use machine learning to distinguishindividual appliances from the total consumption [14].The capture of measures can be performed with different granularity and be stored in differentsupports. In this way, all or part of the data is stored in the cloud, from where it is possible to obtaindescriptors or apply machine learning algorithms. This also allows for the possibility of generatingalarms at different levels, so fast events that require immediate attention can be generated and thenprocessed in the so-called Edge, while more complex alarm mechanisms can be implemented in higherlayers after preprocessing and analysis of historical data.The aforementioned elements are essential for the creation of reliable controls at the next levelsnamed: energy management and DR. The first focuses on the control of a combination of distributedresources to guarantee a continuous power supply, whereas the second goes a step further and managesthe individual consumer appliances.Among the recent publications, the most used optimization techniques are mixed-integerlinear-programming [15], and variation of those [16], as well as population-based algorithms [17]. It isalso common to find works that propose multi-objective algorithms to reach a trade-off between theenergy savings that can be achieved and the benefits from possible incentives [18].Nevertheless, as is evident from the most recent publications, the use of Internet technologies asa solution to optimization problems is becoming more and more common [19], as they tackle issuessuch as the diversity of household appliances, the simultaneous pursuit of several objectives in parallel,and the uncertainty in predicting conditions such as occupancy levels, energy consumption or weatherconditions [20].3. Smart Appliances OverviewWhat is a SA? There is more than one definition, but popularly a SA is recognized because it hassome degree of embedded processing and wireless connectivity. Sometimes called a Net appliance,an Internet appliance or an information appliance, it can be as simple as an application that warnsyou whenever your refrigerator has a door opened, or as complex as remotely controlling your ovenfrom your smartphone or via a voice assistant. However, in the framework of the SG, the term \u201csmart\u201dfocuses on those systems (with communications-enabled) which are able to modulate their electricityconsumption in response to external signals such as price information [21], local measurements [22]or direct control commands [23]. In other words, those appliances that can support grid flexibilitybecause they have been configured to respond to DR requests.Energies 2019, 12, 3336 4 of 16In a recent survey [24], 28% of people find SA very attractive, but people are more reluctant tobuy them because of price concerns, so 49% of people say this is a barrier to buying. Other barriersinclude dynamic pricing, lack of interoperability and legal framework as reported by the Europeanparliament [25] and the world economic forum [26]. First, the lack of a dynamic pricing model tothe clear majority of customers is an obstacle. Users will not be willing to change their habits ifthey cannot perceive that this intelligent functionality can bring them substantial financial savings.Second, the high purchase premiums and long replacement cycles of these devices are prolonging theirmass adoption. Thirdly, to enable the communication between SAs that use different protocols andstandards, and to ensure interoperability, the communication interface must be supported by a datamodel that conforms to a harmonized reference ontology. A semantic platform called OpenFridge hasrecently been proposed in [27] that has been deployed and evaluated with real-life users distributedglobally. But the candidate for such a reference ontology will almost certainly be the Smart AppliancesREFerence ontology (SAREF) [28]. SAREF4ENER [29] is the SAREF extension to be able to fully supportDR for the energy domain.Finally, the lack of a clear legal structure around customer data limits growth in this area.This could include the appliance energy use pattern meaning when, how much and how is energybeing consumed. These data could even be monetized. For example, appliance manufacturers might bewilling to pay an energy supplier a fee for these data, as they can be of great value in terms of customerservice, product support, as well as maintenance. In the case of aggregation [30], how this data couldbe shared among customers to allow, e.g., for their energy efficiency comparison. An aggregator canoperate on behalf of a group of consumers, having access to data and possible remote adjustment overconsumers\u2019 appliances. If the security of connected devices used in aggregation is not safeguarded,consumers could be exposed to several risks like data theft or request of appliance ransomware.Security flaws and data privacy issues are main concerns of the users, and only a few regions havewell-defined rules about who can access, own, and share utility customer data.However, the prospects for SA are bright. The global market for SA is projected to reach $38.35billion by 2020, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.6% over the projected period2015\u20132020. IoT-enabled devices (currently low, about 5% of white goods) are expected to growdramatically, and the number of sensors is expected to increase six-fold by 2020. So, according to theInternational Energy Agency, by 2040 almost 1 billion households and 11 billion SA could participatein interconnected electricity systems.Typically, DR policies can be classified between load-shifting strategies, which move the loadfrom on-peak or event hours when demand and rates are the highest, to off-peak hours whenrates are lower, and load-shedding strategies, which directly reduce or avoid energy use duringon-peak hours altogether. Consequently, in the residential sector, the loads can be divided intonon-shiftable, time-shiftable and energy \u201csheddable\u201d. The time-shiftable loads are the applianceswhose operation can be moved from peak to off-peak times with the minimal loss of comfort for theinhabitant. This is the category of \u2018wet\u2019 appliances, e.g., dishwashers (DW), washing machines (WM),and tumble dryers (TD). These appliances account for a significant proportion of household energyconsumption. Alternatively, non-shiftable loads, such as lighting and brown appliances, cannot delaytheir operation [31]. At present, there is no deployed infrastructure that allows remote activation ofthese appliances. However, their behavior has been deeply studied and it is now possible to understandthe potential of the DR in supporting the operation of the network [32].Among household appliances, a special category is the thermostatically-controlled loads (TCL)(e.g., electric water heaters (EWH), HVAC systems, refrigerators, and freezers) as their thermal inertiaallows for flexible load patterns (both shifting and shedding) while meeting their service requirement.Therefore, compared to other SA, TCL exhibit predictable behavior from the DR point of view, andeven more when aggregated in large population clusters [33]. In recent work, a stochastic model hasbeen presented for the generation of high temporal resolution synthetic profiles of the consumption ofthese domestic appliances [34]. However, its potential for flexibility remains virtually unknown. [35]Energies 2019, 12, 3336 5 of 16presents the recent projects that are facilitating the transition from research to development. In generalterms, and due to their inherent characteristics, there are two types of TCL, with different operatingprinciples. First, resistive loads (i.e., heat generation equipment) and, second, compressor-drivenloads (i.e., heat pumping equipment). Although this paper is particularly dealing with resistive loads,greater demand elasticities could be achieved if the control strategy achieved were extended to the restof the residential TCL.4. Structure of the Smart Appliance Control TestbedThe proposed control platform is composed of four main blocks that collect data and exchangeinformation between each other aiming to implement the abovementioned DR policies through DLC.The platform architecture is shown in Figure 1, where LabVIEW works as the core application byhandling the data provided by the outer blocks. This central block also has the highest priority from thecall handling point of view, that is, LabVIEW follows the classical scheme where the main applicationdeals with the so-called subVI to allow modular designs. At the same time, this subVIs will be theinterfaces with the rest of the blocks.The block on the right side is related to the API that provides the testbed with both weatherinformation (Ambient temperature and photovoltaic (PV) production forecast) and the price ofthe energy.Finally, these DR policies must be mathematically translated into an optimization model whichincludes several constraints related to the people\u2019s habits, the availability of energy from differentsources and the household appliances features among others. The model should also offer a certaindegree of flexibility with respect to the number of invokes and formulation changes. All these reasonshave contributed to opt for General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS) as the software used to solvethe proposed model. Furthermore, another component including the functions given by the GAMSAPI is used to integrate this software into LabVIEW using a dynamic link library (DLL). The followingsections will describe these previous blocks and their interactions in more detail.Energies 2019, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW  5 of 16  with resistive loads, greater demand elasticities could be achieved if the control strategy achieved 197 were extended to the rest of the residential TCL. 198 4.

Linking GAMS and LabVIEWThis section describes the communication between GAMS and LabVIEW. Some papers showthe integration of GAMS into Matlab [39] or other software like LabVIEW through Matlab as anintermediary interface [40]. In this sense, the novelty of this work is the direct coupling of both toolswithout using any intermediate software. On the one hand, the inner communication between theGAMS model and its GAMS Data Exchange (GDX) file has been included under the subsection GAMSas appears in Figure 1. This file is often used to store the parameters with which the model is called,as well as the model results, however, such interaction does not take place directly but will have to behandled by means of the appropriated classes and methods that the GAMS object-oriented API [41]provides resulting in the seamless integration of GAMS into any application such as LabVIEW in thiscase. This architecture employs the C++ API in a DLL format which is the interface that makes thelinkage possible. The flowchart is shown in Figure 3. First, system and working directories have beenset; the system directory refers the path where all GAMS installation files are located while the workingdirectory refers to the path where the GAMS models and GDX files will be stored (also shown in part Bof Figure 2). The second stage aims to create a database object where the parameters used in the modelwill be stored, but this will be carried out in the third stage. The model execution options, such asthe names of the database object and the exchange file to be used are subsequently specified. The laststages are in charge of executing the model, returning the optimal values of the decision variables.Energies 2019, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW  7 of 16  4. .

Dynamic-link library (DLL) flowchart for linking both environments. 281 4.3. An Optimization Model for Demand-Side Management 282 While most of the proposed models address this issue as a task scheduling problem using 283 heuristics algorithm to make decisions on shifting, shedding or even disconnecting the load, this 284 paper proposes a novel mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that uses the price-based 285 DR programs to optimize the power consumption using the potential flexibility that TCL provides to 286 the demand. The proposed model involves a smart home with its own ESS, distributed energy 287 resources (DER) based on PV panels as well as a scenario with SA managed through the DLC 288 strategy. 289 In terms of mathematical formulation, Equation (1) refers to the objective function \ud835\udc53 (in \u20ac) 290 where \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc61) (in kW, as all the powers henceforth) and \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc61) (in \u20ac/kWh) are the power consumption 291 from the grid and the price of the energy respectively at time slot \ud835\udc61 \u2208 [1,2, \u2026 \ud835\udc47]. The rest of the 292 equations are constraints related to the power balance, the user preferences and the energy 293 availability from the sources. Equation (2) denotes the global power balance at each time slot \ud835\udc61 with 294 \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc61), the power taken from the PV panels \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc63(\ud835\udc61) as well as the power given by the energy storage 295 system \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60(\ud835\udc61) on the generation side. On the demand side is the non-shiftable power \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60(\ud835\udc61), which 296 involves the stand-by consumption coming from non-dimmable devices, such as lighting, low power 297 DC adapters used to supply small devices and also the consumption from the SA scheduled in fixed 298 Figure 3. Dyna ic-link library (DLL) flo chart for linking both envir e ts.4.3. An Optimization Model for Demand-Side ManagementWhile most of the proposed models address this issue as a task scheduling problem using heuristicsalgorithm to make decisions on shifting, shedding or even disconnecting the load, this paper proposesa novel mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that uses the price-based DR programs tooptimize the power consumption using the potential flexibility that TCL provides to the demand.The proposed model involves a smart home with its own ESS, distributed energy resources (DER)based on PV panels as well as a scenario with SA managed through the DLC strategy.In terms of mathematical formulation, Equation (1) refers to the objective function f (in \u20ac) wherePg(t) (in kW, as all the powers henceforth) and Pr(t) (in \u20ac/kWh) are the power consumption fromthe grid and the price of the energy respectively at time slot t \u2208 [1, 2, . . .T]. The rest of the equationsare constraints related to the power balance, the user preferences and the energy availability fromthe sources. Equation (2) denotes the global power balance at each time slot t with Pg(t), the powertaken from the PV panels Ppv(t) as well as the power given by the energy storage system Pess(t) on theEnergies 2019, 12, 3336 8 of 16generation side. On the demand side is the non-shiftable power Pns(t), which involves the stand-byconsumption coming from non-dimmable devices, such as lighting, low power DC adapters used tosupply small devices and also the consumption from the SA scheduled in fixed mode, Ps(t) is thepower consumption of the common-use SA such as the WM, DW and TD scheduled in variable modeand the consumption of the EWH expressed as the product of its nominal power Pwh and the binaryvariable xwh(t) that indicates its state each time slot.Equations (3)\u2013(5) set the limits for Pg(t), Ppv(t) and Pess(t) respectively, where Pmaxg denotes themaximum power that can be taken from the grid and Pmaxess the maximum power that can be injectedinto or extracted from the ESS. Moreover, the ratio of change of this variable has also been constrainedin Equation (8) through the parameter dPmaxess (in kW/h) in order to ensure a lifetime of the batteries aslong as possible. Finally, fpv(Ppkpv, \u03b7pv,\u03b1,\u03bb,\u03c6, t)refers to the function that implements solcast to providethe PV production each time slot t and thus has been taken as the maximum power available to beinjected into the system from the PV panels. Parameters such as the installed peak power Ppkpv, theefficiency \u03b7pv, the tilt angle \u03b1 or the location, through the latitude \u03bb and longitude \u03c6 will be requiredby this API in each HTTP request.Equations (6) and (7) describe the dynamic of the ESS by means of a simple kWh counter tocompute the current state of charge SoC(t) (in %) based on the previous one SoC(t\u2212 1) and Pess(t) andsetting the SoC(t) limits between SoCmin and SoCmax not to allow deep charges and discharges which isalso a condition to ensure a long lifetime of the system.The SA scheduling process using the variable mode is modeled by Equations (9) and (10) andhas been conceived as a decision-maker who chooses the optimal SA operation from among thepossible ones that could be generated between the selected start and end times, by shifting the originalconsumption one-time slot. In this context, let us define j as the index that refers to each SA to bescheduled and k j the index associated with each shifted consumption that may be generated for eachj, being N j the number of SA and Njk the number of possible consumption profiles. This family ofshifted consumptions builds each matrix \u0393 j(k j, t)which has as many rows as possible scenarios and asmany columns as considered time slots T. Moreover, for the decision-making process, all the shiftedconsumptions have been associated with a binary variable x j(k j)and thus, the optimal scenario will beindicated once the model is solved by means of the state of these decision variables. Finally, to ensurejust one shifted consumption operates, Equation (9) forces the sum so that just one binary variable isequal to 1.The EWH has been considered as a special SA due to its thermal inertia and therefore has its ownpower balance equation as it is apparent from (11). From left to right, this balance involves the energystored inside the EWH tank characterized by the current and previous average water temperatureTwh(t) and Twh(t\u2212 1) (in \u25e6C, as the rest of temperatures hereafter), the tank capacity Cwh (in m3) andthe parameters that model essential features of the supply water like its density \u03c1 (in kg/m3) and itsspecific heat Cp (in kJ/kg\u00b7\u25e6C). The following terms are the thermal losses taking place in the tank wallsgiven by the loss factor gwh (in kW/\u25e6C) and the ambient temperature profile Tamb(t) besides the energyprovided by the water entering the tank as a consequence of the usage events and defined by meansof the hot water consumption Dwh(t) (in m3/s) and the temperature of this water, Tinlet. Finally, thediscrete energy due to the heater element can be found. Once the EWH dynamic has been well-defined,the model for this appliance is fully completed with Equation (12) where the upper and lower limit ofTwh(t) are constrained according to the normal operation temperatures Tminwh and Tmaxwh .Min f =24TT\u2211t=1Pg(t)Pr(t) (1)S.t:Pg(t) + Ppv(t) + Pess(t) = Pns(t) + Ps(t) + xwh(t)Pnwh (2)Energies 2019, 12, 3336 9 of 160 \u2264 Pg(t) \u2264 Pmaxg (3)0 \u2264 Ppv(t) \u2264 fpv(Ppkpv, \u03b7pv,\u03bb,\u03c6, t)(4)\u2212 Pmaxess \u2264 Pess(t) \u2264 Pmaxess (5)SoC(t) = SoC(t\u2212 1) \u2212 100(24T)Pess(t)Cess(6)SoCmin \u2264 SoC(t) \u2264 SoCmax (7)\u2212 dPmaxess \u2264Pess(t) \u2212 Pess(t\u2212 1)24T\u2264 dPmaxess (8)Ps(t) =N j\u2211j=1N jk\u2211k j=1x j(k j)\u0393 j(k j, t)(9)N jk\u2211k j=1x j(k j)= 1 (10)Cwh\u03c1CpTwh(t)\u2212Twh(t\u22121)86400T=gwh[Tamb(t) \u2212 Twh(t\u2212 1)]+Dwh(t)\u03c1Cp[Tinlet \u2212 Twh(t\u2212 1)] + xwh(t)Pnwh(11)Tminwh \u2264 Twh(t) \u2264 Tmaxwh (12)5. Case StudyThis section aims to evidence the effectiveness of the above-described DLC platform by testingit under cases which consist of minimizing the cost of the energy imported from the grid over a24-h time horizon, as was stated in the previous section, with a time resolution of 5 min, so that,T = 288. Concretely, two case studies based on the available electricity tariffs in the Spanish market areconsidered. One case is based on time discrimination in two periods (off-peak and peak) also knownas tariff DHA, and another is a case using the default tariff or tariff A (without time discrimination).Both cases use the SA consumption models shown in Figure 4 and based on 120 min workingcycle divided into 8 slots of 15 min provided by [42].Energies 2019, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW  9 of 16  0 \u2264 \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc63(\ud835\udc61) \u2264 \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc63(\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc58, \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc63, \ud835\udf06, \ud835\udf19, \ud835\udc61) (4) \u2212\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 \u2264 \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60(\ud835\udc61) \u2264 \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 (5) \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc36(\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc36(\ud835\udc61 \u2212 1) \u2212 100 (24\ud835\udc47)\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60(\ud835\udc61)\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60 (6) \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b \u2264 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc50(\ud835\udc61) \u2264 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 (7) \u2212\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 \u2264\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60(\ud835\udc61) \u2212 \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60(\ud835\udc61 \u2212 1)24\ud835\udc47\u2044\u2264 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 (8) \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc60(\ud835\udc61) = \u2211 \u2211 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57(\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc57)\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc57=1\ud835\udee4\ud835\udc57(\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc57, \ud835\udc61)\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57=1 (9) \u2211 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57(\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc57)\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc57=1= 1 (10) \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc64\u210e\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc64\u210e(\ud835\udc61) \u2212 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc64\u210e(\ud835\udc61 \u2212 1)86400\ud835\udc47\u2044= \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc64\u210e[\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4f(\ud835\udc61) \u2212 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc64\u210e(\ud835\udc61 \u2212 1)] +\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc64\u210e(\ud835\udc61)\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5d[\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61 \u2212 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc64\u210e(\ud835\udc61 \u2212 1)] + \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc64\u210e(\ud835\udc61)\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc64\u210e (11) \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc64\u210e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b \u2264 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc64\u210e(\ud835\udc61) \u2264 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc64\u210e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 (12) 5. Case Study 340 This section aims to evidence the effectiveness of the above-described DLC platform by testing 341 it under cases which consist of minimizing the cost of the energy imported from the grid over a 24-342 hour time horizon, as was stated in the previous section, with a time resolution of 5 minutes, so that, 343 \ud835\udc47 = 288. Concretely, two case studies based on the available electricity tariffs in the Spanish market 344 are considered. One case is based on time discrimination in two periods (off-peak and peak) also 345 known as tariff DHA, and another is a case using the default tariff or tariff A (without time 346 discrimination). 347 Both cases use the SA consumption models shown in Figure 4 and based on 120 minutes working 348 cycle divided into 8 slots of 15 minutes provided by [42]. 349  350 Figure 4. Smart appliances (SA) models employed in the optimization: a) Washing machine demand, 351 b) dishwasher demand, and c) tumble drier demand. 352 Figure 4. Smart ap liances (SA) models e l i ti ization: (a) Washing machine demand,(b) dishwasher demand, and (c) t ble drier demand.Additionally, to give the case study a more realistic approach, the component of the non-shiftablepower that represents the standby consumption was obtained by acquiring the active power in one ofthe laboratory circuits for a 24-h workday.Energies 2019, 12, 3336 10 of 16Under this framework, a typical dwelling including a small scale ESS and PV installation has beenchosen as the topology of this case study. More in detail, the PV system is modeled by a nominal powerof 2 kW, an efficiency of 90% and mounted with a tilt angle of 30\u25e6. With respect to the location, southernSpain has been considered for both cases, concretely at 37.88\u25e6 and \u22124.79\u25e6 of latitude and longituderespectively. On the other hand, the ESS has a capacity of 6 kWh, a maximum charge/discharge powerof 2 kW with a ratio of change limited to 0.5 kW/h and where the SoC can fluctuate in the range 35\u201365%,the initial SoC was fixed to 50%. The EWH considered is the type which can be found in the residentialenvironment, vertically mounted and cylindrical, with a capacity of 0.1 m3 as well as a nominal powerof 2 kW. Its loss factor has been set to 2\u00b710\u22123 kW/\u25e6C and the inlet water temperature to 21 \u25e6C [43],while the water temperature inside the tank has been constrained in the range 60\u201385 \u25e6C with an initialcondition of 65 \u25e6C. In addition, an example of hot water consumption considering the water drawnfrom the EWH tank due to household use such as hand washing, showering, and dishwashing amongothers and based on [44] has been used. Finally, the capacity of the main grid has been fixed to 4.6 kWsince it is a common value in Spain. Table 1 summarizes the main parameters of the model as well asits values.Table 1.

Particularly, in this case, the scheduling configuration for theSA has been set as follows: Washing machine scheduled from 09:00 to 14:00, tumble dryer scheduledfrom 16:00 to 21:00 and dishwasher fixed at 14:00.Note from Figure 5a the result of the scheduling process and the times at which the SA start theiroperation cycles. As it is apparent from Psa(t), which is the decoupled consumption of all the SAscheduled in either fixed or variable mode, the washing machine starts almost at midday (at 11:45),around the peak of the prices although a large amount of this demand is covered by the PV system.The dishwasher at 14:00 (as was stated) and tumble drier is shifted until 18:00 where the second valleyof the price can be found. This behavior shows a clear strategy of searching for the lowest price or thehighest PV production to launch these SA. In view of the results, all the initial constraints related to thescheduling period are clearly satisfied.The non-shiftable consumption is denoted by the red line of the same figure including the fixedconsumption of the dishwasher at 14:00 and the experimentally measured example in which the periodof highest activity falls in the range 09:00\u201318:00 according to the laboratory timetables. The green lineshows the power injected into the system from the PV panels, which represents 9.78 kWh, and has notthe same value that the PV production shown in orange (10.65 kWh) and provided by solcast. In thiscase, the system does not use all the energy to achieve the most economical way, however, the amountof this one taken from the main grid is greater than if the PV energy were fully employed.Energies 2019, 12, 3336 11 of 16Figure 5b depicts the EWH behavior using the above-mentioned hot water demand (expressed inL/h instead of m3/s for easier comprehension) and the hourly temperature profile provided by darksky (see purple and blue lines respectively). The EWH consumption shown in orange evolves in therange 0\u20132 kW due to it\u2019s on/off operation. Before 12:00, the water temperature is more or less constantand the power consumption behaves in agreement to the water consumption so that a water demandvariation causes a proportional energy consumption, which means this energy is mainly used to warmthe inlet water. In fact, the highest energy consumption in this interval takes place at the peak of waterdemand. On the contrary, at midday, the water consumption is not significative and thus, this energyis intended to increase the water temperature inside the tank from 60 \u25e6C to 83 \u25e6C, considering multiplefavorable conditions such as the greater availability of energy coming from the PV system, the highambient temperature as well as the amount of charge already stored in the ESS. This temperatureincrement enables to face the future water drawn acts, which is a desirable strategy in response to DRevents as it is the presence of high market prices in this interval. Later, the temperature slowly falls upto 60 \u25e6C at 20:00 due to the water consumption and remains constant the rest of the day.Energies 2019, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW  11 of 16  however, the amount of this one taken from the main grid is greater than if the PV energy were fully 390 employed. 391 Figure 5b depicts the EWH behavior using the above-mentioned hot ater de   392 in L/h instead of m3/s for easier comprehension) and the ho  erature profile provided by dark 393 sky (see purple and blue lines respectively).   consumption shown in orange volves in the 394 range 0\u20132 kW due to it's on/off operation. ef re 12:00, the water temperature is more or less constant 395 and the power consumption behaves in agree ent to the ater consumption so that a water demand 396 variation causes a proportional energy consumption, which means this energy is mainly used to 397 warm the inlet water. In fact, the highest energy consumption in this interval takes place at the peak 398 of water demand. On the contrary, at midday, the water consumption is not significative and thus, 399 this energy is intended to increase the water temperature inside the tank from 60 \u2103  to 83 \u2103 , 400 considering multiple favorable conditions such as the greater availability of energy coming from the 401 PV system, the high ambient temperature as well as the amount of charge already stored in the ESS. 402 This temperature increment enables to face the future water drawn acts, which is a desirable strategy 403 in response to DR events as it is the presence of high market prices in this interval. Later, the 404 temperature slowly falls up to 60 \u2103 at 20:00 due to the water consumption and remains constant the 405 rest of the day. 406  407 Figure 5.

Afterward, the off-peak of the prices can be found 415 Figure 5. Optimization results using tariff A: (a) Power injected by the photovoltaic (PV) system,SA consumption, non-shiftable consumption, and PV production, (b) EWH performance: Consumption,ambient and water temperature as well as hot water demand, (c) energy storage system (ESS)performance: Power and state of charge (SoC), and (d) total consumption from the utility andenergy prices.The ESS shows a clear policy based on the energy price (red line in Figure 5d) and PV production.The initial SoC was set to 50% and quickly decreases to supply the non-shiftable power until 02:00reaching almost 39% in a high-priced environment. Afterward, the off-peak of the prices can be foundand Pess(t) go up as fast as possible (due to the slope of Pess(t) matches to dPmaxess ) to retrieve somecharge previously lost, which is equivalent to shift the amount of energy that belongs to Pns(t), fromEnergies 2019, 12, 3336 12 of 16the beginning of the day to the off-peak interval. During this interval Pns(t) is supplied by means ofthe main grid. At 04:30 the SoC drops again to repeat the same process with Pns(t) and reaches theminimum value allowed (35%) at 08:00. Once here, the PV system begins to inject power that goesdirectly to the ESS resulting in a charging process that carries the SoC from 35% to 65% to address theSA consumption with the help of Ppv(t) during the most expensive interval (12:00\u201315:00). The restof time follows the same principle as explained above: Charge process in presence of the secondoff-peak of the price (15:00\u201317:30) and subsequent discharge to supply both the tumble drier and thenon-shiftable power (17:30\u201300:00). The total energy exported and imported by the system was 3.89 and3.00 kWh respectively. Another important detail is the effect of dPmaxess over Pg(t): Previous tests weredone with a more relaxed value prove that a larger amount of the EWH energy can be absorbed by ESSas this would enable better tracking of demands with higher ratios of change. Finally, in Figure 5dthe hourly prices and the main grid consumption can be found. The foregoing description of thiscase is also reflected in Pg(t) and makes it possible the main objective of avoiding and capitalizing thepeak and off-peak of Pr(t) respectively. The daily price for this case was 1.80 \u20ac with a total demand ofenergy that almost achieves 16.10 kWh.For the following case, the configuration for the SA has been set as follows: Washing machine fixedat 10:00, tumble dryer scheduled from 12:00 to 20:00 and dishwasher scheduled from 14:00 to 19:00.Figure 6a (blue line) shows how the model has decided to launch the dishwasher and tumble drierat the lower limit of the scheduling period which allows the system benefits from the PV production(depicted in orange and kept constant from the previous case) and the ESS that also supplies part ofthis consumption, especially after 13:00, where the prices are much higher than in the previous half.The washing machine operates at 10:00 as expected. The PV production is not fully intended to beinjected into the system (just 9.96 of 10.65 kWh) as is evidenced by Ppv(t), in green, and which also tookplace in the case above. With respect to the non-shiftable demand, the previous part corresponding tothe stand-by consumption has been used, including the demand of the washing machine at 10:00.Both the ESS and EWH have similar behaviors with respect to the previous case but with someexceptions. Figure 6b shows the performance of the EWH under the same assumptions as of thefirst case (water demand, ambient temperature, water temperature limits, and initial conditions)although the temperature increment begins one hour earlier and is more progressive. Furthermore, thetemperature rises at one of the peaks of the water demand while the water was warmed up beforethis maximum in the first case. The ESS also performs similar, which evidences the PV productionhas a higher weight in its behavior than the energy price. Moreover, with respect to Pr(t), it is moreimportant the shape of the function, concretely the maxima and minima location, than the absolutevalues. The energy exported and imported in this case reaches 3.45 and 2.55 kWh. Finally, Figure 6dintroduces the prices, that splits the day in two well-defined half, and the consumption from the maingrid where the most consumption is located in the cheapest region as desired and entails an amountof 15.75 kWh (11.8 kWh from 23:00 to 13:00 compared to 3.95 kWh the rest of time). The daily pricewas 1.30 \u20ac.Once these previous cases have been presented, Table 2 summarizes the results. Obviously, case 2achieves a better performance with respect to the objective function and thus, tariff DHA enables tomore efficient utilization of elements such as DER and ESS in presence of thermal loads that contributeto the flexibility of the system as in this case the EWH.Energies 2019, 12, 3336 13 of 16Energies 2019, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW  12 of 16  and \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60(\ud835\udc61) go up as fast as possible (due to the slope of \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60(\ud835\udc61) matches to \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65) to retrieve some 416 charge previously lost, which is equivalent to shift the amount of energy that belongs to \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60(\ud835\udc61), from 417 the beginning of the day to the off-peak interval.

The 422 rest of time follows the same principle as explained above: Charge process in presence of the second 423 off-peak of the price (15:00\u201317:30) and subsequent discharge to supply both the tumble drier and the 424 non-shiftable power (17:30\u201300:00). The total energy exported and imported by the system was 3.89 425 and 3.00 kWh respectively. Another important detail is the effect of \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65 over \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc61): Previous tests 426 were done with a more relaxed value prove that a larger amount of the EWH energy can be absorbed 427 by ESS as this would enable better tracking of demands with higher ratios of change. Finally, in Figure 428 5d the hourly prices and the main grid consumption can be found. The foregoing description of this 429 case is also reflected in \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc61) and makes it possible the main objective of avoiding and capitalizing 430 the peak and off-peak of \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f(\ud835\udc61) respectively. The daily price for this case was 1.80 \u20ac with a total 431 demand of energy that almost achieves 16.10 kWh. 432 For the following case, the configuration for the SA has been set as follows: Washing machine 433 fix d at 10:00, tumble dryer scheduled from 12:00 to 20:00 and dishwasher scheduled from 14:00 t  434 19:00. 435  436 Figure 6.

Conclusions and Future WorkIn the current context of increasing energy use in the residential environment, where mostconsumption comes from the SA use, the employment of DR policies is essential to deal with this typeof loads through a DLC paradigm with the goal of reaching higher efficient management of the energyresources. This paper has proposed an original architecture that supports research and development,and integrates tools that are very diverse and complementary aiming to develop a platform thatbrings together the best features of all of them, such as the high mathematical performance of GAMS,the accuracy of the weather forecasting applications as well as the flexibility of LabVIEW as the linkingtool. Later both cases studies have been carried out to prove the high capabilities of the testbed withsuccessful results, placing the adopted solution as an attractive alternative towards a higher energyperformance dwelling ambient.Energies 2019, 12, 3336 14 of 16Finally, as future work, the authors leave the real-time control of the DER, ESS, and loads in theprimary and secondary control of a real MG. In this context, the developed platform would perform asa day-ahead demand scheduler in the tertiary control although additional communication channelswould need to be deployed to enable the interface with the lower hierarchical level. Furthermore, themathematical model written in GAMS and thus the developed DLL would also have to be adapted tothe MG needs, however, due to the reconfigurable nature of the system, this would not take more thana few minutes. Hence, this platform could be migrated to be used in a real microgrid expecting thesame performance, but these considerations must be considered.Author Contributions: C.D.M.-M and E.J.P.-G made a comprehensive review of the existing literature.

Distributed energy resources (i.e. rooftop solar photovoltaic, battery storage, electric vehicles, and demand response), communication infrastructures, and smart measurement devices provide the opportunity for electric utility customers to play an active role in power system operation and even benefit financially from this opportunity. However, new operational challenges have been introduced due to the intrinsic characteristics of DERs such as intermittency of renewable resources, distributed nature of these resources, variety of DERs technologies and human-in-the-loop effect. Demand response (DR) is one of DERs and is highly influenced by human-in-the-loop effect. A data-driven based analysis is implemented to analyze and reveal the customers price responsiveness, and human-in-the-loop effect. The results confirm the critical impact of demographic characteristics of customers on their interaction with smart grid and their quality of service (QoS). The proposed framework is also applicable to other types of DERs. A chance-constraint based second-order-cone programming AC optimal power flow (SOCP-ACOPF) is utilized to dispatch DERs in distribution grid with knowing customers price responsiveness and energy output distribution. The simulation shows that the reliability of distribution gird can be improved by using chance-constraint.Dissertation/ThesisMasters Thesis Electrical Engineering 201",

How-\never, new operational challenges have been introduced due to the intrinsic charac-\nteristics of DERs such as intermittency of renewable resources, distributed nature\nof these resources, variety of DERs technologies and human-in-the-loop effect. De-\nmand response (DR) is one of DERs and is highly influenced by human-in-the-loop\neffect. A data-driven based analysis is implemented to analyze and reveal the cus-\ntomers price responsiveness, and human-in-the-loop effect. The results confirm\nthe critical impact of demographic characteristics of customers on their interaction\nwith smart grid and their quality of service (QoS). The proposed framework is\nalso applicable to other types of DERs. A chance-constraint based second-order-\ncone programming AC optimal power flow (SOCP-ACOPF) is utilized to dispatch\nDERs in distribution grid with knowing customers price responsiveness and en-\nergy output distribution. The simulation shows that the reliability of distribution\ngird can be improved by using chance-constraint.\ni\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nMy deepest gratitude goes first and foremost to my supervisor, Dr.

1\nINTRODUCTION\n1.1 Background\nWith the increasing penetration of DERs in distribution systems, more and\nmore customers are transitioning from the role of mere consumers into \u201cprosumers\u201d\n(producers and consumers, in one). However, this active involvement of con-\nsumers along with the ever-increasing penetration level of DERs also causes new\nchallenges in power systems. These challenges are mainly caused due to the es-\nsential nature of DERs, namely, increased uncertainty and variability, which makes\nscheduling of DERs a sophisticated task [1] [2]. Successful transition from the con-\nventional power system to this new paradigm requires an accurate planning and\nefficient management of these ressources.\nAdvanced measurement devices, which are enriched with communication tech-\nnologies such as Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) provides a high vol-\nume of reliable data such as daily household consumption data [3]. This infor-\nmation, along with other data such as weather forecast and social composition\nof customers, enables leveraging data analytical methods to enhance smart grid\noperation. These data-driven based analyses can be leveraged to estimate the par-\nticipation of prosumers in grid services and assess their quality of service (QoS).\n1\nThe ratio of peak electric load to average load is generally increasing [4]. The\nincreasing peak load results in problems standing by more fast generators needed\nto prepare for the huge demand in a very short period of time. Starting more gener-\nators will not only cost a lot, but also be polluted since these generators operate in\nan inefficient manner. In order to handle the peak load condition issue, utilities are\nseeking approaches to improve capacity utilization. Instead of adapting generators\nto match the big change of the load demand, the demand itself can be more flexible\nto follow the requirement on the operation of the smart grid [5]. Demand response\n(DR) is one method that utilities use to shift peak customer\u2019s load and improve the\noperation of the smart grid. It has existed within a utility\u2019s arsenal as a means to\nmanage the power system for decades. For one type of the DR programs, utility\nprovides incentives and benefits to customers so that customers can reduce their\nload during on-peak periods and shift it to off-peak periods. The most common\nDR pricing structure adopted by utilities is the time of use (TOU), which is defined\nas different electricity price for different period of the day [6]. Currently, more and\nmore residential household customers are participating in TOU DR programs in\nthe distribution system. However, with the increasing number of the customers\nparticipating in DR programs, this brings system operational issues into the dis-\ntribution grid since the customers\u2019 consumption behavior becomes different in a\nday due to the difference in the energy prices in distinct periods of the day. Florida\nPower and Light\u2019s (FPL) tested a DR program focused on two-way communication\n2\nbased programmable thermostats where FPL could control the thermostat but that\ncould also be overridden by the customer. The ex-post analysis by FPL showed\nthat customers who enrolled in the program had increased consumption of 12 per-\ncent compared with both earlier usage and that of non-enrollees [7]. This issue\npoints to a fundamental need to consider prosumers\u2019 interactions with the electric\ngrids and the uncertainty of their responses.\n1.2 Social Impact on Power System\nRecent research from social science fields has revealed that energy is not merely\na technological and economic phenomenon, but is rather deeply embedded within\nsocial and geopolitical landscapes [8] [9] [10]. For example, a general daily sched-\nule of the customers, their social composition, and other demographic information\nmay affect their QoS and participation in DR programs. Different DR programs\nhave existed within a utility\u2019s arsenal as a means to manage the power system for\nyears. One key hurdle that, to this day, has not been overcome is the human-in-\nthe-loop challenge. The societal dependency of such method and lack of adequate\nincentives to unleash this potential, the societal desire to participate, are main rea-\nsons DR programs are underutilized. As a result, to fulfill the vision of the smart\ngrid on a sustainable scale, socially-aware engineering solutions are needed.\n3\n1.3 Methodology and Data\nThis thesis aims to apply and extend concepts of the social value of energy to\ndesign a methodology to better operate DERs in distribution gird. This thesis ex-\nplores this multifaceted problem in two stages. The first stage leverages advanced\nmachine learning algorithms and available social and historical consumption data\nto evaluate customers\u2019 price responsiveness and consumption behavior during\nboth the on-peak and off-peak periods. Various machine learning algorithms are\nexamined and compared in order to find the most suitable approach. Artificial\nneural network (ANN) has a very strong ability to fit highly nonlinear functions\n[11]. K-nearest Neighbors (KNN), which is a nonparametric algorithm, requires\na decent data structure. Kernel ridge regression (KRR) is a powerful regression\nalgorithm that can have pretty good performance in terms of the linear function.\nThe second stage shows the advantages of using the proposed method of the first\nstage via a chance-constraint based AC optimal power flow (ACOPF) scheduling\ntool. This model considers both technical and economic constraints in the distri-\nbution grid. There are various methods for implementing chance-constraint in the\nACOPF problem including scenario approach, sample average approximation, ro-\nbust optimization based method. In this thesis, a Monte Carlo Simulation based\nmethod is used to apply chance-constraint in the ACOPF model accounting for the\nuncertainty and variability nature of DERs.\nIn this thesis, firstly customers are classified based on customers\u2019 demographic\n4\ninformation. Papers show that groups of individuals with similar demographic\ncharacteristics exhibit similar behavior towards electric energy [12] [13]. In order\nto accurately estimate and evaluate the participation of prosumers in the smart\ngrid, some papers already addressed demographic data in their work as a boost-\ning strategy [12] [13]. Reference [12] utilizes demographic data from Mosaic, which\nis Experian\u2019s system for geodemographic classification of households, and divides\ncustomers into three subsets in order to improve the accuracy of the model. Refer-\nence [13] uses demographic data as indicators showing the similarity of customers\u2019\nbehavior. Secondly, several machine learning (ML) algorithms are leveraged to\nobtain each group\u2019s baseload during on-peak periods. The customers\u2019 baseload\nis defined as the answer to the question of \u201cHow much they would consume if\nthey do not participate in DR\u201d. In [4], the authors apply a demographic data-\nbased decision tree method and k-mean to cluster the customers, and then they\npropose three baseline calculation approaches which are regression-based, similar\nday-based and morning adjustment. One consumption baseline load prediction\nmethod focuses on finding the control group, which is defined as a group of se-\nlected customers whose daily consumption will be treated as a baseline for other\n[14]. Reference [15] studies the impact of less accurate customers\u2019 consumption\nbaseline load on customers and utility benefits. Reference [16] [17] [18] [19] ap-\nply deep neural network to predict the customers\u2019 consumption without any price\nprogram involved. In this thesis, three regression-based ML algorithms are ap-\n5\nplied to attain customers\u2019 baseload using the consumption data points in off-peak\nperiods. Thirdly, we calculate the consumption reductions and evaluate the cus-\ntomers\u2019 responsiveness from the same category to different DR programs. Finally,\nchance-constraint based SOCP-ACOPF is used to improve the reliability of the dis-\ntribution grid by searching for the best proportion of DERs.\nIn order to show the effectiveness of the proposed data-driven strategy, elec-\ntricity consumption, generation, weather, and demographic data of prosumers in\na local electric utility in Phoenix area are used. Four different datasets from the\nlocal utility including different TOU plans are utilized in this thesis.\n1.4 Literature Review\nLoad forecasting is an important research area in the power system. A pre-\ncise short-term load forecasting in the residential level places a significant role in\nsystem operation. In [20], the author proposes a load decomposition-based fore-\ncasting method in order to have a better forecasting result by summing several dis-\naggregated sub-load predictions. Unlike the load decomposition-based method, a\nload forecasting method in [21], which is based on measurement data from smart\nmeters, is applying clustering methods to identify the groups of customers who\nhave similar behaviors and load consumption patterns. Since machine learning\nhas achieved lots of success in prediction, the application of machine learning in\nthe power system has become an irresistible trend for many researchers. The ap-\nproaches in [16] [17] [18] [19] explore the customers\u2019 behavior learning using deep\n6\nneural network (DNN), which recently has become a highly prevalent research\nfield in many areas. Almost all of the paper studying in machine learning applica-\ntion area are applying recurrent neural network (RNN), which is a special type of\nDNN and have strong capability dealing with time-series data, and capturing the\nhidden factors behind the huge amount of measurement data.\nDemand response is one of DERs. Before analyzing the effect of any type of\ndemand response program, researchers should understand the calculation of con-\nsumption baseline, which is defined as the energy consumption that customers\nwill consume, if customers did not participate in the DR program at that time.\nHowever, the customers\u2019 consumption baseline is tricky in some sense because no\none can answer the question such as \u201cwhat if the customers didn\u2019t participate in\nthe demand response program, what would be their energy consumption?\u201d. In\n[22], the authors apply a demographic data-based decision tree method and k-\nmean to cluster the customers, and then they propose three baseline calculation\napproaches which are regression-based, similar day-based and morning adjust-\nment. The regression-based method in [22] is piecewise linear regression. How-\never, all the methods and framework mentioned in load forecasting [20] [21] [16]\n[17] [18] [19] can be directly exploited as customers\u2019 consumption baseline calcu-\nlation routines. The similar day-based method selects the days that have similar\ntemperature as event, and use the consumption in those days to calculate base-\nline. The morning adjustment method use the actual metered load in the morning\n7\nto adjust the consumption baseline for that day. There is a consumption baseline\nmethod mainly focusing on finding the control group in [14], which is defined\nas a group of selected customers whose daily consumption is treated as the base-\nline for others. Reference [15] studies the impact of social welfare loss and error\nanalysis for customers\u2019 consumption baseline. A comprehensive discussion of DR\nconsumption baseline calculation has been exhibited in [23].\nThe participation of DERs in the power system introduces the risk of dispatch-\ning residential DERs because of its characteristic of high uncertainty and variabil-\nity, which is mainly caused by the human-in-the-loop effect. A more accurate\nDERs output prediction method can be really influential when integrating DERs\nin the electric market. Multiple price elasticity-based methods have been devel-\noped in [24] [25] [26] [27] in order to capture the customers\u2019 price responsiveness\nunder different DR programs. Reference [25] utilizes five decreasing curve func-\ntions and seven sensitivity categories to represent customers\u2019 price responsiveness.\nReference [26] considers rational customer model maximizing welfare with utility\nfunctions and self and cross-time elasticity. Reference [27] builds a mathematical\nprice elasticity model to simulate customers\u2019 responsiveness. In [28], the authors\nconstruct an implementation framework using long short-term memory (LSTM),\nwhich is recurrent neural network, to predict customers\u2019 response behavior during\ndifferent DR programs\u2019 events. In [13], the authors construct possibility distribu-\ntion to represent the price responsiveness of the EV owners considering electricity\n8\nprice and demographic information. Monte Carlo method in [29] is applied for\nsimulating the EV owners\u2019 charging and discharging behavior. There is a satel-\nlite image based solar generation prediction method using SVM in [30] with com-\nparatively high accuracy. Reference [31] advances a hybrid algorithm utilizing\nan optimization model to provide initial parameters of artificial neural network\nwhich is trained later by shuffled frog leaping algorithm. Reference [32] applies\ndeep neural network framework to solar energy prediction problems and gains\na satisfactory performance. An advanced diffusion-based kernel density estima-\ntor equipped with a fuzzy inference system and adaptation function is utilized\nto achieve high quality and accuracy of wind power generation in [33]. A wind\npower forecasting approach is proposed in [34] in which the author obtains the\nstochastic distribution of locally wind energy by applying neural network-based\nclassification method utilizing global forecast system information. Reference [35]\nmodels the load demand, wind speed, and generator location are modeled accord-\ning to Gaussian, Weibull, and discrete uniform distribution functions, respectively.\nFor solar irradiance modeling, they cluster the data into two states which are high-\nirradiance state at daytime and low-irradiance state at night, and then they utilize\na kernel smoothing technique to estimate the pdf of the solar irradiance of two\nstates. Reference [36] uses k-mean to cluster daily PV output data and implements\nEpanechnikov kernel estimating technique to estimate the probability distribution\nof PV output. They also propose a way to approximate optimal solution of house-\n9\nhold energy management system using deep learning, SVM and ANN. Reference\n[37] proposes a deep learning-based short-term wind power forecasting algorithm\nby combining autoencoders, the back-propagation algorithm, and the genetic al-\ngorithm.\nSince the human-in-the-loop aspect of emerging distributed smart grid tech-\nnologies and energy prediction error, the uncertainty of DERs is necessary to be\nhighly addressed in the power system operation scheme. In [38], the authors han-\ndle the uncertainty by applying stochastic dominance constraints, which is widely\nused in economics and finance due to its relation to models of risk-averse pref-\nerence. References [39] [40] [41] [42] employ conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) in\ntheir optimization model to evaluate and control the risk of profit and cost vari-\nability of dispatching virtual power plant (VPP) because of its uncertainty and\nvariability nature. In [43] [44], the authors come up with various special risk in-\ndices to assess the risk of DERs when integrating them into the power system. A\nfuzzy chance constrained programming approach to day-ahead scheduling VPP\nconsidering the uncertainty of DERs and its risk of dispatching is proposed in [45].\nIn this paper, the author associates uncertain factors in VPP with fuzzy parame-\nters and fuzzy chance constraints, and also provide different confidence levels for\nthe economy and risk sensitively of VPP. Reference [46] utilizes expected value\nand zero-mean normally distributed random variable with a standard deviation\nto represent the output and uncertainty of DERs. A scenario-based risk analysis\n10\nof VPP is introduced in [47], which accounts for the temporal correlation of solar\nand wind generation. Unlike [47], the authors in [48] directly generate scenarios\nbased on price and load and applies stochastic programming to risk analysis ap-\nproach with approximation. Reference [48] presents a robust optimization-based\ndaily and weekly scheduling of VPP. The authors in [48] treats uncertainty of DERs\nas uncertainty control parameters embedded in their robust optimization model.\nReference [49] combines chance-constraint with second-order-cone ACOPF. Refer-\nence [50] formulates an optimization model as an estimator to predict a group of\nDERs injection for the next time period. Their objective function is minimizing the\nsquare error between estimated values and true values, which subjects to a DERs\ncontroller\u2019s biased term.\n1.5 Organization of this thesis\nIn chapter 2, the data, machine learning algorithms and analysis approach de-\nscription are presented. In chapter 3, the results of the local utility project are\nexhibited. Simulation results, using chance-constraint based SOCP-ACOPF, are\nshown in chapter 4.\n11\nChapter 2\nDATA DESCRIPTION AND APPROACH\nIn the chapter, the description of local utility datasets and the explanation of\nthe analyzing approach will be presented. The results of the local utility work will\nbe shown in the next chapter.\n2.1 Data Description\nFour different residential customers\u2019 consumption datasets from the local util-\nity are used for the purpose of this project. The first, second and third consumption\ndatasets are used to analyze customers\u2019 behavior and price responsiveness in the\nlocal utility time of use (TOU) price plan. It is pertinent to note that three differ-\nent TOU plans are mainly analyzed in this project, which are E21, E23 and E26.\nThe detailed information of those three TOU plans is exhibited in the following\nsection.

This approach\nis implemented to analyze all of the four datasets. The flowchart of the proposed\napproach is shown in Fig. 2.1. First, several different categories are formed using\ncustomers\u2019 demographic data. Besides, three regression-based ML algorithms are\napplied to attain customers\u2019 baseload using their consumption data in off-peak\nperiods. After that, the DR reduction values are calculated using the predicted\ncustomers\u2019 baseload and actual consumption during the on-peak periods. Finally,\ncustomers\u2019 behavior during on-peak periods and their price responsiveness are\nevaluated from the same category to different DR programs\n19\nFigure 2.1: Approach Flowchart\n2.2.1 Machine Learning\nThree machine learning algorithms are implemented to predict customers\u2019 baseload\nduring the on-peak periods. The following well-established regression-based cus-\ntomers\u2019 baseload calculation methods, which captures the relationship between\nthe consumption values vector for the next time period Y and previous consump-\ntion values matrix X , are used in this paper.\n\u2022 Artificial Neural Network (ANN)\n\u2022 K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n\u2022 Ridge Regression (RR)\n2.2.2 Artificial Neural Network (ANN)\nANN, which is inspired by biological neural networks that constitute animal\nbrains, is a prevalent research topic in many areas recently. The general structure\n20\nof ANN includes input, hidden and output layer.\nFor the input to hidden units we have:\nath =\nI\u2211\nh\u2032=1\nwh\u2032hb\nt\u22121\nh\u2032 (2.1)\nbth = \u03b8ha(\nt\nh) (2.2)\nwhere wh\u2032h are the weights between neuron h\u2032 in layer t \u2212 1 and neuron h in\nlayer t. The bt\u22121h\u2032 are the inputs of neuron h\n\u2032 from the last layer t \u2212 1. The I is the\nnumber of neurons in the layer t \u2212 1. The ath is sum of wh\u2032hbt\u22121h\u2032 from the last layer.\nThe \u03b8 is activation function for the neuron h. The bth are the output of neuron h in\nlayer t. It will be the input to the layer t+ 1.\nFor the output unit we have:\natk =\nH\u2211\nh=1\nwhkb\nt\nh (2.3)\nwhere the whk are weights and bth are inputs from the last hidden layer. The H\nis the number of neurons in the last layer. The atk will be the output of the ANN\nmodel, if the output layer is the t-th layer and has k neurons.\nCommon one-layer ANN structure and ANN neuron mathematical represen-\ntation have been shown in Fig. 2.2 and Fig. 2.3.\nDue to its structure, ANN can have a higher ability to fit into highly nonlinear\nfunctions. The higher number of hidden layers in ANN results in improved capa-\n21\nFigure 2.2: One-layer ANN Structure\nFigure 2.3: ANN Neuron Mathematical Representation\nbility of the model to extract more abstracted features from the input. However,\nthe drawbacks of ANN are its less interpretability and obtaining local optimal so-\n22\nlutions.\n2.2.3 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\nKNN is a non-parametric ML algorithm used for classification and regression\nproblems. For the regression problem, KNN first calculates the distance for each\nsample. The distance can be calculated by different distance functions such as\nEuclidean, Manhattan and Minkowski function. To forecast the response to a new\nsample, the trained model uses k samples that are closest to the new data point.\nFigure 2.4: A Schema of KNN Algorithm\nFig. 2.4 shows a schema of the KNN algorithm. In Fig. 2.4, we need to predict\nthe response of the yellow point. The KNN algorithm will find the k points that\nare closest to the yellow point and use their values to predict the response of the\n23\nyellow point.\n2.2.4 Ridge Regression (RR)\nRR is a commonly used algorithm that deals with linear or near-linear data. The\nloss function of the ridge regression is the combination of the linear least squares\nfunction and regularization given by the l2-norm (also called Euclidean norm).\nThe objective function can be mathematically be written as below,\nmin\nN\u2211\nn=1\n(Yn \u2212W TXn)2 + \u03bbW TW (2.4)\nwhere the N is the number of samples in the training matrix. The Yn is the\nresponse of each sample. The W T is the weight for each independent variable Xn.\nThe \u03bb is the hyper-parameter used in the regularization term. Note that the RR is\nstrict convex, which guarantees a global optimal solution.\n2.2.5 Baseload Prediction\nThe customers\u2019 baseload is defined as the answer to the question of \u201cHow much\nthey would consume if they do not participate in DR\u201d.\nFor the purpose of this study, customers\u2019 consumption usage and their DR on-\npeak load reduction are analyzed for groups of customers instead of each individ-\nual household. The off-peak period consumption values and ML algorithms are\nused to build the customers\u2019 baseload model for the on-peak periods.\n24\nSince the resolution of the first and second datasets is 15-mins and resolution\nof the third and fourth datasets is one hour, we make different assumptions before\nbuilding customers\u2019 baseload model.\nFor the first and second datasets, due to their 15-mins resolution, if we use more\nthan prior 8 hours consumption values, the accuracy of the baseload model is high\nenough to predict customers\u2019 baseload. Besides, the accuracy only slightly changes\nif we increase the number of prior hours consumption values that are used for\ntraining the ML algorithms. Thus, we utilize consumption values from 8 previous\nhours as features in the training matrix and assume that the group\u2019s consumption\nvalues are only correlated to the previous 8 hours of group\u2019s consumption values.\nThe presentation of the first and second data baseload models can be presented\nusing (2.5),\nP (Y |x1, x2, ..., x32) (2.5)\nwhere Y is the consumption value of the group for the next time interval.\nx1, x2, ..., x32 are the prior 8 hours historical consumption values with 15-min res-\nolution. All of the values in (2.5) are the consumption values during the off-peak\nperiod.\nFor the third and fourth datasets, the accuracy of the baseload model changes\na lot, if we use a different number for previous hours consumption. The relation-\nship between model accuracy and the number of prior hours consumption is tested\n25\nusing a group of customers\u2019 data whose demographic information are all 1-2 occu-\npants in the house, livable space less 1500 sqft and start date of becoming local util-\nity customers after 2016. The start date is the date that the customer becomes local\nutility\u2019s customer. For the third and fourth data baseload estimation, we finally use\nthe prior 6 hours of consumption values and assume that the group\u2019s consumption\nvalues for the next time period are only correlated to customers\u2019 consumption val-\nues of the previous prior 6 hours. The prediction error of the baseload model for\ndifferent training structures is shown in Fig. 2.5. Root-mean-square error (note\nequation (2.7) in the next page) is used as a measure of prediction error. Fig. 2.5\nshows that the most accurate baseload prediction is obtained when the off-peak\nconsumption values of the prior 6 hours are used for training the ML algorithms.\nFigure 2.5: Trained Model Accuracy Testing for Third and Fourth Dataset\nThe presentation of the third and fourth data baseload model can be shown in\n26\n(2.6),\nP (Y |x1, x2, ..., x6) (2.6)\nwhere Y is the consumption value of the group for the next time interval.\nx1, x2, ..., x6 are the prior 6 hours historical consumption values with one-hour res-\nolution. All of the values in (6) are the consumption values during the off-peak\nperiod.\n2.2.6 Training\nScikit-learn is used to implement the ANN, KNN and RR algorithms, which\nis a machine learning library embedded in Python. A three-hidden-layers ANN\nstructure is built in this project and the hyper-parameter of KNN is set to be 3. The\ncoefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) are used to\nevaluate the performance of the trained model. These metrics are presented in\n(2.7)-(2.8),\nR2 = 1\u2212\n\u2211\ni(yi \u2212 ypredicti )2\u2211\ni(yi \u2212 ymean)2\n(2.7)\nRMSE =\n\u221a\u2211T\ni=1(y\npredict\ni \u2212 yi)2\nT\n(2.8)\nwhere yi is the actual value for the test sample i. The y\npredict\ni is the predicted\nvalue for the test sample i. The ymean is the average value for the T test samples.\n27\nNote that the closer R2 value is to 1, the more accurate the baseload model is. The\nsmaller RMSE represents a higher accuracy of prediction.\n2.2.7 Consumption Baseline Accuracy: First and Second Datasets\nAs mentioned before, the customer categories are formed based on customers\u2019\ndemographic information. For each class of customers, e.g. medium income with\n1-2 occupants and no child, groups of 20-100 customers are formed. Different ML\nalgorithms are trained for each group to predict their baseload load. Table 2.4 lists\nthe accuracy of the trained model for the first and second datasets where the res-\nolution is 15-mins. The prior 8 hours consumption values are used to train the\nmodel. The results suggest that the model accuracy increases when larger sample\ngroups are used. The more people in the training model, the more accurate the\ntrained model is. The models trained by ANN and RR have higher accuracy com-\npared with the trained model using KNN. However, ANN needs more training\ntime. Thus, in most of the cases, RR is utilized to get customers\u2019 baseload.\nIn order to exhibit the accuracy of the trained model, the actual values versus\npredicted values are shown in Fig. 2.6. The test samples are randomly picked\nfrom the test data. The evaluation metric values are shown in the figures. Fig. 2.6\nconfirms that the trained model is able to predict the baseload consumption with\nvery high accuracy.\nAs can be seen, some of the predicted values exactly match the true values.\nFurthermore, Fig. 2.7 presents an exemplary result of consumption baseline load\n28\nTable 2.4: Accuracy of the Trained Model for Different Size of Customers\u2019 Group:\nMedium Income, 1-2 occupants, no Child\nMetrics Number of\nCustomers\nANN KNN RR\nR2 20 0.900 0.880 0.908\nRMSE (kW) 20 6.240 6.852 5.986\nR2 30 0.943 0.932 0.948\nRMSE (kW) 30 7.259 7.900 6.883\nR2 50 0.959 0.944 0.962\nRMSE (kW) 50 10.001 11.703 9.644\nR2 100 0.982 0.974 0.983\nRMSE (kW) 100 14.328 17.002 13.961\ncalculation.\nNote that Fig. 2.7 shows the off-peak and on-peak periods in order to provide a\ncomparison to actual and predicted summed consumption values on Jul. 3rd. Due\nto the highly accurate baseload load model, in the following study, the customers\u2019\nbaseloads predicted by these trained models are considered as their true baseload.\n29\nFigure 2.6: An Example of Trained Model Accuracy for First and Second Round\nDataset\nFigure 2.7: An Exemplary Result of Baseload Load Calculation: Aggreated\nConsumption of 60 Customers\n30\n2.2.8 Consumption Baseline Accuracy: Third and Fourth Datasets\nSimilarly, the customer categories are formed based on customers\u2019 demographic\ninformation using third and fourth datasets. Table 2.5 presents the accuracy of the\ntrained model for the third and fourth datasets, the resolution of which is one hour.\nThe same effect can be seen in Table 2.5. The model accuracy increases when larger\nsample groups are used. The models trained by ANN and RR have higher accu-\nracy compared with the trained model using KNN. For the analysis of the third\nand fourth dataset, RR is used to predict customers\u2019 baseload model.\nDue to the difference of resolution, the accuracy of the trained model and an\nexemplary result of baseload calculation are shown in Fig. 2.8 and Fig. 2.9. The\ntest samples are randomly picked from the test data. Furthermore, the evaluation\nmetric values are shown in Fig. 2.8.\nFigure 2.8: An Example of Trained Model Accuracy for Third and Fourth Round\nDataset\n31\nTable 2.5: Accuracy of the Trained Model for Different Size of Customers\u2019 Group:\n1-2 occupants, less1500sqft, after 2016\nMetrics Number of\nCustomers\nANN KNN RR\nR2 20 0.935 0.914 0.940\nRMSE (kW) 20 4.220 4.871 4.074\nR2 30 0.943 0.943 0.942\nRMSE (kW) 30 5.601 5.591 5.657\nR2 50 0.955 0.940 0.955\nRMSE (kW) 50 8.349 9.644 8.354\nR2 100 0.974 0.970 0.973\nRMSE (kW) 100 13.124 14.028 13.174\nAs can be seen, the baseload models for the third and fourth datasets are highly\naccurate. Some of the predicted values exactly match the true values.\n32\nFigure 2.9: An Exemplary Result of Baseload Calculation: Aggreated\nConsumption of 60 Customers\nNote that Fig. 2.9 shows the off-peak and on-peak periods in order to provide\na comparison to actual and predicted summed consumption values on Jul. 3rd.\nDue to the highly accurate baseload model, in the following analysis of the third\nand fourth datasets, the customers\u2019 baseloads predicted by these trained models\nare considered as their true baseload.\nThe datasets provided by SRP is shown in this chapter. The machine learn-\ning algorithms, including ANN, KNN, and KRR, are utilized to predict customers\u2019\nbaseload during the on-peak period. The trained baseload model is highly accu-\nrate. The customers\u2019 consumption baseloads predicted by the trained baseload\nmodel in chapter 3 are considered as customers\u2019 true baseload.\n33\nChapter 3\nPROJECT RESULTS\nThe first and second datasets analysis will be shown in this chapter first. The\nthird dataset analysis and corresponding one demographic factor analysis will be\npresented next. Finally, the analysis of the fourth dataset, which is emergency\ndemand response data, will be exhibited.\n3.1 First and Second Datasets Analysis\n3.1.1 Customers Responsiveness for the First and Second Datasets\nFor the first and second dataset analysis, a decision-tree-like approach is ap-\nplied to categorize customers based on their demographic information such as in-\ncome level, number of occupants, and if they have Children. However, the cus-\ntomers are randomly picked from the local utility data pool and the demographic\ndata information of those customers is not evenly distributed. For some of the\ndemographic categories, there are only a few customers, which is not enough to\nconduct the data-driven analysis. Due to this issue, we mainly focus on the fol-\nlowing seven categories shown in Table 3.1 for this study.\nThe analysis of the first and second datasets for the E21 has been shown in Fig.\n3.1, 3.2 and 3.3. The blue bar shows the average predicted consumption during the\n34\nTable 3.1: Analyzed Demographic Categories for the First Round Dataset\nCategories Income Level Number of Occupants Child\n1 High-Income 1-2 people no child\n2 High-Income 3-5 people no child\n3 High-Income 3-5 people have children\n4 Medium-Income 1-2 people no child\n5 Medium-Income 3-5 people no child\n6 Medium-Income 3-5 people have children\n7 Low-Income 1-2 people no child\non-peak periods. The orange bars represent the average load reduction during the\non-peak periods. The red percentage values are the percentage of load reduction\nfor each category. For each demographic category, 60 customers are aggregated\nand analyzed as a group. Table 2.4 confirms that an accurate prediction can be\nobtained with this number of customers in a group. The detailed baseload model\naccuracy can be seen in the Appendix.\nAs can be seen, the category \u201cHigh-income, 3 to 5 occupants, having child\u201d has\nthe highest energy consumption and load reduction during on-peak. It is revealed\nthat if having children may have a great impact on high-income customer groups.\nIn contrast, the least percentage reduction is observed for low-income customers.\n35\nFigure 3.1: First Round Dataset Analysis for E21 Summer Peak, 60 Households in\nEach Group\nFigure 3.2: First Round Dataset Analysis for E21 Summer (May and Jun), 60\nHouseholds in Each Group\n36\nFigure 3.3: First Round Dataset Analysis for E21 Summer (Sep and Oct), 60\nHouseholds in Each Group\nThe lower percentage of consumption reduction can have multiple reasons. For\nexample, this group of customers may not have programmable thermostats, or\nmaybe pre-occupied with different other life challenges. To further understand this\ngroup, a more detail analysis of this group is conducted using the second dataset.\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude that the income level is greatly related to the\ncustomers\u2019 behavior during the on-peak periods. Comparing Fig. 3.1, 3.2, and\n3.3, the load reduction value is higher during the Summer Peak periods, which is\nconsistent with the designed incentives, i.e. higher on-peak pricing.\nThe analysis of the first and second datasets for the E26 DR program is also\nshown in Fig. 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6.\nAs can be seen from Fig. 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6, the average load reduction values\n37\nFigure 3.4: First Round Dataset Analysis for E26 Summer Peak, 60 Households in\nEach Group\nFigure 3.5: First Round Dataset Analysis for E26 Summer (May and Jun), 60\nHouseholds in Each Group\n38\nFigure 3.6: First Round Dataset Analysis for E26 Summer (Sep and Oct), 60\nHouseholds in Each Group\nof E26 customers during on-peak periods are very small compared with the re-\nductions in E21. We even find negative values. However, the variance of load\nreduction for E26 is large, and the average representation of results is inconclu-\nsive. We further present the result of E26 and E21 in the next section and give the\nexplanation of why the average load reduction of E26 is small or even negative.\nThe detailed analysis results in this section are exhibited in Appendix.\n3.1.2 Detailed Analysis for the First and Second Datasets\nTwo exemplary plots of average consumption comparison for E21 and E26 have\nbeen shown in Fig. 3.7 and Fig. 3.8. The blue curve shows the predicted customers\u2019\nbaseload during the on-peak periods. The red curve represents the actual energy\n39\nFigure 3.7: An Example of Average Consumption Comparison for \u201cHigh-Income,\n3-5 Occupants, No Child\u201d Category During On-Peak Period in July and August\nE21\nFigure 3.8: An Example of Average Consumption Comparison for \u201cHigh-Income,\n3-5 Occupants, No Child\u201d Category During On-Peak Period in July and August\nE26\nconsumption. As can be seen in Fig. 3.7, there is a clear load reduction and load\nshifting effect happening during the on-peak periods. However, in Fig. 3.8, due\nto the long on-peak periods and smaller price gap, the customers who participate\n40\nin the E26 tend to reduce their loads at the beginning of the on-peak periods. Af-\nter that, when the time is close to 6 p.m., people may come back home and need\nto consume more electricity, such as cooking, which leads to increased electricity\nconsumption and less responsiveness to on-peak pricing. However, the load re-\nduction effect can be seen again when the time is close to the end of the on-peak\nperiods. We can see the actual load consumption is almost changing around the\npredicted consumption.\nFigure 3.9: An Example of Daily Consumption Comparison in July 3rd for\n\u201cHigh-Income, 3-5 Occupants, Have Child\u201d Category During On-Peak Period in\nJuly and August E21\nTwo exemplary plots of daily consumption comparison E21 and E26 are shown\nin Fig. 3.9 and Fig. 3.10. Fig. 3.9 and Fig. 3.10 show an example of daily actual and\npredicted load consumption curve. Although the red curve is not smooth like the\naverage load curve, we can still clearly observe the load reduction and load shifting\n41\nFigure 3.10: An Example of Daily Consumption Comparison in July 3rd for\n\u201cHigh-Income, 3-5 Occupants, Have Child\u201d Category During On-Peak Period in\nJuly and August E26\neffect in the E21 plot. Moreover, the behavior of the customers who participate in\nE26 is further shown in this figure. The predicted baseload values are really close\nto the actual consumption values, which means that the customers in E26 provide\nless average load reduction during the on-peak periods.\nTwo histogram examples of load reductions for E21 and E26 customers are il-\nlustrated in Fig. 3.11 and Fig. 3.12. The load reduction values during the on-peak\nperiods almost follow a Gaussian distribution. Most of load reduction values in\nE21 are positive. However, almost half of the load reduction values in E26 are neg-\native, and the center of them is around 0. The variance of load reduction in E26 is\nslightly higher than the variance of load reduction in E21, which is mainly due to\nthe long on-peak periods.\n42\nFigure 3.11: An Example of Load Reduction Histogram for \u201cHigh-Income, 1-2\nOccupants, No Child\u201d Category During On-Peak Period in July and August E21\nFigure 3.12: An Example of Load Reduction Histogram for \u201cHigh-Income, 1-2\nOccupants, No Child\u201d Category During On-Peak Period in July and August E26\nTwo scatter plot examples for the E21 and E26 comparison during the on-peak\nperiod has been shown in Fig. 3.13 and Fig. 3.14.The two scatter plots show the\nchanging of the uncertainty of customers\u2019 behavior as time changing. For the cus-\n43\nFigure 3.13: An Example of Scatter Plot for the E21 Comparison for\n\u201cHigh-Income, 1-2 Occupants, No Child\u201d Category During On-Peak Period in\nJuly and August E21\nFigure 3.14: An Example of Scatter Plot for the E26 Comparison for\n\u201cHigh-Income, 1-2 Occupants, No Child\u201d Category During On-Peak Period in\nJuly and August E26\n44\ntomers in E21, almost all of the load reduction points are positive, and the un-\ncertainty of customers\u2019 behavior is larger towards the end of the on-peak period.\nThe behavior uncertainty of customers in E26 becomes more random after 6 p.m.\nin Fig. 3.14. This again shows the fact that after around 6 p.m. people come back\nhome, and the uncertainty of behavior of customers is increased due to their essen-\ntial electricity usage, e.g. cooking appliances. These two figures present the impact\nof on-peak electric price and duration on customers\u2019 behavior and the changing of\ncustomers\u2019 price responsiveness during the on-peak periods.\n3.2 Third Datasets Analysis\n3.2.1 Customers Responsiveness for the Third Dataset\nThe third dataset contains only low-income customers in the local utility. For\nanalyzing the dataset of low-income customers, we focus on three demographic\nfactors, including the number of occupants and two new factors: livable space\nand start date. The start date refers to when the customer participated in the local\nutility program. The customers whose start date is before 2016 are considered old\ncustomers in this study. The customers whose start date is after 2016 are treated\nas new customers in this study. The old customers are assumed to have more\nknowledge and experience about their current DR plans than new customers. The\nsame approach is used to analyze low-income customers\u2019 consumption during the\non-peak periods.\n45\nThere are 60 households in each group in order to keep a highly accurate baseload\nmodel. There are enough customers to train a highly accurate baseload model, ex-\ncept the following three categories for E26 low-income customers.\n\u2022 6-max Occupants, Less 1500 sqft, After 2016\n\u2022 1 2 Occupants, More 2500 sqft, After 2016\n\u2022 6 max Occupants, More 2500 sqft, After 2016\nWe have not included these three categories in this analysis.\nThere are a few categories in which there are less than 60 customers. However,\nthe accuracy of the baseload model is still relatively high with less than 60 cus-\ntomers. We included these categories in our analysis. The detailed low-income\ncustomers\u2019 analysis results have been shown in the Appendix. In order to exhibit\nbetter results visualization, several plots are shown below. In these figures, the\nimpact of the number of occupants and livable space on the customers\u2019 behavior\nduring the on-peak periods is revealed while the start date is fixed.\nFig. 3.15 and Fig. 3.16 show the same results with two different arrangements\nin order to facilitate visual analysis of the impact of the number of occupants and\nlivable space on low-income customers\u2019 consumption reduction during on-peak\nperiods when the start date is fixed as \u2018after 2016\u2019. As can be seen, the customers\u2019\npercentage of load reduction values are increasing as the number of occupants or\nthe livable space increases. The new local utility customers (start date is \u2018after\n46\nFigure 3.15: An Example of Results Visualization for Low-Income Customers in\nSummer Peak E21: Fixed Start Date (After 2016), Compare Impact of Number of\nOccupants\nFigure 3.16: An Example of Results Visualization for Low-Income Customers in\nSummer Peak E21: Fixed Start Date (After 2016), Compare Livable Space\n47\n2016\u2019) tend to reduce more load during the on-peak periods, if they have more\nlivable space or there are more people living in the house.\nFigure 3.17: An Example of Results Visualization for Low-Income Customers in\nSummer Peak E21: Fixed Start Date (Before 2016), Compare Impact of Number of\nOccupants\nFig. 3.17 and Fig. 3.18 exhibit the impact of the number of occupants and\nlivable space on the old low-income local utility customers\u2019 behavior. As can be\nseen, the old low-income local utility customers\u2019 behavior almost follows the same\ntrend during the on-peak periods, except the customers in 1-2 occupant, \u201c1500 2500\nsqft, before 2016\u201d category. In Fig. 3.17 and Fig. 3.18, the behavior of old low-\nincome local utility customers has been shown. The number of occupants and\nlivable space play an important role in residential customers\u2019 behavior during the\non-peak periods.\nFig. 3.19 shows the percentage of load reduction comparison for start date (af-\n48\nFigure 3.18: An Example of Results Visualization for Low-Income Customers in\nSummer Peak E21: Fixed Start Date (Before 2016), Compare Livable Space\nFigure 3.19: An Example of Results Visualization for Low-Income Customers in\nSummer Peak E21: Impact of Start Date (Old and New Customers)\nter 2016 and before 2016) for E21. From Fig. 3.19, in most of the cases, the old\ncustomers provide more percentage of load reduction, except three customers cat-\n49\negories, which are \u201c6 max people, more 2500 sqft\u201d, \u201c1 2 people, more 2500 sqft\u201d,\nand \u201c6 max, less 1500 sqft\u201d. However, note that there are not enough customers in\n\u201c6 max people, more 2500 sqft\u201d and \u201c1 2 people, more 2500 sqft\u201d categories. Only\n22 customers are in \u201c6 max people, more 2500 sqft\u201d category, and 55 customers in\nthe \u201c6 max people, more 2500 sqft\u201d category. One reason why the load reduction\nvalues don\u2019t follow the same trend (the new customers in these two categories pro-\nvide more percentage of load reduction than old customers) is the data bias issue.\nHowever, there is one special category which is the \u201c6 max, less 1500 sqft\u201d for E21.\nThere are enough customers in this category, but the new customers in this cate-\ngory are willing to provide more percentage of load reduction compared with the\nold customers.\n3.2.2 Detailed Analysis for the Third dataset\nThe variance of load reduction for E26 low-income customers is large, the aver-\nage representation of results is inconclusive. Thus, we present the detailed result\nof E26 and E21 low-income customers in the following sections.\nFig. 3.20, Fig. 3.21, Fig. 3.22 and Fig. 3.23 present the average customers\u2019\nbaseload and average customers actual energy consumption. The blue curve shows\nthe predicted customers\u2019 baseload during the on-peak periods. The red curve rep-\nresents the actual energy consumption. The four figures show the impact of de-\nmographic factors, electric price, and duration on customers\u2019 behavior during the\non-peak periods. In Fig. 3.20, the load reduction of customers in \u201c1500 2500 sqft, 1-\n50\nFigure 3.20: An Example of Average Consumption Comparison for \u201c1500 2500\nsqft, 1-2 Occupants, After 2016\u201d Category During On-Peak Period in July and\nAugust E21\nFigure 3.21: An Example of Average Consumption Comparison for \u201cMore Than\n2500 sqft, More Than 6 Occupants, Before 2016\u201d Category During On-Peak Period\nin July and August E21\n51\nFigure 3.22: An Example of Average Consumption Comparison for \u201c1500 2500\nsqft, 1-2 Occupants, After 2016\u201d Category During On-Peak Period in July and\nAugust E26\nFigure 3.23: An Example of Average Consumption Comparison for \u201c1500 2500\nsqft, 3-5 Occupants, Before 2016\u201d Category During On-Peak Period in July and\nAugust E26\n52\n2 Occupants, After 2016\u201d category is smaller than the load reduction of customers\nin \u201cMore Than 2500 sqft, More Than 6 Occupants, Before 2016\u201d category. In Fig.\n3.22, the load reduction effect can be seen all over the on-peak periods for the E26\nprogram. However, Fig. 3.23 shows that customers may increase energy consump-\ntion level during the on-peak periods. As can be seen, the intersection point of the\nbaseload curve and actual consumption curve is very close to the time when the\npeople usually come back home after work. The customers\u2019 consumption is greater\nthan the predicted baseload. This is the reason why there is negative average load\nreduction for some of the categories. These customers consume less energy at the\nbeginning of the on-peak periods, but when they go home, the energy consump-\ntion rise and exceed the predicted baseload. It leads to a negative calculated load\nreduction value.\nFigure 3.24: An Example of Load Reduction Histogram for \u201cLess 1500 sqft, 3-5\nOccupants, After 2016\u201d Category During On-Peak Period in July and August E21\n53\nFigure 3.25: An Example of Load Reduction Histogram for \u201cLess 1500 sqft, 3-5\nOccupants, After 2016\u201d Category During On-Peak Period in July and August E26\nFig. 3.24 and Fig. 3.25 show the histogram of on-peak reduction values for E21\nand E26 low-income customers. As can be seen, the reduction values almost follow\na Gaussian distribution. In Fig. 3.24, the mean of reduction values is positive and\nclose to 30 kW. However, the mean of reduction values in Fig. 3.25 is close to 0 kW.\nWe can observe several negative values in Fig. 3.24, but lots of negative values in\nFig. 3.25. This shows the reason why the most of percentage values of average load\nreduction of E26 customers in Appendix table are small or even negative, while\nmost of the percentage values of average load reduction of E21 customers are large\nand non-negative. The two figures also illustrate the impact of on-peak electric\nprice and duration on the customer\u2019s behavior. Higher on-peak electric price and\nsmaller duration lead to a higher customers\u2019 price responsiveness during the on-\npeak periods.\n54\nFigure 3.26: An Example of Scatter Plot for the E21 Comparison for \u201c1500 2500\nsqft, 3-5 Occupants, After 2016\u201d Category During On-Peak Period in July and\nAugust E21\nFigure 3.27: An Example of Scatter Plot for the E21 Comparison for \u201c1500 2500\nsqft, 3-5 Occupants, After 2016\u201d Category During On-Peak Period in July and\nAugust E26\n55\nTwo exemplary scatter plots are shown in Fig. 3.26 and Fig. 3.27, which exhibits\nthe details of customers\u2019 price responsiveness for each the on-peak intervals. Many\nlarge positive load reduction values are observed in Fig. 3.26. The variance is\nalmost unchanged. However, as can be seen, the variance of load reduction values\nincreases over time in Fig. 3.27, which means that the customers\u2019 behavior becomes\nmore random when it gets close to the end of the on-peak periods. A large load\nreduction variance is observed after 5 pm. It is time for people to come home from\nwork, and people have their own schedule after coming back home. For example,\nthey may need to use more energy for a series of behavior such as cooking and\nwatching TV. This results in more negative load reduction values that are observed,\nand the increased uncertainty of customers\u2019 behavior.\n3.2.3 One Demographic Factor Analysis for the Third Dataset\nIn this third dataset analysis, one demographic factor analysis is used to reveal\nwhich demographic factors have the largest impact on low-income customers\u2019 be-\nhavior during on-peak periods. The same approach is used for one demographic\nfactor analysis. For each demographic factor analysis, all of the customers who\nhave the same demographic factors are used. This analysis exhibits the impact of\nthe household\u2019s livable space, number of occupants and start date on low-income\ncustomers\u2019 price responsiveness during the on-peak periods. Percentage of aver-\nage load reduction values are considered in this analysis. The detailed analysis\nresults are shown in the Appendix.\n56\nFigure 3.28: Percentage of Load Reduction During On-Peak, An Example of One\nDemographic Factor Analysis for the E21: Livable Space\nFigure 3.29: Percentage of Load Reduction During On-Peak, An Example of One\nDemographic Factor Analysis for the E26: Livable Space\nFig. 3.28 and Fig. 3.29 show the impact of the household\u2019s livable space. As\ncan be seen, the household\u2019s livable space plays an important role in low-income\n57\ncustomers\u2019 responsiveness. The larger the house is, the higher the percentage of\nload reduction the customers tend to provide during the on-peak periods for both\nE21 and E26 low-income customers. This is expected as people with smaller living\nspace may have a less flexible load (e.g. only one air conditioning unit versus two\nfor larger living spaces) to reduce their consumption. E21 low-income customers\nprovide more load reduction comparing with E26 low-income customers. In Fig.\n3.28, the E21 low-income customers who live in a house having more than 2500\nsqft provide more than twice the load reduction as much as the customers who\nlive in a house having 1500 to 2500 sqft. The E21 low-income customers who live\nin a house having 1500 to 2500 sqft provide almost twice the load reduction as\nmuch as the customers who live in a house having less than 1500 sqft. In Fig. 3.29,\nonly a small difference between each class can be observed. The percentage of load\nreduction values in Fig. 3.29 are small compared with the values in Fig. 3.28.\nFig. 3.30 and Fig. 3.31 exhibit the impact of the number of occupants. For\nE21 low-income customers, the more occupants living in the house, the more load\nreduction they tend to provide during the on-peak periods. The households that\nhave 3-5 occupants reduce twice as much as the households that have 1-2 occu-\npants. The households having more than 6 occupants provide the largest percent-\nage of load reduction. However, for E26 low-income customers, the households\nthat have 3 5 occupants provide the least load reduction, while the households\nthat more than 6 occupants provide the most load reduction. As can be seen, the\n58\nFigure 3.30: Percentage of Load Reduction During On-Peak, An Example of One\nDemographic Factor Analysis for the E21: Number of Occupants\nFigure 3.31: Percentage of Load Reduction During On-Peak, An Example of One\nDemographic Factor Analysis for the E26: Number of Occupants\nE26 low-income customers percentage of load reduction values are much smaller\nthan E21 low-income customers\u2019 percentage of load reduction values.\n59\nFigure 3.32: Percentage of Load Reduction During On-Peak, An Example of One\nDemographic Factor Analysis for the E21: Start Date\nFigure 3.33: Percentage of Load Reduction During On-Peak, An Example of One\nDemographic Factor Analysis for the E26: Start Date\nAnother analysis compares the load reduction effect between the new cus-\ntomers (start date before 2016) and the old customers (start date after 2016) in Fig.\n60\n3.32 and Fig. 3.33. As can be seen, for E21 low-income customers, the old cus-\ntomers tend to provide more load reduction and new customers reduce less dur-\ning the on-peak period. This result shows that the customers start to learn their\nprice plan policy and how to adjust their consumption in response to the on-peak\npricing after they continue to be local utility customers for more than a certain\nperiod of time. These customers get more knowledge and experience over time.\nThis knowledge and experience lead customers how to make a rational choice in\norder to save some money for their electric bill. However, for E26 low-income cus-\ntomers, this start date has the opposite effect. The new customers tend to provide\nmore load reduction and old customers reduce less during the on-peak period. It is\nshown that more experience of their TOU plan makes customers pay less attention\nto the on-peak load reduction. The main reason why this happens is that the on-\npeak price of E21 is much larger than the on-peak price of E26, while the on-peak\nduration of E26 is much longer than the on-peak duration of E21.\n3.3 Fourth Dataset Analysis\n3.3.1 Customers Responsiveness for the Fourth Dataset\nThe Fourth dataset contains all local utility customers who participated in the\nemergency demand response (EDR) program with different rate policies in 2018.\nFor each customer in this dataset, there is a smart nest thermostat installed. SPR\ncommunicates each DR event through the customers\u2019 thermostat. Nest thermostat\n61\nallows local utility to control the thermostat temperature, however, the customers\nhave the right to re-adjust their device at any time. Thermostat settings during an\nevent may seem extreme and may adjust frequently. These settings are designed to\nmaximize the pre-cooling or conservation impacts. DR events typically occur be-\ntween noon and 9 p.m. on weekdays only (holidays excluded). Customers receive\nlocal utility bill credit for participating in this program.\nIn this dataset, there are totally 9 DR events in 2018. The event time has been\npresented in Table 1. In this analysis, we mainly focus on E23 customers. Note that\nE23 is the flat rate for residential customers in local utility. The same strategy in\nthe third dataset analysis is used to predict customers\u2019 baseload. However, due to\nthe characteristic of EDR, utility needs to notify customers one hour in advance.\nThis issue impacts customers electricity consumption within one hour before the\nbeginning of the DR event. Thus, we predict customers\u2019 baseload from one hour\nbefore the beginning of the DR event.\n3.3.2 All E23 Customers Analysis for the Fourth Dataset\nAn analysis is conducted for all E23 customers in the fourth dataset.\nFig. 3.34 shows an example of baseload prediction for the fourth dataset for\nonly E23 customers. The blue curve is the predicted baseload. The red curve is\nthe actual customers consumption. The two red marked points are the start and\nend points of the DR event. The DR event time in Fig. 3.34 is 17:00 to 19:00 at\nJun/22/2018. As can be seen, customers reduce their load dramatically after the\n62\nFigure 3.34: An Example of EDR Consumption Baseline and Actual Consumption\nComparison for All E23 Customers at Jun/22/2018 (17:00 - 19:00)\nstart of the DR event. The customers consumption remains at a very low level\nduring the DR event. local utility adjusts the nest thermostat temperature setting to\nprecool the customers houses before the start of DR event and cool their customers\nhouse after the end of DR event, two spikes can be seen in Fig. 3.34. This shows\nthat the baseload model is accurate enough to detect the abnormal period before\nand after the DR event.\nFig. 3.35 and Fig. 3.36 present scatter plots of load reduction values during the\nDR events by grouping all E23 customers in the fourth dataset. Fig. 3.35 and Fig.\n3.36 exhibit the customers\u2019 load reduction and behavior during conservation pe-\nriods from two different aspects. Fig. 3.35 shows consumption reductions during\nvarious time periods of conservation events. Fig. 3.36 shows load reductions for\nfirst, second, and third intervals of all conservation events despite varying start\n63\nFigure 3.35: An Example of All E23 Customers Load Reduction Scatter Plot for\nEach Hour During the DR event at Jun/22/2018 (17:00 - 19:00)\nFigure 3.36: An Example of All E23 Customers Load Reduction Scatter Plot for ith\nHour During the DR event at Jun/22/2018 (17:00 - 19:00)\nand end times of each event. The detailed analysis results are shown in the Ap-\npendix.\n64\n3.3.3 One Demographic Factor Analysis for the Fourth Dataset\nOne demographic factor analysis has been done in the fourth dataset to reveal\nthe customers behavior considering different demographic factors. The same ap-\nproach is used for one demographic factor analysis. For each demographic factor\nanalysis, all of the customers who have the same demographic factors are used.\nThis analysis shows the impact of the household\u2019s income level and the number of\noccupants on customers\u2019 price responsiveness during DR events. The percentage\nof the average load reduction values is considered in this analysis.\nFigure 3.37: One Demographic Factor Analysis, Percentage Load Reduction\nResult: Income Level\nFig. 3.37 and Fig. 3.38 show all of the percentage of the load reduction results\nfor one demographic factor analysis in the fourth dataset. More detailed results\n65\nFigure 3.38: One Demographic Factor Analysis, Percentage Load Reduction\nResult: Number of Occupants\nare shown in the Appendix.\nFigure 3.39: One Demographic Factor Analysis, Average Percentage Load\nReduction Result: Income Level\n66\nFigure 3.40: One Demographic Factor Analysis, Average Percentage Load\nReduction Result: Number of Occupants\nFig. 3.39 and Fig. 3.40 exhibit the average percentage of load reduction results\nfor each income level and the number of occupants. The average percentage of\nload reduction is computed by calculating the average load reduction values for\neach demographic factor group overall 9 EDR periods. In Fig. 3.39, low-income\nand medium-income customers perform similarly during the DR events. More-\nover, high-income customers tend to provide more load reduction during the DR\nevents comparing with the other two groups. As can be seen in Fig. 3.40, the aver-\nage percentage of load reduction values are increasing as the number of occupants\nliving in the house is increasing.\n67\n3.4 Summary\nThe customers\u2019 behavior for different price plans and different demographic\nfactors during the on-peak period is presented in this chapter.\nThe results of the first and second dataset analyses show that the demographic\nfactors play an important role in customers\u2019 behavior, which is reflected by how\nmuch load reduction the customers in each category will provide. The impact\nof income level and if having child has been shown in the first round dataset. The\nhigh-income and medium-income level customers have relatively high load reduc-\ntion. One reason is that they may have more interruptable loads comparing with\nlow-income customers. If having child places an important role in high-income\nfamilies. Although it leads to higher daily electricity consumption, it also results\nin a larger load reduction during the on-peak period.\nThe impact of the number of occupants, livable space and start date has been\nexhibited in the third round analysis. For E21 customers, the more people that\nlive in the house, the more load reductions the household customers will tend to\nprovide. For both E21 and E26 customers, if the house is larger, the customers\nwill have a higher capability to reduce more load during the on-peak period. It\u2019s\nalso revealed that the start date of becoming customers is related to customers\u2019\nbehavior during the on-peak period. For E21 customers, the more experience and\nknowledge the customers have, the more rational choice the customers will make.\nHowever, for E26 low-income customers, this start date has the opposite effect.\n68\nThe new customers tend to provide more load reduction and old customers reduce\nless during the on-peak period. It is shown that more experience of their TOU plan\nmakes customers pay less attention to the on-peak load reduction.\nFor the fourth dataset analysis (emergency DR), high-income customers tend to\nprovide more load reduction during the DR events comparing with the other two\ngroups. Low-income and medium-income customers perform similarly during the\nDR events. The more people that live in the house, the more load reductions the\nhousehold customers will tend to provide.\nThe analysis results in this chapter will be further utilized in the distribution\ngrid operation optimization model. The customers will be divided based on their\ndemographic information. The price responsiveness of each demographic cate-\ngory will be represented by different Gaussian distributions. Monte Carlo Sim-\nulation (MCS) will be utilized to sample scenarios, which are used for chance-\nconstraint based SOCP-ACOPF, from these Gaussian distributions.\nThe next chapter will illustrate the chance-constraint based SOCP-ACOPF op-\ntimization model.\n69\nChapter 4\nCHANCE-CONSTRAINT BASED SOCP-ACOPF\nThe chance-constraint is utilized to handle the optimization model that has\nhigh uncertainty in its input data. In the distribution grid, the penetration of DERs\nis increasing dramatically nowadays. Due to the uncertainty of DERs, the opera-\ntion of the distribution system is facing huge challenges. In the distribution grid,\nif the operator chooses to use and rely on more energy coming from DERs, the\ndistribution system will face higher risk due to the characteristic of DERs, namely\nuncertainty and variability. However, chance-constraint can be powerful to over-\ncome uncertainty issues. For example, a violation threshold can be set to guarantee\nthat the solution of the model can have an acceptable risk level. By implementing\na chance-constraint, the operation of the distribution grid can be improved.\n4.1 Uncertainty of Customers\u2019 Price Responsiveness\nFrom chapter 3, the customers\u2019 behavior during the on-peak period for different\ndemographic categories is analyzed. The customers\u2019 price responsiveness can be\nrepresented as different Gaussian distributions.\nAn exemplary figure of the customers\u2019 price responsiveness for different time\nperiods, demographic categories and price plans is exhibited in Fig. 4.1. The five\ndifferent Gaussian distributions are the probability density function (PDF) of the\n70\nFigure 4.1: Customers\u2019 Price Responsiveness for Different Time Periods,\nDemographic Categories and Price Plans\ncustomer\u2019s price responsiveness. As can be seen from Fig. 4.1, for different elec-\ntricity price plans, different time periods, different demographic categories, the\ncustomer\u2019s electricity usage behavior is different. If we don\u2019t consider these dif-\nferences, but only use one Gaussian distribution to represent the price responsive-\nness of all customers at different time periods and different price plans, the green\ncurve in Fig. 4.1 is what we can obtain. Comparing with the other Gaussian dis-\ntributions in Fig. 4.1, the green curve has higher variance, which means higher\nuncertainty. This shows that analyzing customers\u2019 behavior based on time peri-\nods, demographic categories and price plans can reduce the uncertainty of DR,\nwhich will then improve the operation of the power system. The utility and opera-\ntor can also benefit from these analyzed customers\u2019 price responsiveness distribu-\n71\ntions. For example, they can call the customer groups, which have less uncertainty\nof customers\u2019 behavior, to reduce consumption. They can target customer groups\nthat have larger uncertainty of customers\u2019 behavior and provide less load reduc-\ntion in order to find the reasons why these happen.\nThe Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) is utilized to sample the scenarios from\nthese Gaussian distributions. However, due to the time limit, fake distributions are\nused in this chapter. In future work, the obtained customers\u2019 price responsiveness\ndistributions will be used for MCS scenarios sampling.\nThe following sections will illustrate chance-constraint SOCP-ACOPF.\n4.2 Flowchart of Chance-Constraint Based Model\nA flowchart of implementing chance-constraint in the optimization model is\nshown in Fig. 4.2. This algorithm borrows the idea of contingency analysis in the\npower system.\nFirstly, in the flowchart, second-order-cone-programming (SOCP) ACOPF is\nsolved by using Cplex in order to obtain the dispatch of the distribution system.\nThe uncertainty and variability of DERs are not considered in the first step. The ini-\ntial proportion of total DERs to total load Ipt % and I\nq\nt % are defined as the dispatch\nof the active and reactive power proportion of DERs without any uncertainty and\nvariability. They are calculated by the total dispatch of active and reactive power\nof DERs divided by the total load in the system. Secondly, the Monte Carlo Sim-\nulation (MCS) is used to generate scenarios. In this study, due to the time limit,\n72\nFigure 4.2: A Flowchart of Chance-constraint model\nfake distributions are utilized for MCS scenarios sampling. The outputs of six DR\nbuses are formed by six different distributions. For solar panel generation distri-\nbutions, two different weather conditions are considered, which are sunny and\ncloudy days. OpenDSS is a commercial software for simulating the distribution\ngrid. Power flow analyses are conducted by using MCS scenarios and OpenDSS.\nAfter solving the power flow, the bus voltage magnitudes, angles, and energy in-\njection from substation are obtained for each MCS scenario. Thirdly, the algorithm\nanalyzes the result of each scenario, if the scenario violates the threshold. The\npercentage of the number of violated scenarios zvio is calculated by the number of\n73\nviolated scenarios divided by the total number of scenarios. Fourthly, if the per-\ncentage of the number of violated scenarios zvio is greater than the violation pos-\nsibility \u03b5, the algorithm adjusts the proportion of DERs and retest the result using\nMCS scenarios. The violation possibility \u03b5 here is defined as either the possibil-\nity of the scenario violating the threshold or the risk of using energy coming from\nDERs. The threshold can be voltage deviation, power compensated from trans-\nmission grid and if violating line capacity. If zvio is greater than \u03b5, the coefficient \u03c4\nincreases. The coefficient \u03c4 is defined as the reduction of the initial active power\nproportion of total DERs to total load Ipt %. The coefficient \u03c4 is initialized to be 0,\nand the increased \u03c4 is put into modified SOCP-ACOPF. The active power propor-\ntion of total DERs to total load in the model is decreased by subtracting Ipt % by \u03c4 .\nSince if the active power proportion of total DERs to total load is decreased, the\nreactive power proportion of total DERs to total load will also need to decrease.\nNote that Iqt % may not be equal to I\np\nt %. In this chapter, due to the reactive pro-\nportion of DERs should be reduced in order to follow the decrease of the active\nproportion of DERs, the reactive proportion of DERs is decreased by ( I\np\nt %\u2212\u03c4\nIpt %\n)Iqt %.\nThe modified model is solved with less proportion of DERs and get dispatch of\nthe system. The new dispatch result and MCS scenarios are put in OpenDSS for\nsolving power flow analysis again. When the percentage of the number of violated\nscenarios zvio is smaller than violation possibility \u03b5, then the algorithm stops.\n74\n4.2.1 Second Order Cone Programming (SOCP) ACOPF\nFor the ACOPF model, the global optimal solution is hard to obtain due to\nthe non-linear and non-convexity of AC power flow equations. In this section, a\nSOCP-ACOPF model is introduced to guarantee the global optimal solution of the\nACOPF model.\nThe power flow equations are shown in (4.1)-(4.2), if Yi,k = Gi,k \u2212 jBi,k\nPi =\nN\u2211\nk=1\n|Vi||Vk|(Gi,k cos \u03b8i,k \u2212Bi,k sin \u03b8i,k) (4.1)\nQi =\nN\u2211\nk=1\n|Vi||Vk|(Gi,k sin \u03b8i,k +Bi,k cos \u03b8i,k) (4.2)\nIf there are only two buses, the power flow equations would be presented in\n(4.3)-(4.4) from bus i to bus j for time period t.\nP linei,j,t = Gi,jV\n2\ni,t +Gi,jVi,tVj,t cos \u03b8i,j,t \u2212Bi,jVi,tVj,t sin \u03b8i,j,t (4.3)\nQlinei,j,t = Bi,jV\n2\ni,t +Bi,jVi,tVj,t cos \u03b8i,j,t +Gi,jVi,tVj,t sin \u03b8i,j,t (4.4)\nIf we introduce auxiliary values (4.5)-(4.7) [51],\nUi,t =\nV 2i,t\u221a\n2\n(4.5)\nRi,j,t = \u2212Vi,tVj,t cos \u03b8i,j,t (4.6)\nIi,j,t = \u2212Vi,tVj,t sin \u03b8i,j,t (4.7)\nand substitute them into power flow equations (4.3)-(4.4).

It depends on residential customers\u2019 behavior. Three types of solar pan-\nels are considered. For PV type 1, the reactive power output can be controlled by\nits inverter. There is no control over the active power output. The output of the\nactive power of PV type 1 is always the maximum available active power capacity.\nFor PV type 2, it has no capability to provide reactive power support. The active\npower output can be controlled for PV type 2. For PV type 3, both active and reac-\ntive power can be controlled by its inverter. The charging rate, capacity limit, and\npower balance are considered in battery storage modeling.\nThe objective function of the SOCP-ACOPF model is minimizing the total sys-\n76\ntem cost.\nObjective function\nmin\n\u2211\nt\u2208T\n\u2211\n(g,n)\u2208GN\n\u03c1DAt P\ngrid\ng,n,t +\n\u2211\nt\u2208T\n\u2211\n(i,n)\u2208PV 1\n\u03c1Dt P\nPV 1\ni,n,t\n+\n\u2211\nt\u2208T\n\u2211\n(i,n)\u2208PV 2\n\u03c1Dt P\nPV 2\ni,n,t +\n\u2211\nt\u2208T\n\u2211\n(i,n)\u2208PV 3\n\u03c1Dt P\nPV 3\ni,n,t\n+\n\u2211\nt\u2208T\n\u2211\n(i,n)\u2208DR\n\u03c1Dt P\nDR\ni,n,t (4.13)\nConstraints\nP linei,j,t =\n\u221a\n2Gi,jUn,t \u2212Gi,jRi,j,t +Bi,jIi,j,t (i, j) \u2208 L, t \u2208 T, n \u2208 BUS (4.14)\nQlinei,j,t =\n\u221a\n2Bi,jUn,t \u2212Bi,jRi,j,t \u2212Gi,jIi,j,t (i, j) \u2208 L, t \u2208 T, n \u2208 BUS (4.15)\n2Ui,tUj,t \u2265 R2i,j,t + I2i,j,t (i, j) \u2208 L, t \u2208 T (4.16)\nRi,j,t = Ri,j,t (i, j) \u2208 L, t \u2208 T (4.17)\nIi,j,t = \u2212Ii,j,t (i, j) \u2208 L, t \u2208 T (4.18)\n\u2212 C linei,j \u2264 P linei,j,t \u2264 C linei,j (i, j) \u2208 L, t \u2208 T (4.19)\nGLg,n \u2264 P gridg,n,t \u2264 GHg,n (g, n) \u2208 GN, t \u2208 T (4.20)\nFLf,n \u2264 Qfactsf,n,t \u2264 FHf,n (f, n) \u2208 F, t \u2208 T (4.21)\nPDRi,n,t \u2264 DRmDPn,t (i, n) \u2208 DR, t \u2208 T (4.22)\nP PV 1i,n,t = C\npv1P\ni,n,t (i, n) \u2208 PV 1, t \u2208 T (4.23)\nQPV 1i,n,t \u2264\n\u221a\n(Cpv1Si,n,t )\n2 \u2212 (P PV 1i,n,t )2 (i, n) \u2208 PV 1, t \u2208 T (4.24)\n77\nP PV 2i,n,t \u2264 Cpv2Pi,n,t (i, n) \u2208 PV 2, t \u2208 T (4.25)\nP PV 3i,n,t \u2264 Cpv3Pi,n,t (i, n) \u2208 PV 3, t \u2208 T (4.26)\n(P PV 3i,n,t )\n2 + (QPV 3i,n,t )\n2 \u2264 (Cpv3Si,n,t )2 (i, n) \u2208 PV 3, t \u2208 T (4.27)\nSEi,n,t + P\nS\ni,n,t = \u03b1C\nS,H\ni,n (i, n) \u2208 SG, t = 1 (4.28)\nSEi,n,t + P\nS\ni,n,t = SEi,n,t\u22121 (i, n) \u2208 SG, t \u2208 T, t 6= 1 (4.29)\nRLi,n \u2264 P Si,n,t \u2264 RHi,n(i, n) \u2208 SG, t \u2208 T (4.30)\nCS,Li,n \u2264 SEi,n,t \u2264 CS,Hi,n (i, n) \u2208 SG, t \u2208 T, t 6= 1 (4.31)\n\u03b2CS,Hi,n \u2264 SEi,n,t \u2264 CS,Hi,n (i, n) \u2208 SG, t = 24 (4.32)\n\u2211\n(g,n)\u2208GN\nP gridg,n,t +\n\u2211\n(i,n)\u2208DR\nPDRi,n,t +\n\u2211\n(i,n)\u2208PV 1\nP PV 1i,n,t +\n\u2211\n(i,n)\u2208PV 2\nP PV 2i,n,t\n+\n\u2211\n(i,n)\u2208PV 3\nP PV 3i,n,t +\n\u2211\n(i,n)\u2208SG\nP Pi,n,t = D\nP\nn,t +\n\u2211\nj\u2208\u03c6n\nP linen,j,t t \u2208 T (4.33)\n\u2211\n(g,n)\u2208GN\nQgridg,n,t +\n\u2211\n(i,n)\u2208DR\nQDRi,n,t +\n\u2211\n(i,n)\u2208PV 1\nQPV 1i,n,t +\n\u2211\n(i,n)\u2208PV 3\nQPV 3i,n,t\n+\n\u2211\n(f,n)\u2208F\nQfactsi,n,t = D\nQ\nn,t +\n\u2211\nj\u2208\u03c6n\nQlinen,j,t t \u2208 T (4.34)\n0.92\u221a\n2\n\u2264 Un,t \u2264 1.1\n2\n\u221a\n2\nn \u2208 BUS, t \u2208 T, n 6= 1 (4.35)\nUn,t = 1 n = 1, t \u2208 T (4.36)\nThe constraints (4.14) and (4.15) are line flow from bus i to bus j for time period\nt, which are derived from SOCP convex strategy. (4.16)-(4.18) are cone constraints.\n78\nLine capacity limit constraint is given by (4.19) to guarantee that the line flow will\nnot exceed the line limit. The energy injection of substation and FACTS devices\nare limited by (4.20) and (4.21) due to the capacity of substation and FACTS are\nnot infinite. For DR modeling, if bus n can provide DR service, the maximum\nDR reduction is thirty percent of the load in bus n. The DR load reduction values\nfollow Gaussian distributions. Since the utility needs to ask the customers partici-\npating in DR programs, how much load reduction they are willing to provide for\na certain time period. In the SOCP-ACOPF, the dispatched DR reduction should\nbe less or equal to DRmDPn,t. The coefficient DRm is the maximum percentage of\nthe load reduction, which is set to 0.3. The DPn,t is the total active power demand in\nbus n. The constraints of PV type 1 are shown in (4.23) and (4.24). Reactive power\nis controlled by inverter (4.23) and active power is equal to the maximum capacity\n(4.24). The active control of PV type 2 constraint is presented in (4.25). The active\nand reactive controls of PV type 3 are introduced in (4.26) and (4.27). The battery\nstorage power balance constraints are (4.28) and (4.29). For the first period, we as-\nsume that there is stored energy in batteries, which is represented by the coefficient\n\u03b1 in (4.28). For the rest of the time period t, the stored and injecting energy should\nbe equal to the stored energy for the last time period t\u22121, which is shown in (4.29).\nThe minimum and maximum charging rates are shown in (4.30), which aims to re-\nstrict the battery storage energy injecting to the grid. Due to stored energy can not\nexceed the capacity of the battery storage, the battery storage constraints are listed\n79\nin (4.31) and (4.32). We assume that the stored energy cannot be zero for the last\ntime period, which is represented by the coefficient \u03b2 in (4.32). The node active\nand reactive power balancing constraints of the system are exhibited in (4.33) and\n(4.34). In order to keep voltage magnitude within reasonable range, voltage limit\nconstraints are shown in (4.35) and (4.36). Due to the substation is connected to\nbus 1, the voltage magnitude of bus 1 is equal to 1 p.u. for any period of time,\nwhich is represented in (4.36).\n4.2.2 Modified Second Order Cone Programming (SOCP) ACOPF\nIf the percentage of the number of violated scenarios zvio is greater than the vio-\nlation possibility \u03b5, the algorithm increases the \u03c4 , and then runs a modified SOCP-\nACOPF model for obtaining the dispatch of the distribution grid with less pro-\nportion of DERs. In order to reduce the proportion of DERs in the SOCP-ACOPF\nmodel, several adjustments are needed to implement.\nThe first adjustment is (4.37),\nP PV 1i,n,t =\nIpt %\u2212 \u03c4\nIpt %\nCpv1Pi,n,t (i, n) \u2208 PV 1, t \u2208 T (4.37)\nFrom constraint (4.23), the active power output of PV type 1 is equal to the max-\nimum available active power capacity. The available active power capacity of PV\ntype 1 should be shrunk, as the proportion of DERs is reduced by \u03c4 . If there is no\nIpt %\u2212\u03c4\nIpt %\nterm, P PV 1i,n,t will always be equal to C\npv1P\ni,n,t which is a fixed value.\nThe second and third adjustments are adding another two constraints (4.38)\n80\nand (4.39),\n\u2211\n(i,n)\u2208DR\nPDRi,n,t +\n\u2211\n(i,n)\u2208PV 1\nP PV 1i,n,t +\n\u2211\n(i,n)\u2208PV 2\nP PV 2i,n,t +\n\u2211\n(i,n)\u2208PV 3\nP PV 3i,n,t\n\u2264 (Ipt %\u2212 \u03c4)DPn,t t \u2208 T (4.38)\n\u2211\n(i,n)\u2208DR\nQDRi,n,t +\n\u2211\n(i,n)\u2208PV 1\nQPV 1i,n,t +\n\u2211\n(i,n)\u2208PV 3\nQPV 3i,n,t \u2264 (\nIpt %\u2212 \u03c4\nIpt %\n)Iqt %D\nQ\nn,t t \u2208 T\n(4.39)\nthe constraint (4.38) is added in order to limit the total active power output of\nDERs. The constraint (4.39) is appended to modified SOCP-ACOPF for restricting\nthe reactive power output of DERs, as the proportion of DERs to load is decreased.\nSince if the active power proportion of DERs is decreased, the reactive power pro-\nportion of DERs will also need to decrease. Note that Iqt % is not equal to I\np\nt %. The\nreactive proportion of DERs should be reduced to follow the decrease of the active\nproportion of DERs. In this chapter, the reactive proportion of DERs is decreased\nby ( I\np\nt %\u2212\u03c4\nIpt %\n)Iqt %.\nThe modified SOCP-ACOPF model includes the same objective function (4.13).\nThe constraints are (4.14)-(4.22), (4.37), (4.24)-(4.36) and (4.38)-(4.39).

In the distribution\nsystem, there are six buses that can provide DR service. There are five PV type 1,\nfive PV type 2 and five PV type 3. Because the inverter of PV type 1 can control\nthe reactive power and PV type 3 can control both active and reactive power, it is\nnot reasonable to sample active nor reactive power generation for PV type 1 and 3.\nIn this case, apparent power is sampled for the generation of PV types 1 and 3. In\neach MCS scenario, the values include six active power output of DR, five apparent\npower output of PV type 1, five active power output of PV type 2 and five apparent\npower output of PV type 3. These values are drawn from different Gaussian dis-\ntributions. Since the characteristics of residential customers\u2019 behavior towards DR\nbuses are different from each other, six different Gaussian distributions are used\nto sample DR reduction values. Due to PV generation is highly related to weather\nconditions, two different Gaussian distributions are utilized to simulate the power\n84\ngeneration of PV type 1, 2 and 3 under sunny and cloudy weather. The Gaus-\nsian distribution for sunny weather has lower forecasting deviation and smaller\nvariance. The Gaussian distribution for cloudy weather has higher forecasting de-\nviation and larger variance. In future work, all of the Gaussian distributions will\nbe obtained by using machine learning.\n4.2.4 Case Study\nIEEE 33 bus distribution system is used for the case study. The topology of the\nIEEE 33 bus is shown in Fig. 4.3.\nFigure 4.3: Topology of IEEE 33 Bus Distribution System\nThere are one substation and four feeders. All of four feeders are radial.\nThe DERs information is presented in Table 4.1. The table shows buses that are\nconnected with DR, PV types 1, 2 and 3, and battery.\n85\nTable 4.1: DERs Information\nDR PV1 PV2 PV3 Battery\nBus 7 2 9 2 2\nBus 8 6 15 18 6\nBus 24 12 21 22 12\nBus 25 18 25 25 29\nBus 30 29 33 33\nBus 32\nThe 13th time period from 12pm - 13pm is considered in this case study. For the\n13th time period, the wholesale electricity price is higher than DERs price, which\nmeans that if there is no uncertainty in DERs generation, DERs will provide as\nmuch energy as possible in this time period. Moreover, the sun radiance is strong\nduring the 13th time period, and the available capacity of PV types 1, 2 and 3 tends\nto be large.\n4.2.5 Voltage Deviation\nIn this case study, the voltage deviation from the dispatched voltage value\nis considered. The maximum percentage of the voltage deviation from the dis-\npatched voltage is defined in 4.40.\nIf there are N scenarios, the actual voltage V ai,j is smaller than the dispatch volt-\n86\nage VDis,\nV LD = max{\nVDis \u2212 V ai,j\nVDis\n\u00d7 100%, i \u2208 BUS, j \u2208 {1, 2, ..., N}} (4.40)\nThe case study is simulated using Python. The SOCP-ACOPF and modified\nSOCP-ACOPF optimization are solved by Cplex, and power flow analysis is solved\nby OpenDSS. The result of the case study is presented in Fig. 4.4.\nFigure 4.4: Voltage Deviation from the Expected Value for Different Proportion of\nDERs\nIn Fig. 4.4, The voltage deviation V LD is increasing as the proportion of DERs is\nincreased. This shows that if we reduce the proportion of DERs, the lower bound\nof voltage (lowest voltage) will be close to the dispatched value. Comparing with\nthe small proportion of DERs case, if we use more DERs, the lowest voltage value\nmay far away from the desired value. Since the dispatched voltage values are\nthe solutions coming from the SOCP-ACOPF model, greatly deviating from the\ndispatched values is not what operators expect. Due to the characteristic of one\n87\nsubstation distribution grid (voltage is going down from substation to the end),\nslightly increasing voltage will not harm the distribution grid, but improve the\npower quality of the system. Thus, the voltage deviation that actual voltage is\nsmaller than desired voltage is considered in this study.\nFigure 4.5: Number of Violated Scenarios: Voltage Deviation from the Expected\nValue for Different Proportion of DERs\nSince voltage values are not desired to greatly deviate from the dispatched\nvalue, the voltage deviation from the dispatched voltage can be considered as one\nchance-constraint criterion. We can set the voltage deviation smaller than a speci-\nfied threshold and run the algorithm iteration shown in Fig. 4.2. In each iteration,\nthe algorithm counts how many scenarios violate the voltage deviation threshold.\nA threshold of voltage deviation is set to be 1%. The number of violated scenarios\nis recorded for each different proportion of DERs if the voltage deviation of the\nscenario is greater than 1%. The result is shown in Fig. 4.5.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 4.5, the number of violated scenarios is decreasing, as\n88\nwe reduce the proportion of DERs. This means that the voltage will not be much\nlower than the dispatched voltage value if we reduce the proportion of DERs.\nWe can also set one probability violation \u03b5 to stop the algorithm and output the\nsolution from modified SOCP-ACOPF, when the probability of violation is smaller\nthan the probability violation \u03b5. The obtained solution can guarantee the possi-\nbility of voltage deviation is smaller than the determined value. The probability\nviolation \u03b5 can be considered as the risk that the operator prefers. If the probability\nviolation \u03b5 is set to be 5%, the relationship between voltage deviation thresholds\nand dispatched DERs is shown in Fig. 4.6.\nFigure 4.6: Sensitivity Analysis of Dispatched DERs for Different Voltage\nDeviation Threshold\nThe dispatched DERs is defined as the solution of modified SOCP-ACOPF sat-\nisfying the chance-constraint (4.41).\n89\nzvio \u2264 \u03b5 (4.41)\nFrom Fig. 4.6, the larger the voltage deviation threshold is, the more DERs\nenergy will be dispatched for a determined risk level value \u03b5. As can be seen, the\nsmall change of voltage deviation threshold has a large impact on the proportion\nof dispatched DERs.\n4.2.6 Energy Compensation from Transmission grid\nIn the case study, the energy that is compensated from the transmission grid\nis considered. The compensated energy is equal to the mismatch between the dis-\npatched and actual energy from the substation. The compensated can also be de-\nfined as the reserves that the distribution grid needs in the real-time operation\nfrom the transmission. The dispatched active and reactive power from substation\nare denoted as P gridDis and Q\ngrid\nDis . The actual active and reactive power from substa-\ntion are denoted as P gridi and Q\ngrid\ni .\nIf there areN scenarios, and the active and reactive power that are compensated\nfrom transmission grid P gridC and Q\ngrid\nC can be\nP gridC = max{P gridi \u2212 P gridDis , i \u2208 {1, 2, ..., N}} (4.42)\nQgridC = max{Qgridi \u2212QgridDis , i \u2208 {1, 2, ..., N} (4.43)\nThe percentage of active and reactive power that are compensated from trans-\n90\nmission grid P gridC,% and Q\ngrid\nC,% can be\nP gridC,% = max{\nP gridi \u2212 P gridDis\nP gridDis\n\u00d7 100%, i \u2208 {1, 2, ..., N}} (4.44)\nQgridC,% = max{\nQgridi \u2212QgridDis\nQgridDis\n\u00d7 100%, i \u2208 {1, 2, ..., N}} (4.45)\nThe case study results are shown in the Fig. 4.7 and 4.8.\nFigure 4.7: Active and Reactive Power Compensated from Transmission Grid for\nDifferent Proportion of DERs\nThe increasing proportion of DERs is corresponding to the increasing uncer-\ntainty and variability in the distribution grid. From Fig. 4.7 and 4.8, the active\nand reactive power compensated from the transmission grid are increasing, as the\nproportion of DERs is increased. This shows that due to the characteristic of DERs,\nnamely uncertainty and variability, the compensated energy from the transmis-\nsion grid is increasing if the uncertainty and variability in the distribution grid are\nincreased. The compensated energy from the transmission grid can also be consid-\nered as the backup from the transmission grid. The higher the uncertainty in the\n91\nFigure 4.8: Percentage of Active and Reactive Power Compensated from\nTransmission Grid for Different Proportion of DERs\ndistribution grid, the more backup from the transmission grid the substation will\ntend to require.\nSince the reserves from the transmission grid are sometimes limited, compen-\nsating lots of energy from the transmission grid may bring troubles to system oper-\nation and undermine the reliability of the system. Moreover, the real-time electric-\nity price is much higher than the day ahead wholesale price, purchasing too much\nenergy from the real-time market will seriously affect customers and the utility\u2019s\nbenefit. Requiring a large amount of backup from the transmission grid should be\navoided when dispatching the system. The compensated energy from the trans-\nmission grid constraint can be considered as one chance-constraint criterion. This\ncase study applies a similar idea as Fig. 4.5. A threshold for compensated energy\nis set to be 20%. If the percentage of the compensated energy from the transmis-\nsion grid in the scenario is greater than 20%, the scenario is defined as the violated\n92\nscenario. The algorithm records the number of scenarios violating the threshold\nfor different proportions of DERs. The result is exhibit in Fig. 4.9.\nFigure 4.9: Number of Violated Scenarios: Energy Compensated from the\nTransmission Grid for Different Proportion of DERs\nFig. 4.9 shows that the number of scenarios that violate the compensated en-\nergy threshold is increasing, as the proportion of DERs is increased. It can be seen\nthat the number of violated scenarios has increased dramatically after about 60%\nof proportion of DERs. Besides, the number of violated scenarios becomes zero, if\nthe proportion of DERs is less than around 48%. The result indicates that dispatch-\ning more DERs in the distribution grid enlarges the uncertainty of DERs, which\nresults in requiring more energy compensated from the transmission grid.\nA probability violation \u03b5 can be set to stop the algorithm when the number of\nviolated scenarios is lower than the determined value. The probability violation\n\u03b5 can be considered as the risk that the system will have when dispatching DERs.\nThe algorithm will output the solution that can guarantee that the possibility of vi-\n93\nolating the compensated energy threshold is less than the determined value. If the\nprobability violation \u03b5 is set to be 5%, the relationship between voltage deviation\nthresholds and dispatched DERs is shown in Fig. 4.10.\nFigure 4.10: Sensitivity Analysis of Dispatched DERs for Different Compensated\nEnergy Threshold\nFrom Fig. 4.10, the larger the compensated energy threshold is, the more DERs\nenergy will be dispatched. The results can also be translated as the more DERs\nwill be dispatched, if there are enough reverses provided from the transmission\ngrid for a determined risk level.\n4.2.7 Sensitivity Analysis of Probability Violation\nThe last study is the sensitivity analysis of probability violation. If the voltage\ndeviation threshold and the compensated energy threshold are set to be 1% and\n20%, respectively, the result is shown in Fig. 4.11.\nAs can be seen, the dispatched DERs energy is increasing as the violation prob-\n94\nFigure 4.11: Sensitivity Analysis of Dispatched DERs for Different Violation\nProbability Threshold\nability increases. The small violation probability value refers to a conservative\noperation strategy. The large violation probability value means an optimistic op-\neration strategy. Fig. 4.11 shows that the more conservative the operator is, the\nless DERs will be dispatched. When operating the distribution grid with DERs,\nconservative sometimes is related to higher system costs. The trade-off between\nsystem cost and risk can be further studied in the future.\n4.2.8 Summary\nChapter 4 illustrates one chance-constraint based SOCP-ACOPF. The SOCP-\nACOPF is a convex model, which means that the global optimal solution is guar-\nanteed. Monte Carlo Simulation is used to sample the scenarios. The case study\nresults show the impact of the determined threshold on the solution of dispatched\nDERs.\n95\nChapter 5\nFUTURE WORK\nMachine learning and chance-constraint based SOCP-ACOPF model will be the\nmain research direction for future work.\n5.1 Machine Learning\nThe machine learning integrating with customers\u2019 demographic information\ncan improve the representation of the uncertainty of DERs, which is already shown\nin chapter 3 and chapter 4. One powerful exemplary result figure is Fig. 4.1.\nSince demographic information can reduce the uncertainty of customers\u2019 price re-\nsponsiveness distribution, the socially-aware aggregation of DERs for operational\nscheduling should be studied by implementing different machine learning algo-\nrithms.\nCombining machine learning in the ACOPF model will be one of the impor-\ntant research direction in my future work. The accuracy of the trained model has\na direct impact on the uncertainty of DERs in the chance-constraint based SOCP-\nACOPF model. The higher the accuracy of the trained model, the less the uncer-\ntainty of DERs will have. The operation of the distribution grid can be greatly\nimproved if the uncertainty of DERs is reduced.\nForecasting the generation of DERs is a regression problem. There are many\n96\nwell-established machine learning algorithms for regression such as ridge regres-\nsion, LASSO, support vector regression, k-nearest neighbors, artificial neural net-\nwork and recurrent neural network.\nSince different types of DERs have different characteristics, it is very important\nto find the most appropriate machine learning algorithm for each type of DERs\ndata. Besides, after training the data using machine learning, providing the in-\nterpretation of why this machine learning algorithm performs best is another key\nresearch direction in my future work.\n5.2 Chance-constraint\nFor the chance-constraint based model, there are three primary categories of\nexisting methods.\n\u2022 Scenarios approach\n\u2022 Sample average approximation\n\u2022 Robust optimization based methods\nFor the scenarios approach method, multiple scenarios are used to estimate the\nchance-constraint based model. Scenarios approach method searches the feasible\nregion of all scenarios in order to find the optimal solution. Scenarios approach\nmethod can be implemented without any distribution assumption. It is a data-\ndriven based approach. However, the number of scenarios and the complexity of\nscenarios are highly related to the solution. More scenarios and larger complexity\n97\nof the scenarios result in a more conservative solution. If there are N scenarios\n{\u03bei}Ni=1, the scenarios approach method can be formulated in the following [52].\nmin\nx\ncTx (5.1)\ns.t. f(x, \u03bei) \u2264 0, ..., f(x, \u03beN) \u2264 0 (5.2)\nIn the distribution optimization model, due to the uncertainty and variability of\nDERs, scenarios approach method can be utilized to implement chance-constraint\non ACOPF. However, the number of scenarios and the complexity of scenarios\nrequire careful study.\nThe sample average approximation method is similar to what is applied in\nchapter 4. It utilizes empirical distribution to approximate the true distribution\nof the targeted problem, which can be formulated in the following [52].\nmin\nx\ncTx (5.3)\ns.t.\n1\nN\nN\u2211\ni=1\n[1{f(x, \u03be) > 0}] \u2264 \u03b5 (5.4)\nIn sample average approximation, empirical distribution is used to estimate the\npossibility of violation. It can be formulated as a mixed integer programming us-\n98\ning big-M.\nmin\nx,z\ncTx (5.5)\ns.t.f(x, \u03be1)\u2212Mz1 < 0 (5.6)\n...\nf(x, \u03beN)\u2212MzN < 0 (5.7)\n1\nN\nN\u2211\ni=1\nzi \u2264 \u03b5 (5.8)\nzi \u2208 {0, 1} (5.9)\nSample average approximation methods can be utilized to implement chance-\nconstraint for ACOPF in distribution gird. It is a data-driven method. Scenarios are\nneeded to generate. However, Big-M is generally weak formulation. This short-\ncoming requires more research study.\nRobust optimization related methods are searching for an optimal solution that\nis feasible under a predefined uncertainty set. If the predefined uncertainty set\nis defined to be U , uncertainties are represented by \u03be \u2208 U , the chance-constraint\nprogramming and its robust counterpart can be formulated in the following [52].\nmin\nx\ncTx (5.10)\ns.t. P\u03be(x\ni\n0 + \u03be\nTxi \u2264 0, i = 1, 2, ...) \u2265 1\u2212 \u000f (5.11)\nmin\nx\ncTx (5.12)\ns.t. xi0 + \u03be\nTxi \u2264 0 \u2200\u03be \u2208 U , i = 1, 2, .. (5.13)\n99\nDefining the uncertainty set is the most important part of using robust optimiza-\ntion. A properly defined uncertainty set makes problems tractable, and can also\nmake the solution neither too conservative nor too risky. However, the robust op-\ntimization always needs huge computation.\nIn the distribution grid, the uncertainty of DERs should be properly defined in\nthe uncertainty set, and the robust optimization should be appropriately formu-\nlated in the SOCP-ACOPF model.\nIn a distribution system, due to the characteristic of DERs, some of the con-\nstraints can be formulated as chance-constraints. For example, the voltage mag-\nnitude constraint can be converted into the possibility of voltage magnitude Vi\nviolating the system criteria should be less than determined violation possibility \u03b5.\nP(V L \u2264 Vi \u2264 V H , i \u2208 BUS) \u2264 1\u2212 \u03b5\nV L and V H are the bus voltage limits.\nThe line capacity limit constraint can be converted into the chance-constraint in\nthe following.\nP(\u2212C linei,j \u2264 P linei,j \u2264 C linei,j , (i, j) \u2208 L) \u2264 1\u2212 \u03b5\nThe transmission grid repurchasing constraint, which restricts the energy that\nis compensated from transmission grid, can be formulated into chance-constraint.\nP(Pact \u2212 Pdis \u2264 \u03b1Pdis) \u2264 1\u2212 \u03b5\nP(Qact \u2212Qdis \u2264 \u03b2Qdis) \u2264 1\u2212 \u03b5\n100\nThe dispatched active power and reactive power purchasing from the transmission\nare denoted as Pdis and Qdis. The actual active and reactive power consumption in\nthe distribution grid are denoted as Pact and Qact. Energy repurchasing threshold\nis denoted as \u03b1Pdis and \u03b2Qdis. The difference between the actual and dispatched\nenergy should be within determined threshold.\nSince compensated energy from the transmission grid can be considered as the\nreserves from the transmission grid, the chance-constraint can be also formulated\nin the following.\nP(Pgrid \u2264 P schedgrid +Rschedgrid ) \u2264 1\u2212 \u03b5\nP schedgrid and R\nsched\ngrid are the scheduled active power and scheduled available re-\nserves from the transmission grid. Pgrid is the actual active power injected from\nthe transmission grid. The actual injected active power from the transmission grid\nshould be smaller than the sum of the scheduled injected power and scheduled\nreserves.\nOther chance-constraints can also be considered in future work.\n101\nREFERENCES\n[1] G.

IntroductionElectricity Markets (EM) are complex environments that are constantly adapting to the needs ofsociety. The liberalization of its segments, namely the production, transport and distribution of energy,allows several improvements such as quality of service, reduced costs and stimulation of marketmodels\u2019 creation, which promote competitiveness [1,2]. As a result, EM behavior has become moreunpredictable and complex due to the large number of participating entities and possible interactionsbetween them.Currently, EM are facing a new paradigm shift following the large-scale integration of RenewableEnergy Sources (RES) [3,4]. The significant use of fossil resources for energy production is one of themajor concerns of today\u2019s society. Climate change, environmental impact and the scarcity of resourceshave led to the need for investment in RES, which, by reducing the emission of greenhouse gases,contributes to an increase in the quality of life and sustainable development [5]. The European Union(EU) has the target of 20-20-20 by 2020 [6,7], which establishes measures that contribute to the changeAppl. Sci. 2018, 8, 328; doi:10.3390/app8030328 www.mdpi.com/journal/applsciAppl. Sci. 2018, 8, 328 2 of 21of legislation in the energy sector. This program aims to achieve three goals: (i) 20% reduction inCO2 emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 levels; (ii) a 20% increase in energy efficiency; and (iii) 20%representation of RES in the energy consumption in the EU.The inclusion of RES in EM is a highly complex task. The network operator needs to balancesupply and demand in order to maximize the available resources [8]. Due to the unpredictability of thebehavior of RES, this balance is difficult to achieve. Thus, a careful analysis of the behavior of marketentities, namely the consumption and production profiles, is required in real time.The large-scale implementation of Distributed Generation (DG) plays a key role in energymanagement and is associated with the concepts of the Smart Grid (SG) [9], microgrid [10],microgeneration [11], prosumer [12], community microgrids [13], virtual power plants [14], integratedcommunity energy systems [15] and Demand Response (DR) [16]. The DG consists of the decentralizedproduction of energy, which acts at the level of consumers. These can produce energy from RES andsell it to the grid. Thus, the consumer goes by the name of prosumer [17], which is a combination ofconsumer and producer. In DG systems, prosumers aggregate into small networks (microgrids) inorder to facilitate energy scheduling within a smaller geographic area. According to Georgilakis in [18],\u201cDGs contribute in the application of competitive energy policies, diversification of energy resources,reduction of on-peak operating cost, deferral of network upgrades, lower losses, lower transmission,distribution costs, and potential increase of service quality to the end-customers\u201d.In order to enable large-scale penetration of DG, it is necessary to upgrade energy transmissionnetworks so that they have mechanisms that are capable of dealing with the unpredictability of RESand adjusting to the energy needs of the consumer. SGs respond to these needs, being equipped withubiquitous technology that allows the control, processing and automation of the energy supply [4].In addition, the installed sensors along the network allow the collection of a great diversity andquantity of data. These data can be used to feed simulators that provide decision support to EMentities, through artificial intelligence techniques, as a way of dealing with their increasing complexity.There is a number of benefits that the system operator can obtain from using simulated scenarios:discover failures in power supply and study solutions to make the network more efficient, reliableand secure; study and delineate the behavioral profiles of their users, so as to be able to forecastconsumption and implement appropriate DR programs; design and test new market models so thatEM can adapt to the new needs of their consumers; among others. On the other hand, the consumerscan also obtain several advantages, such as visualization of their consumption profile, responding tothe incentives of the EM in order to increase their profit (DR), charging, etc. Thus, the information flowin the grid becomes bidirectional, where the consumer is also able to react to changes in the grid [19].For entities involved in power and energy systems to be able to cope with the changing andgrowing complexity of wholesale and retail markets, as well as the consequences of DG penetration,several simulation tools have emerged, allowing the study of the various concepts and their evolution(examples are presented in Section 2). However, these tools have the disadvantage of only solvingproblems in specific fields, and therefore, they are not able to provide a more comprehensive studyinvolving several domains. Thus arises the need to create solutions to perform more comprehensivestudies through the interconnection of the different areas of simulation tools. However, this isa complex task, since it is necessary to create communication mechanisms between systems thathave heterogeneous characteristics, such as the programming language in which they are developed,the different time resolutions, the handling of events and the synchronization of processes, amongseveral other critical aspects, as discussed in Section 2.This paper proposes the Tools Control Center (TOOCC) framework, which has the objective ofincreasing the interoperability between heterogeneous agent-based systems for the simulation andstudy of power and energy systems\u2019 concepts, such as EM, SG operation, energy management andparticipant entities. TOOCC acts as a facilitator in the interaction between entities/agents with distinctnatures, through the use of ontologies, which allow the sharing of a vocabulary to ensure that allsystems understand concepts equally. The framework also aims to achieve more complete simulationsAppl. Sci. 2018, 8, 328 3 of 21with different time resolutions (e.g., real-time simulation, wholesale market, etc.) in a more automatedway and provides relevant information about the results to the user.After this introductory section, Section 2 presents an overview of related work in the fieldsof agent-based simulation in power and energy systems, decision support systems in this domainand on interoperability between systems. Section 3 addresses the characteristics, advantages, phasesand also the multi-agent architecture of TOOCC framework. A case study is presented in Section 4,which illustrates how the interaction between the systems is made and also an example of the kind ofresults the user can analyze. Finally, Section 5 presents the most relevant conclusions and contributionsof this work.2. Power and Energy Systems SimulationDecision Support Systems (DSS) are widely used in very different applications such ase-commerce [20], bank clients\u2019 management [21], pricing negotiation [22], etc. Power and energysystems\u2019 decision support through simulation is increasingly gaining visibility due to the highuncertainty surrounding this field. Thus, DSSs have several advantages in the study of this field:understanding how different market mechanisms can affect sellers and buyers of energy; makinga forecast of the network\u2019s consumption for a certain instant, to understand the appropriate schedulingof energy; exploring new possibilities for alternative market models; deepening the understandingof how DR will affect consumers; what DR tariffs are most appropriate for certain consumer profiles;network planning, etc.It is increasingly common to design energy and power systems under a multi-agent architecture,because their distributed nature allows them to deal with the complexity of the system [23]. In addition,each agent can represent an entity with its own desires, constraints, autonomy and flexibility. This way,an agent can represent a market participant, a network component or a system. On the other hand,the simulation allows the study of future changes to the real systems and their behavior, reducing thecosts and time needed to perform upgrades. Some examples of multi-agent simulators developed tostudy this field are:\u2022 The Electricity Market Complex Adaptive System (EMCAS) [24]: developed to model theEM, enabling the investigation of the physical infrastructure and the economic behavior ofmarket participants;\u2022 The Agent-based Modeling of Electricity Systems (AMES) [25]: allows the study of wholesale EMoperation and their participants\u2019 strategies over the time;\u2022 The Multi-Agent Negotiation and Risk Management in Electricity Markets (MAN-REM) [26]:devoted to risk management in EM\u2019s bilateral contracting;\u2022 The simulation of power generation company\u2019s behavior in electricity markets [27]:investigates the strategic behavior of power generation companies under different market-clearingmechanisms;\u2022 The Multi-Agent Smart Grid Simulation Platform (MASGriP) [28]: designed to consider realcharacteristics and goals of consumers, producers, prosumers and Virtual Power Players(aggregators of small players) in SG and to allow the integration with the Multi-Agent Simulatorfor Competitive Electricity Markets (MASCEM);\u2022 The Power Trading Agent Competition (Power TAC) [29]: is a competition from the perspective ofbrokers (energy retailers, commercial or municipal utilities, or cooperatives) in order to simulatefuture models and market dynamics;\u2022 Smart Grids Information and Communication (SGiC) [30]: incorporates different incentiveprograms such as VPP and DR, provides support to customers and enables power routingand balancing;Appl. Sci. 2018, 8, 328 4 of 21\u2022 Building performance simulation [31]: uses regression surrogate models to simulate energy usageprofiles of the building\u2019s occupants and facility managers, estimate energy consumption and helpquantify the impact of uncertainty, in human actions on the performance of the built environment;\u2022 Simulation of electricity consumption of an office room [32]: considers different factors of impacton energy saving;\u2022 Cooperative control of energy storage units in the microgrid [33]: manages the charging/dischargingbehavior of multiple storage units;\u2022 Simulation of electric vehicle driver behavior in road transport and electric power networks [34]:developed to fully understand the consequences of electrical vehicles\u2019 integration, the behavior ofthe drivers and its impact on road transport and electric power networks;\u2022 Others.In addition, there are several other solutions and simulators developed with the objective ofstudying power and energy systems (e.g., The Power Systems Simulator [35]; the Hybrid Optimizationof Multiple Energy Resources [36,37]; Eurostag [38,39]; OMNeT++ [40]; the GridLAB-D [41];the MOCES [42]; the GridSim [43]; the DRSim [44]; among others), or other works that can be appliedto the context of energy systems such as [45,46]. Section 3.1 provides a more detailed description ofsome more simulators with which the proposed tool interacts.2.1. Simulation of Heterogeneous SystemsIn the literature, it is possible to find only a few solutions capable of enabling heterogeneoussystems\u2019 interoperability, in the area of power and energy systems. For instance, the Electric Powerand Communication Synchronizing Simulator (EPOCHS) [47] is a pioneering MAS that combines theresults of several simulators by using realistic scenarios, to solve network communication problems inthe laboratory, avoiding potential costs and damages. Another similar tool is the Global Event-DrivenCo-Simulation framework (GECO) [48], which aims to model and simulate the monitoring, protectionand control schemes of the power systems and communication network. For these two tools, althoughthey allow the co-simulation of several tools, their area of operation is restricted to power systems andcommunication network. The Mosaik system [49,50] aims to allow the simulation of heterogeneouscomponents of the SG, providing different models that allow one to simulate producers, consumers,prosumers, electric vehicles and other elements of the network. This system addresses many of thechallenges of interoperability in the area and has a similar proposal to TOOCC. However, similarlyto the previous tools, it also does not have an extended domain as is desired, since it focuses on thesimulation of scenarios related to SG. Furthermore, according to the authors\u2019 understanding, Mosaikis only able to perform static simulations, which were previously configured and programmed. If it isintended to add a new system to the simulation, it must be restructured, and it is necessary to carryout new configuration programming work.Although there are several MAS dedicated to the study of the energy sector, they are orientedtowards solving problems in specific domains, for private use, limited to systems already incorporated(do not allow the connection to external systems), do not take advantage of the formal exchange ofknowledge, or only support interoperability in already configured static simulations. When thesesystems are able to communicate with each other and to exchange knowledge, by combining theirindividual capacities, it is possible to solve problems that cover more comprehensive and complexdomains in a more flexible way. Thus, the interoperability between systems allows the simulation ofscenarios that support the growing complexity of this area, where its stakeholders are in a constantprocess of interaction and negotiation with each other, and there is a need for careful management ofresources. The multi-agent technology has particularities that facilitate the increase of interoperabilitybetween systems [51]. However, the interoperability among systems is highly complex due to theirheterogeneity. Since they are distinct tools, they may also have different domains, concept definitions,programming languages, temporal resolutions, event handling and others. It is necessary to establishAppl. Sci. 2018, 8, 328 5 of 21a mechanism for communication between these systems, which initially would be incompatible.For MAS to be able to communicate with each other in order to overcome their individual limitations,it is necessary to use mechanisms that allow the sharing of information and knowledge that at thesame time provides the necessary flexibility to deal with the execution of several processes at the sametime. For this purpose, standard communication formats and protocols must exist, which ensure thatthe involved entities assign the same meaning to different terms [52,53].2.2. Ontologies for Semantic InteroperabilityIn [54], it is mentioned that an \u201cOntology provides a shared vocabulary, which can be usedto model a domain that is, the type of objects, and/or concepts that exist, and their properties andrelation\u201d. In the energy field, several ontologies have been developed for SG and EM. In [55,56]ontologies are used with the main goal of supporting energy management for end consumers, in themicrogrid context. The ontology described in [19] aims at the interaction between building energymanagement and smart grids. In [57] some of the most relevant standards are combined in a newsolution. A middleware to represent the power grid components is presented in [58]. And [59] providesan ontology based on Greek EM and adapted to the EU directives.The Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA) [60] is an IEEE Computer Society standardof communication used for the development of MAS. With the use of this standard, it is intendedto guarantee: agent life cycle management, message transport and structure, interaction protocols,ontologies and security. The messages are built under the Agent Communication Language (ACL)structure, which allows the definition of various elements (e.g., performative, sender, receiver, content,language and ontology, among others) and various communicative acts (e.g., agree, cancel, confirm,not-understood, etc.). The content of the message can be in any format, being adaptable to any ontology.3. TOOCCTOOCC is a multi-agent DSS developed with the purpose of creating, simulating and analyzingcomplex EM scenarios, by enabling interoperability between heterogeneous simulation tools.These scenarios may cover the use of several different systems or services simultaneously, or theindependent use of each. The proposed system also allows one to define the necessary models andinputs for each of the scenarios and executes them in different machines of the domain, movingbetween them according to the needs of certain software.This DSS is a multi-faceted tool that intends to support several entities of the power and energysystem (network operator, consumers, producers, aggregators, etc.), taking into account different timehorizons, from a proactive perspective. TOOCC can, for instance, be used to make future projectionsfor a network or to schedule the energy of a house for the next hour, respecting certain restrictions.Moreover, in certain systems, this tool considers the introduction of system failures, to study theirimpact in a simulation.This framework is developed in JAVA language and uses the JADE platform to implement itsagents, which is FIPA compliant. In addition, to achieve interoperability between systems, TOOCCuses ontologies that allow the sharing of vocabulary and mapping of concepts between systems, so thatthey can communicate. The ontologies are formulated in OWL DL, with representation in RDF/XML(more details in Section 3.3).The integration of TOOCC with other simulation tools has the following objectives:\u2022 Interoperability: The strategic union of the individual capacities of each tool allows one to extendthe domain of knowledge and to simulate problems with more coverage. Thus, more complexscenarios are executed, which allows higher quality results.\u2022 Flexibility: In order to be able to execute scenarios with different characteristics, a high degreeof flexibility is necessary in the definition of scenarios, since there is a large number of possiblecombinations in the relationships between systems and services.Appl. Sci. 2018, 8, 328 6 of 21\u2022 Realism: The addition of real data in the creation of scenarios originates results that are closer toreality. These data can be represented in models used by the tools or, for instance, as historicaldata to be used in forecasts.\u2022 Graphical interface: Many of the mentioned tools do not have a graphical interface that facilitatestheir interaction with the user. TOOCC has an interface that allows the user to follow the executionof all the tools with which it is integrated.\u2022 Centralized management: From a single tool, it is possible to go through all the stages of the tools,namely in the configuration, simulation and analysis of the scenarios\u2019 results. Thus, the user doesnot need to worry about guaranteeing the execution of several tools, since this management isdone by TOOCC.\u2022 Results analysis: By providing some possible conclusions of the simulated scenarios, it is intendedto give decision support to its user. For this, TOOCC establishes a direct comparison betweenthe results of different scenarios and presents that information through the production of tables,graphs and files with output data with specific information.\u2022 Automation: One of the main goals is to simplify the process of creating the scenarios, automatingit as much as possible. In this way, TOOCC provides several alternatives to fill the models andinputs needed to run the tools, saving the user a lot of time. When the configuration processis complete, the simulation and results\u2019 generation are completely automatic and autonomous.This allows the user to save much time.\u2022 Error reduction: Although it is possible to integrate these systems manually\u2014to run iterativelyand alternately each of the systems and to constantly adjust their configurations, inputs andmodels\u2014this is a process that can easily introduce errors, given that it requires much attentionand user interaction. The usage of TOOCC simplifies and automates the process, so it reducespossible human errors.Figure 1 shows a general perspective of TOOCC\u2019s flow. For the creation of scenarios, the frameworkreceives information from stored models, as well as the input of required data to perform itsconfiguration. This input can be fed by real data, giving a more realistic character to the wholesimulation. The user can define scenarios as desired, and these can run one or more systems/servicesprovided by other multi-agent systems, depending on the scenario\u2019s complexity. If the user wishes,he/she can also manipulate these predefined models and adapt them according to his/her desire.If more than one scenario is run, and the simulation results are equivalent, it is possible to comparethem automatically. In the end, all the results and configured comparisons will be presented to theuser so that conclusions can be drawn about the studies or best decisions to be made by the user.3.1. Systems and ServicesThere are two types of entities that can be part of a scenario: systems and services. Systems aremore complete MAS or agents, with their own simulation and intelligence capabilities. The services,although they can be made available by a MAS, are characterized by their simplicity. Usually, these arealgorithms that provide support in performing other big tasks. There is a wide variety of tools andalgorithms already available to TOOCC, namely Multi-Agent Simulator for Competitive ElectricityMarkets (MASCEM) [61], Adaptive Decision Support for Electricity Market Negotiation (AiD-EM) [62],Intelligence and Decision Support multi-agent system (IDeS) [63] and PLCMAS (Programmable LogicController Multi-Agent System) [63]. These tools were all developed within GECAD research group.The main objective of MASCEM is the simulation of scenarios with the purpose of studying thebehavior of EM and their entities. For this, the simulator has implemented the rules and characteristicsof the three main European energy markets: MIBEL(Iberian Peninsula) [64], EPEX(central Europe) [65]and NordPool (northern Europe) [66]. In addition, the simulator also allows the participation in eachof its market types, which vary in restrictions and time perspectives, namely day-ahead spot market,balancing market, intra-day market, bilateral contracts and forward contracts. On the other hand,Appl. Sci. 2018, 8, 328 7 of 21it is also possible to model the characteristics, desires and behavior of the entities that constitute to themarket (e.g., consumer, producer, prosumer, aggregators, market operator and system operator).In order to adequately represent the complexity and dynamism of the interaction between theparticipating entities in EM, the simulator is designed under a multi-agent architecture, which uses theJADE platform.Figure 1. Tools Control Center\u2019s (TOOCC) general overview. MASCEM, Multi-Agent Simulator forCompetitive Electricity Markets; AiD-EM, Adaptive Decision Support for Electricity Market Negotiation;IDeS, Intelligence and Decision Support multi-agent system; PLCMAS, Programmable Logic ControllerMulti-Agent System.AiD-EM is a multi-agent tool that provides decision support to players who wish to participate inthe EM. This system uses artificial intelligence techniques to determine which are the best proposals inthe market, depending on the purpose of the player. The simulator has several subsystems, with specificroles. For example, the Adaptive Learning Strategic Bidding System (ALBidS) [67] aims to providestrategic support in auctioned markets, while the Decision Support for Energy Contracts Negotiation(DECON) [68] is designed to support the direct contract of energy between entities. AiD-EM allowsone to deal with different user profiles and adopt the strategies most appropriate for each opponent.This tool can work directly with the MASCEM simulator, where market entities choose to use the AiD-EMdecision support system, and like the simulator, it also uses the JADE platform for agent development.The PLCMAS tool allows one to test the scenarios in a real environment, being able to apply theresults to physical devices, making them act accordingly. These devices are essentially lights, socketsand HVAC and need to be connected to a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC).The IDeS system provides several services to external systems, namely: forecast algorithms(i.e., artificial neural networks, support vector machines and fuzzy inference systems), DR programs,energy resource management systems at the house, SG and microgrid levels, among others. Most ofthe services provided in TOOCC belong to this tool.3.2. Inputs and ModelsTo run all systems/services, it is necessary to provide specific input data to each of them, to makethe proper configuration. The input, in addition to configuration parameters, may also include models,simulated data and real data. For this purpose, there are two possible sources: (i) a database where theAppl. Sci. 2018, 8, 328 8 of 21real data and models are stored; or (ii) by reading files with a specific structure. Regarding the real data,these refer to consumption data (HVAC, lights and sockets), meteorological conditions, production(solar and wind generation) and energy transactions related to several EM.The designed models are the result of a study of the necessary requirements to model SG and EMand have already been tested several times in different types of problems. These includes large-scaleshort and real-time resource optimization; components of SGs (generators, storage units, loads andelectric vehicles); DR tariffs that allow one to manage the flexibility of energy consumption; energyconsumption tariffs for the United States of America, Brazil and several countries of the EU; aggregationmodels of players; players trading profiles; market proposals; among others. The wide variety ofmodels offered by TOOCC, combined with the mentioned tools, allow the specification of verydiversified scenarios, particularly in the context in which it is inserted, with its particular characteristicsand objectives. In addition, it is also possible to carry out studies on the impact of these models ina given context.Depending on the systems or algorithms involved in the simulation, the temporal resolution ofthe simulation will also be different. For example, TOOCC can process a real-time simulation and acton the physical devices of a building, simulate the operation of the EM where it is necessary to wait forthe registration of the bids or make a consumption forecast, which has no time constraints with whichto comply.3.3. Simulation and InteroperabilityIn order to allow interoperability between the multi-agent tools presented in Section 3.1,ontologies are used in the simulation phase, enabling them to speak the same language and tounderstand the same concepts and terms, preventing different interpretations of the same information.The use of ontologies also facilitates the execution of scenarios, especially in those that use differenttools. Within this work, we can find two types of ontologies. The first type is conceptual ontologies,which are the basis for communication between systems. These ontologies allow the descriptionof the vocabulary that will be shared between the systems, from measures (e.g., energy ontology,temperature ontology, etc.), to more complex concepts such as load flexibility in DR (e.g., load flexibilityontology) and power management (e.g., scheduling, optimization and forecasting ontology). AlthoughTOOCC uses these ontologies to establish communication with other systems, they are developedindependently of the TOOCC and are already publicly available in [69]. The second type of ontologyis related to the procedural part of the systems (application ontology), and it is used in the system\u2019sregistration phase to describe the way the systems work, namely by the description of its services andpossible communications, detailing inputs and outputs.Currently, for TOOCC to be able to communicate with a new system, it is necessary that it usesthe mentioned ontologies in its communications. First, the new system must be able to communicatewith the TOOCC\u2019s application ontology to be incorporated into the system. Through this ontology,the TOOCC is able to automatically generate the necessary structures for the configuration of the newsystem simulation. Subsequently, the new system should also incorporate the conceptual ontologies inorder to be understood by TOOCC. For this purpose, the system can internally use the same ontologiesor make the appropriate mapping from the ontologies to its own model. In the future, to help theintegration of external systems, the development of a library is intended that allows the automaticconversion of the data structures in the respective ontologies. Moreover, using the semantic modelinstead of converting to classes/structures makes it possible to change the model without the need toreprogram code, which can be an advantage to adapt the model by the external systems\u2019 developers.During the simulation, the external systems will be constantly sending messages that mustbe interpreted by TOOCC. These messages may signal a request to run another system (alreadyconfigured in the simulation preparation phase) or the arrival of the results of an earlier request.For this purpose, the tool has a message server that is constantly listening to new messages, and whena new message arrives at the system, it is in charge of triggering the event (behavior) that will treat it.Appl. Sci. 2018, 8, 328 9 of 21This event, through analysis of the simulation configuration, knows the next steps of the simulationand, if necessary, generates new events in order to follow the simulation.Figure 2 presents the TOOCC multi-agent perspective. The agents are organized hierarchically,and each one contributes to the resolution of part of the problem, by sharing vocabulary resultingfrom the combination of several ontologies, as illustrated in the figure. TOOCC contains the followingagent types:\u2022 TOOCC agent: This is the main agent of TOOCC and is responsible for launching and managingthe GUI component. In addition, when the user initiates the simulation, this agent creates newagents, intended to execute each scenario. This agent is unique in the system, and the user willalways interact with it.\u2022 Scenario agent: This is used to manage the scenario for which it was created. This agent verifiesthat the systems, to which it needs to connect, are alive, and if they are, it sends the necessaryinput data to their execution and orders the start of simulation. Several scenario agents can beexecuted at the same time.\u2022 System agent: This allows one to establish communication between specific services from thesystems, instead of whole systems, mapping information between them. This agent can assumespecific characteristics depending on the system with which it will interact.Figure 2. TOOCC\u2019s multi-agent perspective. SHIM, SCADA House Intelligent Management.3.4. Results Comparison and AnalysisThe component of analysis and the comparison of results allow one to demonstrate to the userthe results of the scenarios\u2019 execution. These results can be visualized through graphs, tables andoutput files specially designed for this purpose. In addition to visualizing the results, it is also possibleto establish comparisons between them. This mechanism allows the user to draw quick conclusionsabout the problem and to produce auxiliary tools to aid in decision support.The comparison of the results is also achieved using ontologies. Because ontologies allow systemsto know the same vocabulary and concepts, it is possible to automatically detect the output data of thesame or comparable type and make that information available to the user.4. Case StudyAs already mentioned, the DG raises several challenges in energy management. The networkoperator must have great flexibility and control over the electricity consumption and production,in order to avoid the waste of energy and to minimize costs.The following case study aims to illustrate the TOOCC simulation process, demonstrating someof its advantages by giving decision support to entities of different levels of energy management.To do this, the study consists of a co-simulation involving several systems. The first step refersAppl. Sci. 2018, 8, 328 10 of 21to the energy scheduling in a microgrid, from a general perspective provided by the networkoperator. Afterwards a local perspective provided by each load belonging to the same microgrid isconsidered, namely to assess the impact of the microgrid management on the individual consumers.A specific individual consumer emulated physically in the GECAD building lab is analyzed,using a home energy management system, SCADA House Intelligent Management (SHIM), to managethe consumption resources of this building while respecting the energy scheduling imposed by theNetwork Manager (NM).In Section 4.1, it is possible to find more details about the network\u2019s constitution and the load thatwill exemplify the local process. Section 4.2 explains how TOOCC is used to simulate the describedscenario. For this purpose, the integration of several systems is made to match their results and achievethe most complete, robust and reliable result, namely NM, Facility Manager (FM), IDeS and PLCMAS.Finally, Section 4.3 presents the results of the performed simulation.4.1. SpecificationsThe considered simulation scenario is composed of a small voltage network of an existinguniversity campus in Portugal, represented in Figure 3. The considered microgrid has 21 buses,20 loads, 20 photovoltaic systems, 4 wind generators, 7 storage systems, 2 capacitors, 300 electricalvehicles and 1 external supplier. In addition, this is a future scenario, relative to a typical day of thewinter of 2050, based on a study presented in [70]. For demonstration purposes, this study containsthe results of the network manager and only one of the loads.Figure 3. Case study Low Voltage distribution network. Image adapted from [70].Appl. Sci. 2018, 8, 328 11 of 21The reference load in this study is Load 15. It is, in reality, a laboratory that aims to simulate theenergy consumption of a house, illustrated in Figure 4, by monitoring the usage of several appliancesand loads, namely HVAC, lights and sockets, among others. The simulated smart house has a bedroom,a hall, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room. The remaining loads are simulated through agents,which use historical data of the energy consumption of the respective buildings of the campus.Figure 4. Simulated house composition.4.2. TOOCC PerspectiveIn order to simulate the current scenario, TOOCC needs to configure it. This tool allowsthe same scenario to be modeled in different ways, reconfiguring the interaction between thepreviously-presented systems, in a rather automatic process. In this case, the simulation will integratethe IDeS and PLCMAS systems, with two agents, namely an NM agent (network operator) and an FMagent (Load 15).Figure 5 illustrates the interaction between the four different systems and demonstrateshow the concepts of the ontologies presented in Section 3.3 are shared between the systems.The communications shown in this figure represent specific interactions between some of the mostrelevant agents, which are accomplished by a direct use of the considered ontologies. It shows that theinitialization of the NM\u2019s scheduling requires the reception of the forecasts from all grid loads/FMs.The forecasts of each load include information on the consumption, production, characteristics andstate of the facility\u2019s resources (e.g., sockets, lights, PV generation, etc.). The scenario considersone FM per consumer of the considered microgrid, which is responsible, in this stage, to send thespecific consumption and generation forecasts to the NM. FM gets its forecasts by interacting withthe IDeS system, which is responsible for executing the forecast algorithm, based on the history of itsconsumption and power production.Appl. Sci. 2018, 8, 328 12 of 21Figure 5. Simplified sequence diagram of TOOCC\u2019s interaction with external systems. ERM, EnergyResources Management system.Figure 6 illustrates the forecasts of energy, relative to consumption and distributed production(solar and wind) for the whole microgrid, for the following day. As can be observed, the productionpeak occurs between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., where the highest incidence of sunlight is verified, reachingthe value of approximately 585 kW. During the night periods, production comes from wind generators.Comparing 1 a.m. and 10 p.m., for instance, it is possible to verify a great difference in the production ofenergy, due to changes in the state of the wind. As for consumption, between 10 a.m. and 10 p.m. thereis a high energy consumption. Since the microgrid is relative to a university campus, this consumptioncorresponds to the period of classes. The peak consumption is around 11 p.m., reaching about 518 kW.This happens because there is a transition of classes between morning and afternoon, which sums moreconsumption. The classes of the night have less students, which explains the smaller consumption.As soon as the FM agent receives all the forecasts, it sends them to TOOCC, which in turn routesthem to NM. At this point, the simulation already meets the necessary conditions to carry out the nextstep, that is to obtain the energy scheduling of the microgrid for the next day.The next step is to start the scheduling of the energy by the NM agent. For this purpose, the NMuses the Energy Resources Management (ERM) [71] system, provided by IDeS, which executes inthree stages: scheduling day-ahead, hour-ahead and real-time. The first stage is for the networkoperator to perform the energy management for the next day, taking into account forecasts of allloads. The second phase (our-ahead scheduling) is analogous to the previous phase, but it usesup-to-date forecasts, with one hour of delay of the desired moment, guaranteeing a smaller error.The third phase, corresponding to the real-time scheduling, is the same process, but for the nextfive minutes. This three-phase approach allows the network operator to have a forecast of howAppl. Sci. 2018, 8, 328 13 of 21the power consumption will be across the network, and the DG available to meet the demand forthe next day. As the DG comes from volatile sources, it is important that the NM can adjust itselfover time, using up-to-date forecasts, as the estimated value tends to be closer to reality. In thisway, energy wastage is avoided, as well as power supply failure. In this case study, the forecastsare exchanged between FM and NM through TOOCC, which acts as an intermediary between thetwo systems.Figure 6. Power demand and distributed generation forecast, for each hour of the day.Once the real-time scheduling results are obtained, they must be sent to the FM, i.e., Load 15of the network, so that it can perform the forward local scheduling of energy. Once again, TOOCChas the role of receiving real-time results and forwards them to FM. The FM sends a request for theSCADA House Intelligent Management (SHIM) [72] platform, the execution of which is secured by theIDeS system. This platform is able to perform the local residential energy scheduling, considering thedemands and restrictions of the NM.At this point, in real-time, Load 15 is able to use the results obtained from its own energymanagement, by acting directly on its physical devices. In order to do this, the FM sends the resultsto TOOCC, so that it can order the PLCMAS system to implement the necessary changes, once it isconnected to the devices responsible for simulating the appliances of the house.4.3. ResultsThis subsection presents the obtained results from the process described in Section 4.2,where each sub-system has its own results. However, through TOOCC, the results of a sub-system havea direct impact on the systems that are dependent on its results in order to proceed with their execution.Thus, the following figures show the results of each sub-system. Firstly, the results regarding thescheduling made by NM using ERM will be presented. Then, it is possible to verify the obtainedinformation from local energy management of Load 15, namely through SHIM and PLCMAS. At theend of the subsection, the results of the case study are discussed in a more comprehensive perspectiveof the problem, explaining how the results are related and the advantages of interoperability betweenthose systems.Figure 7a,b allows one to understand what will be the origin of the energy, which will be used tosupply the expected consumption of the microgrid. It is possible to observe that the largest source ofAppl. Sci. 2018, 8, 328 14 of 21used energy will be the DG (about 85%), except for the first hours of the day, where there is no sunlightand the wind speed is not enough to satisfy the entire energy demand. In these cases, it is necessary toobtain energy from external energy sources, namely from the electricity market (14%), the use of energystored in batteries (1%), for example EV, and demand response (with negligible value). Throughoutthe day, when there is surplus production, it is possible to sell energy to other entities, as seen between3 a.m. and 10 a.m., and at the end of the day, in a total of 9898 kW.(a)(b)Figure 7. Real-time scheduling results for generation: (a) full overview; (b) production distribution.By analyzing the energy consumption of the microgrid through Figure 8a,b, it can be seen that thetwo largest sources of energy consumption refer to EV charging (24%) and loads (69%), e.g., pluggingin. In addition, there are no battery charges, so the surplus energy is all sold outside the microgrid.The graph shown in Figure 9 illustrates the scheduling done by NM for Load 15. Since this loadsimulates the operation of a house, its energy consumption profile differs with the generality of themicrogrid. In addition, one can see how the results ranged between day-ahead, hour-ahead andreal-time scheduling. The highest peak of consumption is in the evening (between 6 p.m. and 11 p.m.),something that is traditional in the domestic consumer\u2019s profile. It is also during this period thatthere is a greater demand response, where consumption is transferred to other periods with lowerconsumption, such as after 12 a.m.Appl. Sci. 2018, 8, 328 15 of 21Figure 10 presents the local scheduling of Load 15, considering the ERM load limit per period.Here can be seen the cuts needed to meet the limits imposed by the NM and the shifting ofconsumptions for off-peak hours, in order to have a more uniform consumption over time andto take advantage of the hours when energy is less expensive. In order to protect some cut devices,the FM sets priorities, where those with the highest priority are not cut. In this case study, since itrefers to the winter season, the HVAC and water heater devices have the highest priority since they areimportant to fight the cold.(a)(b)Figure 8. Real-time scheduling results for consumption: (a) full overview; (b) consumption distribution.The home energy scheduling enables the real-time adaptation of the considered house to multipleevents that occur at higher levels of the energy value chain. In particular, the effective control of thephysical energy consumption devices is performed as a result of the intelligent energy managementthat takes into account the variations of local generation, energy prices and user preferences andhabits. Moreover, the applied demand response and energy prices result directly from the energyresources management performed by the aggregator, which, in turn, considers the perspective ofthe whole aggregated area and respective players, in terms of generation, consumption and storage.Finally, the wholesale market itself has an indirect influence on the outcomes of the energy planningin the house, since the prices considered in the energy scheduling at the aggregator level considerAppl. Sci. 2018, 8, 328 16 of 21the participation and impact in the market. This bidirectional flow of information, from the smalldevice inside the house to the wholesale market, and vice versa, can only be achieved by means ofadvanced systems that integrate multiple specific sub-systems, such as TOOCC. TOOCC supportsthe communication and integration between a diversity of different systems, algorithms and players,thus enabling the co-simulation of the full energy chain, which cannot be achieved by using thedifferent tools independently and in a non-integrated way. The results of this case study therebydemonstrate the advantages and significant advances that TOOCC brings to the current literature.Figure 9. Aggregator scheduling result for the emulated smart home.Figure 10. GECAD\u2019s smart home energy scheduling results.Appl. Sci. 2018, 8, 328 17 of 215. ConclusionsThe large-scale integration of the DG into EM presents several challenges for the stakeholders,aiming at a balance between satisfying its own needs, not wasting energy and preventing failures.In this scope, analysis and simulation tools allow participant entities to have mechanisms that allowthem to achieve their objectives.This paper presents the TOOCC framework as a new solution to allow the interoperability betweenheterogeneous systems in the area of energy systems simulation, through the construction of scenarios,its simulation and analysis of the obtained results. Scenarios can be configured to simulate moreor less complex problems, integrating multiple multi-agent systems and combining their individualcapabilities into a more complete simulator, in order to study the behavior of the involved entities,new market models, consumption profiles, energy management of the network and virtual powerplants, among other concepts, and its relations. In addition, the simulation of tools for different contextscan also provide decision support to a wide variety of entity types, depending on the user\u2019s purpose.TOOCC provides interoperability; flexibility in the creation of the scenario due to the combination ofinfinite possibilities that result from the personalization of models and possible tools to use; realism byproviding historical data; centralized management of the simulation and the scenario\u2019s configuration;results analysis to provide decision support to its user; automation in all simulation processes; humanerror reduction; and a graphical interface for the user be able to follow all process.In order to achieve interoperability between systems, TOOCC relies on public ontologies to enablesystems to understand the same concepts. For a new tool to be able to communicate with TOOCC,it needs to implement those ontologies or make the necessary mappings.A case study was presented to exemplify how the systems which simulate different entities ofenergy and power systems are interoperable by using the TOOCC framework. The case study isrelative to energy management in a real microgrid, where the interactions between the consumer andthe microgrid aggregator were simulated and studied, in order to understand the benefits that canresult from this. Through forecasts of the consumer\u2019s energy consumption, the aggregator can performbetter energy management of the network, avoiding the waste of energy in the grid and providing theconsumer with cost savings. With this, the consumer can take advantage of periods where energy hasa lower cost, through consumption shifting, avoiding consumption peaks at times where the price ofenergy is higher, without having to reduce his/her comfort and compromising his/her daily needs.Results show that TOOCC allows the simplified configuration of scenarios with a high degree ofcomplexity and that its execution is done automatically, without the need for any human intervention.This supports the conclusion that TOOCC is an innovative enhanced decision support system,which allows one to go a step further in the study and simulation of this field. For this purpose,the proposed framework provides the mechanisms for the joint simulation and analysis of multiplesystems directed to the study of specific problems, resulting in a complete tool for studying the problemas a whole.As future work, the priority is to enable interoperability with further external systems, to cover thesimulation of other areas in energy systems. It is also intended to provide a public version of the tool,but it is not yet possible to make it fully available due to the existence of integrated systems that interactdirectly with physical devices, some of which may be critical. Since it is intended that the tool is alwaysavailable to the user, it is important that there are no critical faults that jeopardize the good functioningof the system. TOOCC has mechanisms to prevent communication failures between agents, takingadvantage of the potential of the ACL\u2019s message format. However, work must be done in this regard.Moreover, it is also necessary to improve the fault simulation mechanism (e.g., technical problems ina microgrid node), since it is in an initial state, due to its complexity. Another aspect to improve relatesto the availability of more complete results\u2019 analysis mechanisms.Appl.

INTRODUCTION\nFrom the beginning, power systems have been complex\nartificial systems to operate. Over time, complexity has been\nrising and control room operators have been using more and\nmore applications setting side by side on multiple screens to\nmanage the system. While this simple approach to incremen-\ntally grow a monitoring alarm-driven management system has\nbeen relatively effective until now, we are now reaching a glass\nceiling to add in any new application. This is true in terms of\nphysical space, but most importantly, in terms of manageable\ncognitive load for any human operator. In that regard, human-\nmachine interfaces have indeed been identified as a risk factor\nto human error [1] and should be considered more closely. In\naddition, latest research in physchology [2] and neuroscience\n[3] have shed light on human decision-making process and\nits limits, which could be a lead to improve in turn decision-\nmaking.\nNowadays, the system complexity keeps rising given the\nadvent of intermittent renewable energies on the production\nside and of prosumers on the demand side, coupled with\nthe globalization of energy markets over a more and more\ninterconnected European grid. Grids are also aging, and grid\ndevelopments become more limited nowadays. Operators will\nhence need to operate a system closer to its limits while\ndealing with additional automaton on the grid inducing cyber-\nphysical dynamics [4]. While there could eventually be a\ntemptation to develop a fully autonomous grid to cope with\nthat complexity, it fails short for such large critical system\noperations. Indeed coordination, responsibility, accountability,\nand explainability are a must when operating such a system\nand can only be reasonably achieved by humans today: human\noperators remain key players. Lately, several works have\nproposed situation awareness frameworks [5] [6] to help aug-\nment the operator\u2019s comprehension of safety-critical situations\nespecially. In addition to better information processing, it is\nalso urgent to rethink the operator human-machine interface\n[5] and interactions to assist the operator\u2019s regular real-time\ndecision making. Rather than having operators adapt to the\nmachine through a technology-centered system engineering\ndesign, machine and operator\u2019s could co-adapt following hu-\nman centered-design [7].\nIn terms of interfaces, we have seen tremendous innovations\nin other domains, especially in consumer products such as\nsmartphones, connected homes, social media and social net-\nworks, search engines, recommendation systems. They have\nbeen well-adopted for displaying the most relevant information\nto the user on single screens through homogeneous format,\nwhile dealing in the background with vast diverse amounts\nof information and user interactions. The development of\nsuch interfaces has also been made possible thanks to the\nlatest developments of Artificial intelligence (AI) in the last\ndecade. These developments enabled more advanced and\npractical large scale real-time information processing, such\nas in computer vision [8], image understanding [9], natural\nlanguage processing [10], recommendations [11]. This now\ntranslates into an even more advanced form of interface: an\nassistant. Assistants were found useful to both improve user\u2019s\nperformance on tasks and enhance group collaboration on a\ncommon task [12]. In power systems, the notion of an AI\nassistant was used lately in [13] [14].\nIn this paper, we present the design of an AI-infused\nassistant for the control room operator based on the latest de-\nvelopments in human-computer interaction design (HCID), AI,\nand decision-making science. We first review the effectiveness\nand limits of humans and AI in decision making, highlighting\ntheir complementarities. We further define an assistant. We\nthen discuss the specificities of an assistant for grid operators.\nFinally, we devise guidelines for how researchers can develop\nand test such an assistant.\nar\nX\niv\n:2\n01\n2.\n02\n02\n6v\n1 \n [\nst\nat\n.M\nL\n] \n 3\n D\nec\n 2\n02\n0\nII. EFFECTIVENESS AND LIMITS/BIAS OF HUMAN AND AI\nIN TAKING DECISIONS\nA. Human decision making\nHuman Decision-making is primarily a matter of atten-\ntion and executive control [3]. Taking proper decisions first\ninvolves paying attention to the right information in the\nenvironment and making sense of it. It further implies se-\nlecting relevant actions while inhibiting inappropriate ones,\nand eventually executing one in a timely-manner. Following\ndual process theory [2], we can describe 2 underlying fictitious\noperating and cooperative agents, called System 1 and System\n2. System 1 is the fast intuitive and heuristic agent while\nSystem 2 is the slow and reasoning agent. System 2 is the\none responsible for decisions assisted by System 1 which\ncontinuously provides him predictions for action. Most of the\ntime, System 2 just lazily accepts System 1 proposal in usual\nsituations without much more thinking, resulting in successful,\nquick and cognitively effortless decisions. When confronted\nto unusual situations however, System 2 can develop more\nexplicit conscious thinking, beyond System 1 predictions, to\ndeliberate and come up with novel and acceptable decisions\nwhile cognitively costly.\nYoung operators will rely more heavily on System 2 and\ncan hence struggle taking any good decision on time for\nseveral situations that still appear complex and unusual for\nthem. As they are very focused on trying to make sense of\nit, they have a narrow attention and might miss important\nnew information. As they learn overtime through appropriate\ntraining and feedback becoming expert, their intuitive System\n1 grows for that field of expertise, enabling them taking\ngood and quick decisions even more often with ease. For\nan expert operator, it has become a lot easier to operate a\nsystem intuitively, being able to take more decisions as well as\ndecisions in more difficult situations. However, the downside\ncan be overconfidence, overlooking unusual information that\nwould require more deliberation from System 2.\nB. Human biases and desirable assistance\nBecause it relies on fast heuristics and mostly jump to\nconclusions, System 1 indeed introduces several potential\nbiases which can lead to human errors, hence limiting the\neffectiveness of human decision-making. Cognitive biases are\nbeautifully summarized in the cognitive bias codex [15] and\nclassified through 4 problems they are trying to circumvent: a\nlimited memory, the need to act fast, the information overload\nand a lack of meaning. Among possibly damaging biases, we\ncan more specifically list:\n\u2022 anchoring bias: be over-reliant on the first piece of\ninformation we see.\n\u2022 confirmation bias: tend to pay attention only to informa-\ntion that confirms our preconceptions.\n\u2022 overfidence bias: too confident about one\u2019s abilities which\ncauses to take greater risks.\n\u2022 information bias: tendency to seek information when it\ndoes not affect action (more information is not always\nbetter).\n\u2022 availability heuristic: overestimate the importance of in-\nformation that is available.\n\u2022 ostrich effect: ignore dangerous or negative information.\n\u2022 outcome bias: judge a decision based on the outcome\nrather than how exactly the decision was made.\nAn assistant should hence help the operator avoid falling\ninto those biases by addressing the following needs:\n\u2022 augment its memory, knowledge retrieval and keep track\nof latest events\n\u2022 better filter or highlight information, enhancing attention\n\u2022 make sense of a situation and give feedback\n\u2022 make recommendations, possibly handle some tasks or\nalert on some undesirable expected consequences\nLet\u2019s now consider what AI in its latest developments could\nbring in that regard.\nC. AI potential for assistance\nThe latest deep learning revolution demonstrated some\nimpressive practical abilities of AI, being able to digest lots\nof information, memorize large historical datasets, and learn\nby imitation to infer quickly effective actions in context.\nTuring-award Yoshua Bengio recently described current deep-\nlearning AI as a System 1 kind of intelligence [16], while\nmissing System 2 type. It is indeed presented as advanced\npattern matching and recognition machines like System 1 [2],\nbeing coined as artificial intuition [17]. It however lacks the\nability to reason about causality [18], hence lacking under-\nstanding and some common sense. Yet Human and AI can be\nseen as complementary heterogeneous intelligences that could\nachieve a superior outcome when combined by co-evolving\nand learning from each other [19]. This is best exemplified by\nCentaur\u2019s chess [20], having humans play with machines, and\nnot against, to reach a superior performance. Used through an\nassistant, AI seems capable of addressing the needs mentioned\npreviously, providing a complimentary and hence enhanced\nSystem 1 to the operator whose System 2 remains in charge\nof decisions overall.\nTo be used effectively by any human however, the AI\nassistant will need to work along with a proper interface.\nIndeed, while human Systems 1 and 2 are fully integrated\ninto a cognitive system as a whole, AI and human are clearly\nseparated entities at first. Interactions, communication and\nshared representations [21] need to be defined. Interpretable\n[22], explainable [23] and trustworthy [24] AI are in that\nregard attributes that should get integrated into the assistant.\nThe AI should eventually be provably beneficial to humans,\npursuing preferably not a fixed pre-determined objective but\npursuing operator\u2019s fuzzy objectives, by continuously learning\nits preferences under uncertainty [25]. Moving away from\nthese different maturing fields of AI that should prove useful\nto create an assistant, let\u2019s now define it more precisely.\nIII. DEFINING AN ARTIFICIAL ASSISTANT\nAn assistant is an agent that helps in someone\u2019s job,\nsupporting him and taking over on agreed tasks when possible.\nA. Assistant: balancing assistance, user control and Automa-\ntion\nTo make things clearer, we should distinguish an assistant\nfrom single assistance functions and from a whole automaton.\nAn assistance function helps the user gather or alert him about\nsome new relevant information. It can take in a user request in\nsome expected format and compute a result to be interpreted.\nOther ones can also monitor the user state and warn him about\nrisks it does not seem aware of. Situation awareness offers, in\nthat sense, advanced assistance functions. An assistant relies\non assistance functions at its core. But importantly, it also\nengages actively with the user. It offers a unified interface\nand allows for dynamic bidirectional interactions with the\nuser to cooperate efficiently on task completion. However, in\nthat configuration, the user remains responsible for the proper\noperations of the system. While some tasks could eventually\nbecome automated if they always get delegated to the assistant,\nthere is no explicit goal to automate any particular task in the\nfirst place: this is mostly left to the user\u2019s choice over time.\nOther industrial sectors have also defined different auton-\nomy levels that we can reflect on, like the one from the\nInternational Association of Public Transport :\n\u2022 GoA0: Manual operation with no automatic protection\n\u2022 GoA1: Manual operation with automatic protection\n\u2022 GoA2: Semi-automatic operation\n\u2022 GoA3: Driverless operation\n\u2022 GoA4: Unattended operation\nMany such fields, however, aims at a fully autonomous\nsystem without operators. They diverge on that point from\nour goal of obtaining an augmented operator through an\nassistant, which is closer to GoA2 level. Beyond that point,\nGoA3 and GoA4 are targeting automation, and thus ends the\ncomparison to our probem here. GoA1 and GoA2 offers as-\nsistance functions discussed previously, but without too much\nconsiderations of interface and interactions. An assistant, as\nwe illustrate on Figure1 and later discuss, is yet a subsequent\nlevel not described there whose goal is to offer the right\nbalance between user control and autonomy [21] for enhanced\ndecision-making. We will now focus on the interface and\ninteractions that more uniquely defines an assistant.\nB. Hypervision: smart interface & information management\nToday\u2019s supervision leaves the user the cognitive load to\nprioritize, organize, and link every displayed information and\nalarms before considering any decision. It can be regarded as\na fragmented ecosystem from an operator viewpoint. While it\nhas been manageable for up to ten applications, it becomes\nimpractical with always more information and uncoordinated\napplications to control under heterogeneous formats. Super-\nvision gives access to the user to every information available\nwithout much more processing. However, it does not help deal\nwith the information overload and lack of meaning problems\nFig. 1. The AI operator\u2019s assistant: Hypervision interface, bidirectional\ninteractions and AI components running altogether in a coordinated and\nmodular fashion. Continuous revision is important to up to date shared\nrepresentations\nthat need to be tackled for improved decision making: it dilutes\nthe operator\u2019s attention. Let\u2019s recall that humans can only take\nsequential decisions one after another, with a limited working\nmemory space of 4 information to manipulate at a time.\nTo be effective at continuous decision-making, it is im-\nportant to focus on one task at a time, with the highest\npriority, and present only the most relevant information to it. In\nthat regard, we propose an \u201chypervision\u201d framework to bring\nthe right information at the right time to the right person.\nIt helps overcome multiple biases, such as both information\nbias and anchoring bias, by taking advantage of them rather\nthan being influenced by them. Hypervision relies on the\ndefinition of tasks created by processing and synthesizing\nthe necessary information. Those tasks do not have to be\nonly-real time. However, they are still preferably the ones\nanticipated to be completed or configured ahead of time\nthanks to forecast, hence defining an expected trajectory that\nmight be adapted along the way. Reaching this higher level\nof information enables the assistant to establish a simplified\nbut relevant dialogue with the operator, eventually providing\nhim with diagnostics or even recommendations on solutions.\nHence, hypervision\u2019s goal is to refocus the operator on task\ncompletion rather than alarm monitoring, as illustrated in\nfigure 2. It creates the basis for more advance and effective\nbidirectional interactions under shared representations of tasks.\nFig. 2. Alarm monitoring with Supervision - Task completion with Hypervi-\nsion\nC. Bidirectional interactions\nWhile the choice of the interaction modalities (visual, audio,\nhaptic, etc.), as well as the form of the assistant avatar matters\nfor enhanced interactions, we will leave it open here and focus\non the importance of bidirectional interactions.\nHuman-Machine interactions have become a new scientific\ndiscipline in the 80\u2019s, especially thanks to Lucy Suchman\n[26]. At a time AI was mostly centered around expert systems\nwith pre-defined rules, she shed light on the ineffectiveness of\nsuch systems, mostly attributed to the lack of well-designed\ninteractions and learning loops beyond knowledge retrieval.\nShe noted that plans, similarly to predefined rules, are not\nprescriptive and not something to follow exactly, because\neverything eventually depends on circumstances and contin-\ngencies. Plans should rather be seen as heuristic and available\nresources for actions that help focus one\u2019s attention while\nabstracting the details, but that should get updated through\ninteractions to take appropriate decisions. In the end, interfaces\nshould not draw a dry delimitation with its user but rather re-\nconfigures itself and conforms with it.\nResearch [27] has shown an increased efficiency in Human-\nAI coupling when both agents were able to initiate and respond\nto interactions. These were historically mostly unidirectional,\nthe assistant either asking a predefined set of questions to\nbuild its context representation, or the user asking to perform\nsome predefined tasks. In a bidirectional relationship, the\ninteraction is collaborative, with neither the system nor the\nuser in control of the whole interaction. The assistant is\ncapable of interacting with the latter to refine its context\nrepresentation (e.g. ask for a clarification when ambiguities\narise), thus improving its efficiency when asked to perform a\nspecific task. A good example of such bidirectional interaction\nis found in [28], where when asked to find the shortest path to\nevacuate wounded people, the assistant will for instance first\nask which vehicles are available, then react accordingly.\nWhile new approaches let an assistant learn how and when\nto defer to an expert [29], creating true human-computer\npartnerships becomes a practical reality [30], [21] and are the\nobject of study of the \u201dCockpit and Bidirectional Assistant\u201d\nproject [31]. We should now review the expected functions of\nsuch an assistant.\nIV. EXPECTED FUNCTIONS FOR AN ASSISTANT\nThe paper [32] provides a \u201dunified set of design guidelines\u201d\nto keep in mind when designing AI-infused assistants, helpful\nfor deciding which features should receive a particular focus.\nWe highlight below a relevant subset of these guidelines:\n\u2022 Time services based on context - Grid operators evolve\nin a time-constrained environment where having the right\ninformation at the right time is paramount. An assistant\nshould engage interaction when the context allows it,\nbased on the operator\u2019s cognitive load and impact of\nthe interaction. An assistant should logically engage the\noperator with a new task if more critical, while not\ndisturbing him from the current one if critical.\n\u2022 Show contextually relevant information - While knowl-\nedge databases might suggest to the operator some usual\ncurative action for a given issue, the context of a nearby\nmaintenance, for instance, might make it inefficient. This\ncontextual event should be brought to the operator\u2019s\nattention in that case. Inversely, insensitive context should\nget filtered out.\n\u2022 Support efficient invocation and dismissal - The num-\nber of actions an operator can do in a time period is\nlimited, and interacting with an assistant should be as\nefficient as possible and not a burden. Should the assistant\nbe in charge of a task, it should not invoke subsequent\ninteractions on it if nothing significant has changed.\nIn tense situations, the assistant should be shorter and\ndismiss its interaction sooner.\n\u2022 Support efficient correction / Encourage granular\nfeedback - Grid operators are well-trained experts, ca-\npable of evaluating the assistant\u2019s answers and provide\nfeedback. Thus, the latter must be able to learn from\nthem, for instance, by understanding in hindsight that\nsome additional context needs to be considered to select\na curative action or remembering that a line is under\nmaintenance during a defined period.\n\u2022 Inform the user about uncertainty in services provided\n- If there is too much uncertainty yet when considering\nsome preventive actions, it is reasonable to inform the\noperator about it so that he waits for the last instant to\ndecide, before the action opportunity expires. Also, the\noperator should be able to assess any additional risks due\nto its actions in the next hours. Operators should also\nget informed of possibly missing or bad quality data and\nhence uncertain observability. The operator should finally\nknow if any result is deterministic or probabilistic.\n\u2022 Scope services when in doubt - When not yet sure\nabout some action implementation because of uncertainty,\nthe operator can first simply indicate his intention of\nusing such or such flexibility and later decide how he\nwould like to implement it: the assistant should be able to\ndeal with different levels of abstraction. This is also true\nwhen giving some contextual information: ahead of time,\nit might be more relevant to only communicate about\naggregated loads in some areas, only sharing individual\nload values near more certain real-time.\n\u2022 Learn from user behaviour / Remember recent inter-\nactions - Operators often have specific decision-making\nprocesses, some relying on numerous power-flow sim-\nulations to assess a situation, others more akin to rely\non their expertise of the considered area, and a good\nassistant should adjust to these user-specific behaviours.\nFor instance, when supporting a user accustomed to\nsimulations, it could recompute them when the user is\nbusy on the phone to integrate the latest grid changes\nwhen he hangs up.\n\u2022 Convey the consequences of user actions - As well as\nassistants should learn over time, so should operators!\nIt is often deplored that the consequences of unary grid\noperations are poorly monitored, which in return, prevent\noperators from valuable feedback. Assistants delivering a\ndetailed report of how the grid evolved after a specific\naction would tremendously speed up the way operators\nacquire experience, and yield better grid management.\nInterpretability and explainability are required here.\nThe assistant should eventually help the operator prioritize\nhis tasks thanks to these functions and the hypervision inter-\nface. We will now propose some initial guidelines to more\nconcretely design, implement and test such an assistant.\nV. GUIDELINES FOR DESIGNING, IMPLEMENTING AND\nTESTING AN ASSISTANT\nDesigning an assistant in practice might still seem complex\nbeyond the discussed framework and principles. We devise\nhere some pragmatic guidelines to start simple on a common\nbut modular ground, listing some already available building\nblocks as well.\nA. Grounded Design Considerations\n1) Modeling Tasks as shared representations: It should be\nnoted that in other industrial sectors such as aeronautics, tasks\nin processes have been codified more precisely at a granular\nlevel, which gives the operator a clearer framework to work\nand coordinate with, as for the assistant. We should aim at\nsuch explicit modeling.\nA task is first defined by the problem it needs to solve\nspecifically, such as a safety problem - an overload over a line,\nits priority and the residual time to complete it. It should then\ncontain relevant context to understand the root of the problem,\nwhat might be already known about it, recent related events\nor tasks, as well as the persons involved. It should further\ncome with some suggestions about available actions to the\noperators, and their expected effectiveness. It should finally\nretain a decision for completion and meta-attributes about it.\nTask categories and attributes should be more exhaustively\nestablish through future works.\nAlso, opposite to traditional approaches in power systems\nthat mainly tries to focus on the most critical situations we ever\nhave to solve, we suggest here to start studying tasks in regular\nsituations and gradually increasing the number of needed\nbidirectional interactions. To operators it should prove useful\nto start with the most basic but sometimes time-consuming\ntasks with often low added value. That way, building trust in\nthe first place should be easier while still helping ease their\ncognitive load.\n2) Simple situational use case as a sandbox: We offer a\nsimple interesting use case to highlight key difficulties in daily\ngrid management through the interplay here of preventive and\ncurative decisions under uncertainty. This makes us think about\nhow the operator-agent interaction should take place.\nAn operator starts monitoring a grid composed of two\nsmaller areas at 7:00am. Forecasts show that an incident\nshould occur around 9:00am in area 1, with three available\ncorrective actions after simulations, each being able to be\nexecuted just before 9:00am. Another incident should happen\naround 8:30am in area 2, leaving only a couple of minutes\nto execute the only preventive action. A couple of questions\nFig. 3. A simple scenario where incidents are forecasted in multiple parts of a\ngrid, and several corrective actions with different setup durations are possible.\nGreen dots each represent an available action, and the blue arrows the time it\nneeds to be effective. For instance, starting a nuclear power plant takes longer\nthan applying topological grid changes, and would have a longer blue arrow.\narises:\n\u2022 Which decisions have priority ? It seems that a preventive\naction on area 2 should be urgently taken, but maybe the\nforecast isn\u2019t that reliable. The assistant should be able\nto provide the operator with these uncertainties.\n\u2022 How should the result of the simulations be presented\nto the operator ? We can see that the last simulation\nof 8:00am in area 1 shows that the forecasted incident\nshould not happen anymore. Is it a simulation artifact,\nor has the situation improved with more recent mea-\nsurements? Maybe the assistant should run successive\nsimulations over time and alert the operator as soon as\nthe forecasted situation evolves.\n\u2022 How does applying a corrective action on area 1 reflect\non area 2 ? Would it lead to a less secure grid state\n? What coordination is required ? Maybe there\u2019s a new\nmaintenance operation in this area that isn\u2019t taken into\naccount by the simulation.\n\u2022 Which of the three corrective action in area 1 should be\ntaken ? The operator has to mediate between economical,\npractical and safety arguments, each with a degree of\nuncertainty. How could the assistant be helpful there ?\nOur objective here is not to provide any viable solution,\nbut rather to demonstrate that grid operators are confronted\nwith complex decisions even on apparently simple cases, in\nwhich context-dependent trade-offs always have to be made.\nFuture works could build a library of such canonical cases to\nbe studied in the community.\nB. Unified Interface & Data collection as an industrial stack\nThe hypervision framework relies on a generic and sin-\ngle interface that should be able to integrate any kind of\ntasks, and apply to different industrial systems for instance.\nWhile previous supervised applications would still run in the\nbackground, hypervision is a master process responsible for\ndisplaying the right information in a proper and standardized\nformat. An example of such an existing framework is the\nopen-source Operator Fabric [33] which could be used both by\nindustrial and researchers as a unified interface for decision-\nmaking processes. Such a framework is also a corner-stone\nto digitalize the decision-making process, centralize every\nnecessary information and hence capitalize on them. This his-\ntorical data-collection is essential for continuous improvement,\nexperiments, as well as for creating the datasets from which AI\ncan learn recommendations. Data should get labelled and its\nquality properly monitored. These developments should create\na necessary technical stack for an assistant.\nC. Power system AI modules for assistant functions\nRecent surveys list interesting developments of AI for power\nsystems [34], [35]. For an assistant, AI can today be used\nto make corrective action recommendations to an operator\nthrough adaptive interpretable expert system [14], imitation\nlearning [13] or reinforcement learning [36]. It can learn from\nuser behaviour and help convey the consequences of operator\u2019s\naction by comparison. Exhaustive risk assessment [37] also\nhelps in prioritizing tasks. Further, automatic hierarchical\nand contextual representations of the grid [38] enable scope\nservices and give greater flexibility to convey the right context\nand interpret a situation. [39] also lets an AI learn interpretable\nand physically-consistent contextual indicators associated with\na particular operator\u2019s task. Finally, [40], [41] and [42] let\noperators explore interactively and iteratively historical ex-\nplainable factors across similar situations and decisions for\naugmenting and keeping up-to-date the system knowledge\nand proper labels. This is an illustrative sample of today\u2019s\nAI potential to provide effective assistance functions. New\ndevelopments are needed to augment the assistant functions\ncontinuously.\nD. Assistant evaluation & development of shared benchmarks\nIn order to assess the relevance of an assistant in a real-\nworld scenario, and eventually compare multiple assistants,\nit is necessary to set up repeatable evaluation protocols and\ndefine common benchmark tasks.\n1) Evaluation: As for now, there is not yet a standard\ntesting protocol to evaluate artificial assistants. However, we\ncould draw insights from other domains such as interpretable\nmachine-learning [22] or interactive visualization [43]. As\ndone in [22], we could come to structured and step-by-\nstep experimental practices to evaluate candidate-assistants on\nincrementally difficult task.\nMoreover, several Virtual-Assistant (VA) related studies\nhave also tried to define custom evaluation criteria. For in-\nstance in [44], authors compare their VA against both a sim-\npler interactive data-exploration scheme and a non-interactive\nsolution-search. They assess the use of their assistant on three\nfactors :\n\u2022 Performance - Is an operator more efficient with a VA\n? Here, task-specific performance metrics are used.\n\u2022 Human-learning - Is a virtually-assisted operator learn-\ning as much about the problem and it\u2019s underlying model\nthan without the assistant ? This factor is assessed using\nquestions and tests at the end of each task.\n\u2022 Usability - Is a user able to able to handle the use of the\nassistant ? This evaluation is performed using a standard\nSystem Usability Scale (SUS) [45].\n2) Benchmarks: Because of confidentiality issues, it is of-\nten hard to share real-world data on decision-making problems.\nThus, we should aim at developing synthetic but realistic\nenvironments from which to extract representative and relevant\nscenarios. To define these scenarios, we could rely on already\nexisting decision-making assessment frameworks, such as [46]\noriginally designed for road safety. Moreover, synthetic and\nrealistic environments for sequential decision-making have\nrecently been developed for power systems [47] and could\nbe interactively further studied with grid2viz study tool [48].\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have presented the framework and princi-\nples for designing an AI assistant for grid operators, opening\nnew research directions for augmented decision-making. We\nhave provided initial guidelines and already available materials\nin power systems to start exploring this rich and promising new\nfield of human-machine partnerships.\nREFERENCES\n[1] E.

      "abstract": "In the push to develop smart energy systems, designers have increasingly focused on systems that measure and predict user behavior to effect optimal energy consumption. While such focus is an important component in these systems' success, designers have paid substantially less attention to the people on the other side of the energy system loop-the supervisors of power generation processes. Smart energy systems that leverage pervasive computing could add to these supervisory control operators' workload. They'll have to predict possible power plant load and production changes caused by environmental and plant events, as well as dynamic system adaptation in response to consumer behaviors. Contrary to many assumptions, inserting more automation, including distributed sensors and algorithms to postprocess data, won't necessarily reduce operators' workload or improve system performance",
