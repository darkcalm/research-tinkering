This Part provides a brief primer on climate change. It focuses \non its technical and data challenges and provides examples of AI\u2019s generic \nclimate applications for reducing GHGs. \nA.

Artificial Intelligence for Optimizing Grid Assets \nOne of the most obvious AI applications for the electricity sector involves \noptimizing grid assets: improving the way energy is used in the grid, both for \nconservation and efficiency purposes.77 While the U.S. grid has historically \nbeen comprised of thousands of large, centralized generation sources (for \nexample, power plants), the grid has been undergoing a significant \ntransformation. This transformation includes an increase in renewable \ngeneration sources, many of which are taking the form of smaller, distributed \nresources (for example, rooftop solar and energy storage), a smart grid to help \nfacilitate these resources, and a shift toward more electric vehicles. This section \naddresses AI applications in each of these four areas. \nIntermittent Renewables. A first step to reduce GHG emissions from the \nelectricity sector is to shift the country\u2019s reliance from fossil fuels to \nrenewables. In 2019, the United States relied on fossil fuels for approximately \nsixty-three percent of its electricity needs.78 Renewable penetration, however, \nhas been growing steadily and is projected to comprise seventy-six percent of \nnew planned U.S. generating capacity in 2020.79 But much of renewable energy \n \n73.

For instance, Google and DeepMind applied \nmachine learning to wind power capacity in the United States \u201cto better predict \nwind power output thirty-six hours ahead of actual generation,\u201d assisting in \noptimal hourly day-ahead delivery commitments.82 Google claims that the use \nof machine learning boosted the value of its wind energy by approximately \ntwenty percent.83 \n\u201cAI is increasingly being used to manage the intermittency of renewable \nenergy so that more can be incorporated into the grid; it can handle power \nfluctuations and improve energy storage as well.\u201d84 For example, AI can be \nused to adjust wind-farm propellers to keep up with changing wind directions, \ntherefore decreasing the intermittency issue of wind turbines.85 Similarly, AI \ncan help design the layout of renewable energy sources, such as solar power or \nwind-turbine farms.86 Perhaps most impressively, AI can improve the storage \nof renewable energy during intermittent periods of downtime87 by maximizing \nthe efficiency of large energy batteries to prolong their lifespans with fewer \nissues.88 Such efficiency maximization requires large-scale data analysis, \nmaking it ideal for AI involvement.89 \nDistributed Resources.

At least two \navenues exist to help facilitate such collaborations: (1) rigorous procedures for \nanonymizing energy data; and (2) regulating data ownership, each of which is \ndiscussed below. \nAnonymizing Data. Anonymization of data is a commonly used technique \nfor protecting data privacy. Anonymization is the process of deidentifying data, \nsuch that the information can no longer \u201creasonably identify, relate to, describe, \nreference, be capable of being associated with, or be linked, directly or \nindirectly, to a particular individual.\u201d251 Common data-anonymization \ntechniques include randomization252 and generalization.253 \nIn the United States, data-protection laws provide safe harbors for entities \nthat anonymize their data.254 However, anonymized data is often not entirely \n \na warrant in a drug operation to gather electricity data from a home because it did not \u201creveal intimate \ndetails about activity within the home\u201d); People v.

Rptr. 2d 89, 94 (App. 1999) (holding \nthat no warrant was needed to gather data on energy consumption because \u201c[i]t only tells officers how \nmuch electricity is being delivered by the utility and, by comparison to billing records, whether it is \nbeing diverted or stolen\u201d). \n249.

The lack of the ability to have this data, then, hampers \nthe development of the sharing economy and the grid and environmental benefits that could come along \nwith it.\u201d). Although it is not a data sharing organization, sharing technology may be similarly critical. \nSee About Us, INDUS.

Just as human \nfingerprints left at a crime scene can uniquely identify a single person and link \nthat person with \u201canonymous\u201d information, so too do data subjects generate \n\u201cdata fingerprints\u201d\u2014combinations of values of data shared by nobody else in \ntheir table.255 \nThe proposed Online Privacy Act of 2019 addresses these re-identification \nconcerns but did not take an aggressive stance on mandatory anonymization.256 \nIt only required anonymization where efforts to do so are \u201creasonable,\u201d257 a \ncondition that may preclude anonymization of massive amounts of smart meter \ndata,258 not just when it is not \u201can unreasonable amount of effort.\u201d259 \nRegulating Data Ownership. A last option would be the regulation of data \nownership, its use, and its distribution.260 Generally, utility-company customers \nhave a right to access the data, but there are varying views on whether third \nparties can access this data,261 as well as who owns the data.262 Congress has \nalready begun to address these complicated issues, including allowing \ninterested persons access to nonspecific utility-customer information.263 \n \n45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.502 (2019).

If AI has the potential to serve as a cost-effective \ndiagnostic tool for the electric industry to reduce GHGs, why aren\u2019t all the \nutilities jumping on board? One answer may lie in the difficulties of obtaining \ncost recovery for emerging technologies.274 Decisions about cost recovery for \nutility investments, including emerging technologies, are made by state PUCs. \nGiven how many utilities need to obtain regulatory approvals of their \nexpenditures to obtain cost recovery, a critical factor in the advancement of AI \nto enhance efficiencies across the electricity sector is the regulatory treatment \nof emerging technologies. \nEmerging technologies are those that have not been readily proven, and \nchange with the times.275 Nuclear plants were once considered emerging \ntechnologies, as were combined-cycle natural-gas plants.

In addition to PUC hesitancy, investors may similarly view such \nuncertainties as unfavorable in their return-on-investment forecasts. \nEfforts to support such emerging technologies are further hindered by \nexamples of technologies that were approved and failed to meet their potential. \nSuch failures can cost customers millions of dollars, as did Duke Energy\u2019s \nfailed attempts to update and build two nuclear plants, costing ratepayers more \nthan $3 billion.280 Relatedly, an approval of a nuclear repair project in Southern \nCalifornia went awry and cost ratepayers $3.3 billion dollars.281 Even if the \nproject is not an outright failure, a perceived lack of success by ratepayers can \nbe almost as damaging as a complete failure.282 Such failures tend to remain \nfresh on the mind and can be damning for subsequent emerging technologies. \n \n276.

For example, one study found that new medical technologies raised \nhospital expenses by twenty-five percent within a period of only six years.289 \nRenewable technologies provide yet another example. For years, solar-\nenergy generation was significantly more expensive than conventional energy \nsources like natural gas.290 At least a portion of that cost is caused by the fact \nthat as an emerging technology, solar power lacked the infrastructure needed to \nmake it compete significantly with conventional gas.291 But the high demand \nfor solar energy in recent years has driven down prices to the point where they \nare now on par with conventional energy generation.292 The cost of wind \npower, and especially onshore wind power, also now rivals that of fossil \nfuels.293 \nSimilarly, there may be a steep investment curve associated with the use \nof AI. Using AI may require new hardware and software, cloud costs, energy \nand data center costs, training costs, system and business-process integration \ncosts, and manpower.294 And as researchers work to gather, clean, and use data, \nit may be quite expensive to train electricity-sector models to perform as \ndesired.295 As with other emerging technologies, it may be important to \ndevelop a return-on-investment strategy that takes into account some of the \ndifficult-to-quantify benefits of implementing AI in the electricity sector like \nenhanced efficiency, avoided costs, reduced manpower, and improved accuracy \nin results.296 \nAccounting for Capital versus Operating Costs.

Public Investment in Artificial Intelligence \nIn addition to private investment in AI for climate, public funding is \nimperative to its success. Governments at all levels can look for opportunities \nto invest in climate-related AI, as well as adjust government-procurement \npolicies that could harness its benefits. For example, over the last few years, the \nEU government has been proactive in generating funding for AI-related \nprojects.323 The U.S. government has also taken steps toward a more active role \nin AI use and development.324 Over the last ten years, the Department of \nEnergy has invested billions of dollars into new energy infrastructure that \ninterfaces with AI technology to improve energy efficiency.325 Public utilities \n \n317.

Accountability, Safety, and Certification \nA last area of concern is accountability, safety, and certification. This \ninvolves at least two components. First, it demands caution to prevent entities \nfrom labeling everything as \u201cAI\u201d to qualify for funding, cost recovery, and \ngeneral acceptance. Second, processes need to be in place to ensure that AI is \nperforming as expected, which may demand more explainable AI. At present, it \nis extremely difficult to perform \u201cquality control\u201d on AI before we set it loose \non the power grid as no one can fully predict how it will perform.328 Each of \nthese concerns is addressed below. \nAvoiding AI-Washing. The first concern is that of \u201cAI-washing.\u201d Much \nlike whitewashing329 and greenwashing,330 it is imperative that AI not be used \nas a catchall for all matters involving data processing. AI has been around since \nthe 1950s, and yet it has come through its AI winter331 in full bloom. As AI has \nmoved from relative obscurity to common parlance,332 it now carries a certain \ncache that many can use to their advantage.333 Some suggest that people use the \n \n326.

Should entities label their activities as \n\u201cAI\u201d to qualify for certain advantages, AI could become a watered-down term. \nAnd should entities try to squeeze their activities into an \u201cAI\u201d box when that \ndesignation is questionable, it could cast doubt on valid AI. \nOne solution to this concern may be to elicit the assistance of the Federal \nTrade Commission (FTC).

An amorphous term that has moved from obscurity to commonplace as of late, AI here refers to \u201ca set of techniques aimed at approximating some aspect of human or animal cognition using machines.\u201d5 There are many different forms of AI. The most popular form is machine learning, a technology used to make predictions that functions best when using massive amounts of data and computing capacity.6 AI\u2019s tentacles have pervaded many aspects of society, from more mundane uses in Google  1.

I.  Climate Change and Artificial Intelligence Climate change is one of the more daunting problems facing society. But because the worst of its impacts are likely to take place in the future, more immediate and manageable problems that fit within an election cycle often dominate the political stage.19 Behavioral experts even remind us that people are more inclined to discount the greatest dangers in society as a defense mechanism.20 Denial can do wonders for one\u2019s psyche but little for one\u2019s grandchildren. This Part provides a brief primer on climate change. It focuses on its technical and data challenges and provides examples of AI\u2019s generic climate applications for reducing GHGs. A. Climate Change Climate change is a global problem, and addressing it involves both mitigation of carbon emissions and adaptation to its effects. Researchers from around the world have come together to study the basis and impacts of a warming world,21 concluding that human-induced increases of GHG emissions since the industrial revolution have been the \u201cdominant cause\u201d of unprecedented increases in global temperature.22 A 2018 Special Report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C is necessary to reduce challenging impacts on ecosystems and human health and wellbeing.23 To avoid the extreme consequences accompanying a global temperature increase of 2\u00b0C,24 the IPCC declared that greenhouse-gas pollution would have  19.

Our limited understanding may also explain why AI is often defined using examples that illustrate various types of cognitive tasks that computers can accomplish\u2014for example, speech or facial recognition, problem solving, natural language processing\u2014which are narrow and discrete, especially compared to the vast capacities of the human brain.35 At the outset, therefore, it is critically important to at least establish clear conceptual divides, if not clear definitions between three key concepts: data  your face in a photo, or Amazon Echo understands your question, they\u2019re relying on an insight that is over sixty years old.\u201d). 32.

Today\u2019s data analytics often involves machine learning, allowing the process to go beyond just analyzing data by making assumptions, testing, and learning autonomously.42 Machine learning is a collection of techniques that rely upon massive amounts of data to train an algorithm and enable its continuous self-improvement.43 Humans provide the data and specify some key parameters. But at each pass, the algorithm first makes an educated guess about what type of information to look for and then updates the next guess based on how well the previous one worked.44 With that understanding, one can then better understand why machine learning has become the poster child of today\u2019s AI.

Climate Artificial Intelligence and the Electric-Power Sector Beyond AI\u2019s capabilities for climate science, it can also play a vital role in efforts to reduce emissions across one of the largest contributors of GHGs: the electric-power sector. Globally, electricity accounts for roughly twenty-five percent of GHG emissions.69 In the United States, the electric-power sector is the second-leading GHG emitter, accounting for nearly twenty-eight percent of all GHG emissions.70  Furthermore, the demand for electricity is expected to grow as the transportation sector transitions to electric vehicles.71 Such increased electricity use will result in increased GHG emissions unless steps are taken to decarbonize the electric grid. Comprised of generation, transmission, distribution, and consumption of electricity, the electric-power sector has plenty of opportunities for AI, including accelerating the development of clean-energy technologies, improving electricity-demand forecasts, strengthening system optimization and management, and enhancing system monitoring.72 AI may even enable the discovery of new substances for use in batteries storing energy or materials  64.

A. Artificial Intelligence for Optimizing Grid Assets One of the most obvious AI applications for the electricity sector involves optimizing grid assets: improving the way energy is used in the grid, both for conservation and efficiency purposes.77 While the U.S. grid has historically been comprised of thousands of large, centralized generation sources (for example, power plants), the grid has been undergoing a significant transformation. This transformation includes an increase in renewable generation sources, many of which are taking the form of smaller, distributed resources (for example, rooftop solar and energy storage), a smart grid to help facilitate these resources, and a shift toward more electric vehicles. This section addresses AI applications in each of these four areas. Intermittent Renewables. A first step to reduce GHG emissions from the electricity sector is to shift the country\u2019s reliance from fossil fuels to renewables. In 2019, the United States relied on fossil fuels for approximately sixty-three percent of its electricity needs.78 Renewable penetration, however, has been growing steadily and is projected to comprise seventy-six percent of new planned U.S. generating capacity in 2020.79 But much of renewable energy  73.

For instance, Google and DeepMind applied machine learning to wind power capacity in the United States \u201cto better predict wind power output thirty-six hours ahead of actual generation,\u201d assisting in optimal hourly day-ahead delivery commitments.82 Google claims that the use of machine learning boosted the value of its wind energy by approximately twenty percent.83 \u201cAI is increasingly being used to manage the intermittency of renewable energy so that more can be incorporated into the grid; it can handle power fluctuations and improve energy storage as well.\u201d84 For example, AI can be used to adjust wind-farm propellers to keep up with changing wind directions, therefore decreasing the intermittency issue of wind turbines.85 Similarly, AI can help design the layout of renewable energy sources, such as solar power or wind-turbine farms.86 Perhaps most impressively, AI can improve the storage of renewable energy during intermittent periods of downtime87 by maximizing the efficiency of large energy batteries to prolong their lifespans with fewer issues.88 Such efficiency maximization requires large-scale data analysis, making it ideal for AI involvement.89 Distributed Resources. A second and related result of the move toward more renewables is a shift from large, centralized power sources to smaller, decentralized sources located closer to the place of use.90 In the residential  renewables still comprise only seventeen percent of the total generation in the United States.

A third and critical component to facilitating a transformed electric grid is a smarter grid.99 The United States\u2019 electricity industry is expected to spend \u201capproximately $3.5 billion annually [on the smart grid alone] . . . as part of modernization efforts,\u201d reaching $46 billion for the period from 2018 through 2030 (in nominal dollars).100 The Department of Energy (DOE) describes the smart grid as \u201can intelligent electricity grid\u2014one that uses digital communications technology, information systems, and automation to detect and react to local changes in usage, improve system operating efficiency, and, in turn, reduce operating costs while maintaining high system reliability.\u201d101 As just a few examples, winners of the DOE\u2019s 2019 Innovation Challenge proposed the following AI advancements: (a) Southern California Edison: Proposed virtualizing components of electric grid substations and operating them using a human-machine interface (HMI).

Although the transportation and electricity sectors have been historically distinct, this transition is blurring the lines between them.104 This is because the automotive industry will increasingly rely on the electric grid if worldwide sales of EVs continue to grow exponentially.105 EVs are fueled by a much more diverse mix of electricity sources, including some percentage of renewables, that varies depending on the geographic location of the charger.106 In this way, the larger the grid\u2019s reliance on renewables, the larger the GHG reductions that occur from this shift to EVs. AI can be useful in this transformation by helping to improve EV charge scheduling, congestion management, vehicle-to-grid algorithms, and battery-energy management, as well as by assisting in the research and development of EV batteries.107 Moreover, modeling consumer use and charging behavior will be essential for grid operators to predict and manage electric load.108 AI can help coordinate the movement of EVs, optimize their charge cycles, and predict aggregate user demand.109 AI advancements in autonomous vehicles also may play a critical role in decreasing GHG emissions, particularly if they continue to be dominated by electric vehicles.110 A report by the World Economic Forum concluded that AI will be particularly vital to the shift to autonomous connected EVs.111 Incorporating machine learning into autonomous EVs will help optimize transport networks as connected vehicles communicate with one another and  104.

Although global energy demand has increased in recent years,114 U.S. electricity-consumption projections are relatively stagnant.115 However, some researchers project electricity demand could increase by as much as thirty-eight percent with the increased demand created by a massive new fleet of EVs.116 Together, AI can yield significant grid-optimization benefits for the increased intermittent renewables and distributed resources, as well as for smart-grid and EV deployment. B. Artificial Intelligence for Increasing Electric-Grid Efficiency In addition to the shift to electricity resources with a smaller carbon footprint, utilities could also be taking a second, and less obvious, step to reduce GHGs: using AI to target inefficiencies.

On the generation side, AI can help reduce inefficiencies at existing fossil-fuel operations123 and nuclear plants,124 as well as enhance the efficiency of the newer renewable grid resources. For instance, AI can assist in the design and operation of wind and solar farms to make these utility-scale renewable-energy systems much more efficient at generating electricity.125 For wind farms, the turbine heads can be actively oriented to capture a greater fraction of the incoming wind.126 For solar power, with more intelligent solar forecasting, AI can make it easier and more lucrative for solar generators to participate in electricity markets.127 AI can also be instrumental in reducing energy losses in electricity transmission and distribution.128 For example, a distribution-system operator  120.

Blackouts result in devastating economic impacts144 but can have severe environmental impacts too. Downtime creates inefficiencies and waste that cascade through our interconnected grid.145 Manufacturing plants and other businesses often sit idle until the power returns, sometimes causing them to have to start a process over if they were interrupted.146 For example, a short blackout in New York resulted in over twenty-nine tons of food waste.147 The GHG emission-rich process of creating and transporting that food into the city was necessarily repeated because the grid failed for just a few hours.148 In addition, the use of generators and being forced to use alternate forms of transport (if public transportation is unable to operate) can all contribute to increased emissions during blackouts.149 Preventing and swiftly curing blackouts are key to reducing catastrophic impacts.

A first solution, proposed by the Allen Institute for AI, would be having AI researchers include various financial and computational costs in their published results.208 Other scholars also advocate for greater visibility and disclosure of environmental impacts.209 Researchers recently developed a carbon-emissions tracker for machine learning that allows researchers to train the data on their system and then generate emissions totals.210 In addition to emissions disclosures, researchers should report the amount of AI\u2019s other  language, the ambiguity and imprecise characteristics of the natural languages are what make NLP difficult for machines to implement.\u201d); Will Knight, AI Can Do Great Things\u2014If It Doesn\u2019t Burn  Down the Planet, WIRED (Jan. 21, 2020), https://www.wired.com/story/ai-great-things-burn-planet [https://perma.cc/TW9M-47KM] (\u201cRecent advances in natural language processing\u2014an AI technique that helps machines parse, interpret, and generate text\u2014have proven especially power-hungry.\u201d).  206.

A second solution mimics other environmental regimes by contemplating a certification requirement. The Allen Institute proposed a certification for AI practices, labeling carbon-neutral AI as \u201cgreen\u201d and non-carbon-neutral AI as \u201cred.\u201d217 As with other environmental-certification regimes, these labels can have important signaling effects that motivate companies to internalize their electricity use. As with organic-label regulation, federal agencies could be involved in this certification process.218 But as with other environmental-certification regimes, these labels also run the risk of greenwashing.219 Data Sharing.

Data Privacy One of the looming questions across all applications of AI concerns the privacy implications of all this data.232 These questions are no less important for utilities.233 Utilities are in a unique position of power in this situation, as they have enduring relationships with many of their customers, many of whom are captured ratepayers with no retail choice.234 Utilities have had longstanding access to these customers\u2019 data,235 and increasing access to more granular data with the advent of smart meters.236 These smart meters are particularly vexing for privacy issues. Smart meters are bidirectional meters that can be accessed remotely; communicate information on voltage, current, and power directly to utilities; and support smart consumption and pricing applications of distributed resources like rooftop solar.237 If AI functions better the more data it has, data sharing will be critical to successfully implementing AI technologies.238 There are more than  232.

At least two avenues exist to help facilitate such collaborations: (1) rigorous procedures for anonymizing energy data; and (2) regulating data ownership, each of which is discussed below. Anonymizing Data. Anonymization of data is a commonly used technique for protecting data privacy. Anonymization is the process of deidentifying data, such that the information can no longer \u201creasonably identify, relate to, describe, reference, be capable of being associated with, or be linked, directly or indirectly, to a particular individual.\u201d251 Common data-anonymization techniques include randomization252 and generalization.253 In the United States, data-protection laws provide safe harbors for entities that anonymize their data.254 However, anonymized data is often not entirely  a warrant in a drug operation to gather electricity data from a home because it did not \u201creveal intimate details about activity within the home\u201d); People v. Stanley, 86 Cal. Rptr. 2d 89, 94 (App. 1999) (holding that no warrant was needed to gather data on energy consumption because \u201c[i]t only tells officers how much electricity is being delivered by the utility and, by comparison to billing records, whether it is being diverted or stolen\u201d). 249.

Investment and Procurement A key policy tool for facilitating the use of more AI for climate issues is funding. This Section addresses potential funding constraints for three source categories: private regulated utilities, private nonutilities, and public entities. 1. Utility Investing in Artificial Intelligence Regulated utilities, comprising one-third of our country, will experience unique challenges associated with implementing AI. Regulated utilities\u2019 investments are approved by state public utility commissions (PUCs) through ratemaking requests.272 Such PUCs are often skeptical of emerging new technologies, often bound to only approve the least-cost alternative, and utilities are only provided a rate of return for capital investments, not operating costs.273 This raises problems for utilities seeking to use more AI on three fronts: emerging technologies, cost, and accounting classification of AI investments. Emerging Technologies. If AI has the potential to serve as a cost-effective diagnostic tool for the electric industry to reduce GHGs, why aren\u2019t all the utilities jumping on board? One answer may lie in the difficulties of obtaining cost recovery for emerging technologies.274 Decisions about cost recovery for utility investments, including emerging technologies, are made by state PUCs. Given how many utilities need to obtain regulatory approvals of their expenditures to obtain cost recovery, a critical factor in the advancement of AI to enhance efficiencies across the electricity sector is the regulatory treatment of emerging technologies. Emerging technologies are those that have not been readily proven, and change with the times.275 Nuclear plants were once considered emerging technologies, as were combined-cycle natural-gas plants.

In addition to PUC hesitancy, investors may similarly view such uncertainties as unfavorable in their return-on-investment forecasts. Efforts to support such emerging technologies are further hindered by examples of technologies that were approved and failed to meet their potential. Such failures can cost customers millions of dollars, as did Duke Energy\u2019s failed attempts to update and build two nuclear plants, costing ratepayers more than $3 billion.280 Relatedly, an approval of a nuclear repair project in Southern California went awry and cost ratepayers $3.3 billion dollars.281 Even if the project is not an outright failure, a perceived lack of success by ratepayers can be almost as damaging as a complete failure.282 Such failures tend to remain fresh on the mind and can be damning for subsequent emerging technologies.  276.

First, many of the hardware and software cost components could be characterized as more mundane capital costs. Rarely would a line-item present itself as \u201cAI\u201d, but rather as the more innocuous computer-related costs. Second, utilities sometimes insulate themselves from the riskiness of emerging technologies by charging customers in advance.283 Third, state legislatures could mandate the use of AI, shielding the PUC from bearing the brunt of the investment risk. Some states have taken this approach to smart meters by mandating their use,284 contributing to reports that utility investment in smart meters has more than doubled over the past decade.285 Cost. Emerging technologies often take a double hit, as they are not only often viewed as riskier, but they are also often more expensive than incumbent technologies that have had years to work on efficiency improvements.286 These additional costs can come in the form of novel research, design, testing, and manufacturing.287 For new companies, economic factors such as economies of scale also play a large role in raising costs.288 And these costs can indeed be  [https://perma.cc/AK6C-XAYL] (\u201cBy the time the $500 million plant began operating in late 2013, natural gas prices had crashed, which meant GRU, and by extension, taxpayers, were paying much higher prices to get biomass-produced energy than could be gotten from other sources.\u201d). 283.

For example, one study found that new medical technologies raised hospital expenses by twenty-five percent within a period of only six years.289 Renewable technologies provide yet another example. For years, solar-energy generation was significantly more expensive than conventional energy sources like natural gas.290 At least a portion of that cost is caused by the fact that as an emerging technology, solar power lacked the infrastructure needed to make it compete significantly with conventional gas.291 But the high demand for solar energy in recent years has driven down prices to the point where they are now on par with conventional energy generation.292 The cost of wind power, and especially onshore wind power, also now rivals that of fossil fuels.293 Similarly, there may be a steep investment curve associated with the use of AI. Using AI may require new hardware and software, cloud costs, energy and data center costs, training costs, system and business-process integration costs, and manpower.294 And as researchers work to gather, clean, and use data, it may be quite expensive to train electricity-sector models to perform as desired.295 As with other emerging technologies, it may be important to develop a return-on-investment strategy that takes into account some of the difficult-to-quantify benefits of implementing AI in the electricity sector like enhanced efficiency, avoided costs, reduced manpower, and improved accuracy in results.296 Accounting for Capital versus Operating Costs. A last reason that utilities may not be fully realizing AI\u2019s benefits may be related to its accounting classification. Regulated utilities earn a healthy rate of return on their capital investments. As has been noted frequently, this can provide them with a perverse incentive to invest in new construction (e.g., natural gas plants) as  289. PETER J. NEUMANN & MILTON C.

Most studies have shown that using commercial cloud computing can have cost savings for a business over internally managing data.298 Yet utilities have historically been wary of adopting certain emerging technologies such as cloud computing because of the lack of financial incentives to adopt these technologies.

In January 2019, the Illinois Commerce Commission proposed to allow utility companies to prepay for cloud services.307 But the Commission was poised to allow some earnings on pay-as-you-go-services, where the utility pays based on its actual use of the service.308 On July 15, 2020, after three years of proceedings, the Illinois Commerce Commission issued a final rule declining to adopt the proposal \u201cas it lacks necessary consumer protection mechanisms.\u201d309 In a spirited dissent, two commissioners expressed disappointment in Illinois\u2019s decision to stand \u201con the sidelines\u201d rather than be a leader on this issue, noting the lost opportunity to provide regulatory certainty of treatment of these external cloud-computing services as regulatory assets, the lost environmental benefits, and the overblown concerns about consumer protection given these costs would still need to be reviewed for \u201cordinary prudence and reasonableness.\u201d310 Aside from these two states, there has not been widespread response to the NARUC resolution.

Nonutility Private Investment in Artificial Intelligence Nonutilities include the rest of the private players in the electricity sector: merchant plants, universities, entrepreneurs, and clean-energy start-up companies. As just one example, an international group of researchers has formed an organization called \u201cClimate Change AI.\u201d312 The goals of Climate Change AI include facilitating work at the intersection of climate change and machine learning by encouraging the formation of cross-disciplinary teams and promoting discourse about best practices regarding the use of machine learning in climate-change domains.313 These private players may be more dependent on public-sector funding and grants for AI and climate.314 However, the latest wave of AI technology seems to have brought its own wave of funding. Investments in AI are booming with corporate and venture capital support.315 Some may have the backing of large activist corporate actors.316 According to Forbes magazine \u201cin 2010 the average early-stage round for AI or machine learning startups was about $4.8 million. However, in 2017, total funding increased to $11.7 million[,] . . . and in 2018 AI investment hit an all-time high with over $9.3 billion raised by AI  311.

Public Investment in Artificial Intelligence In addition to private investment in AI for climate, public funding is imperative to its success. Governments at all levels can look for opportunities to invest in climate-related AI, as well as adjust government-procurement policies that could harness its benefits. For example, over the last few years, the EU government has been proactive in generating funding for AI-related projects.323 The U.S. government has also taken steps toward a more active role in AI use and development.324 Over the last ten years, the Department of Energy has invested billions of dollars into new energy infrastructure that interfaces with AI technology to improve energy efficiency.325 Public utilities  317.

Accountability, Safety, and Certification A last area of concern is accountability, safety, and certification. This involves at least two components. First, it demands caution to prevent entities from labeling everything as \u201cAI\u201d to qualify for funding, cost recovery, and general acceptance. Second, processes need to be in place to ensure that AI is performing as expected, which may demand more explainable AI. At present, it is extremely difficult to perform \u201cquality control\u201d on AI before we set it loose on the power grid as no one can fully predict how it will perform.328 Each of these concerns is addressed below. Avoiding AI-Washing. The first concern is that of \u201cAI-washing.\u201d Much like whitewashing329 and greenwashing,330 it is imperative that AI not be used as a catchall for all matters involving data processing. AI has been around since the 1950s, and yet it has come through its AI winter331 in full bloom. As AI has moved from relative obscurity to common parlance,332 it now carries a certain cache that many can use to their advantage.333 Some suggest that people use the  326.

And should entities try to squeeze their activities into an \u201cAI\u201d box when that designation is questionable, it could cast doubt on valid AI. One solution to this concern may be to elicit the assistance of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Although explainability is imperative where AI is making decisions that affect an individual\u2019s freedom, explainability is important for electric-sector AI as well. As one national laboratory researcher stated, \u201cwe don\u2019t know exactly how a neural network selects from the inputs and comes to the final decision because there is so much complicated processing to reach that decision.\u201d343 Another researcher has suggested that \u201c[t]he need for trials to validate reliability is a major reason [machine learning] and AI have seen little deployment\u201d in the electric-power sector.344 For AI in energy and other climate sectors to gain public and private acceptance, its transparency will need to be enhanced, allowing those who rely on it to better understand why the algorithm reached the predictions it did, remain open to criticism, disclose unknowns, and allow for remediation of troublesome training data. This Part does not suggest these are the only tradeoffs. In fact, given the space constraints of an Article, they barely scratch the surface of the depth of the issues that will need to be addressed to more thoroughly use AI to address climate challenges. But acknowledging and addressing the environmental, privacy, investment, and accountability implications of climate-related AI are a good starting place for further discussion.

As the world continues to eat away at the carbon budget set to keep us on course for a 1.5\u00b0C-degree warming of the Earth, we must continue to engage in a multifaceted strategy.

Urban areas are continuously growing, both in terms of inhabitants and occupied space, at a rate of 10,000 square meters added every minute (every year, equivalent to the total size of Japan). By 2021, cities will cover 3% of the Earth's surface, but they will account for two-thirds of global energy demand and 70% of CO2 emissions (European Commission. Joint Research Centre. Institute for Energy and Transport., 2015). To address climate change and related environmental risks, coupled with the recent threat of the energy crisis, the European Union has set a series of goals for its member states. The Green Deal outlines the long-term goal to achieve zero CO2 emissions by 2050, preceded by an intermediate phase of a 55% reduction by 2030 (European Commission. Directorate General for Research and Innovation., 2020). The European Commission entrusts cities with a key role towards climate neutrality. As such, they have been propelled and accelerated through the EU's mission \"100 climate-neutral cities by 2030\u2014by and for the citizens\" (abbreviated as \"Cities Mission\"), part of the Mission Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities (European Commission. Directorate General for Research and Innovation, 2021), introduced by the Horizon Europe program. On April 28,    2022, the Commission announced the 100 chosen cities that will receive the Commission's support to achieve the goal of being climate-neutral and smart by 2030, aiming to make them innovation hubs and benchmarks for the rest of European cities. Recognizing the massive carbon footprint of cities and the targets set to reduce it, there's a need to support cities in speeding up their green and digital transformation since climate mitigation heavily relies on urban actions. So, while climate objectives are set at national and supranational levels, urban-level governments and decision-makers are directly involved in their realization. The city community, being the end recipient of local policy strategies and measures, must adapt to the changes they bring about. Cities must grapple with this responsibility, but also with unique opportunities provided by various funding programs, with potential benefits not only for energy/climate matters but also for livability, overall urban efficiency, health, and citizens' quality of life (Vivi et al., 2019). Cities can be pioneers in reducing emissions and air pollutants by leveraging synergies across different sectors of the urban energy system and harnessing new technologies supporting the energy transition available today. New methods and inventories for assessing CO2 emissions at the city level have been developed to help decision-makers define actions and strategies to achieve decarbonization goals (Fuller et al., 2020). However, focusing solely on the energy sector isn't enough to ensure a carbon-neutral transition: connecting and combining the sectors of transportation, heating, cooling, water management, and waste is vital. This results in a large number of factors and variables at play and a high level of complexity. Over the past hundred years, the energy sector has played an indispensable role in fueling both the manufacturing and service sectors of worldwide economy. Its influence has been paramount in driving economic and societal progress, consequently uplifting the living standards, despite the unpredictability of the global market. Therefore, refining the efficiency and sustainability of our energy systems has always been at the forefront of global attention. Highlighting this commitment, the sustainable development goals (SDGs) laid down a roadmap with seventeen specific objectives to enhance human development. Among these, the seventh goal prioritizes the creation of energy systems that are not only sustainable and innovative but also affordable and reliable (Imbulana Arachchi & Managi, 2021) However, the past two decades have seen the looming shadow of climate change, primarily driven by the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from fossil fuel utilization, including coal, oil, and natural gas. This has presented a monumental challenge to the world's energy strategies (B. Chen et al., 2019). Despite the global community's earnest efforts to pivot towards sustainable energy solutions, a significant portion of the world still relies heavily on carbon-intensive and Introduction 3  polluting energy infrastructures. An undeniable correlation exists between rising energy consumption, economic growth, and surges in CO2 emissions. While there has been a notable reduction in CO2 emissions with the increased adoption of renewable energy (RE) sources, the complete replacement of fossil fuel-based energy seems distant (Renewables REN21. Global status report., 2018). This urgency to tackle climate change and the associated CO2 emissions has necessitated a global shift in energy policies, focusing on mapping out feasible routes to a sustainable energy transition. Indeed, we are witnessing these shifts globally. Historical reviews over the past decade have highlighted the evolution of energy transitions, especially in regions like Europe and the United States (Gales et al., 2007). With these transitions comes the need for innovative energy modeling, which bridges the gap between novel energy infrastructure, policy formation, ecological impact, and energy supply security. The overarching goal remains managing the balance of costs, advantages, and challenges during this transition to ensure sustainability. In response, several governments are fortifying their commitment to this cause. For instance, the European Union (EU) has pledged to achieve a net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emission economy by 2050. Similarly, post the Paris Agreement, China has marked 2030 as its milestone year for peak emissions (Deloitte, 2020). One focal point of this global shift is \"decarbonization,\" a term emphasizing the continuous reduction of carbon intensity in energy over a period. The consensus among experts is clear: transitioning to renewable energy sources is pivotal for effective decarbonization. Numerous countries are taking leaps in this direction, with nations like Paraguay, Norway, and Costa Rica already garnering significant portions of their energy from renewable sources (Kroposki et al., 2017). While 2015's COP211 in Paris was a landmark event setting global decarbonization objectives, it was the subsequent COP22 in Marrakech, hailed as \u201cthe COP of action\u201d, that paved the path for their practical implementation. Among the multiple objectives set during COP21, two were directly tied to energy decarbonization: Goal 7, ensuring universal access to sustainable energy, and Goal 9, focusing on sustainable industrialization and innovation (Di Silvestre et al., 2018). Parallel to these energy discussions, the dawn of the digital age ushered in the fourth industrial revolution. \"Digitalization,\" as defined by Gartner, embodies  1 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It took place in Paris, France, from November 30 to December 12, 2015. The conference is most notably recognized for the resulting \"Paris Agreement,\" a global pact where participating countries agreed to undertake efforts to combat climate change, primarily by aiming to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Paris Agreement represents a significant international commitment to address the challenges posed by climate change.    the transition to a digital-centric business paradigm, leveraging digital tools for new revenue streams and value creation. This digital shift in the energy domain is accelerating, exemplified by the adoption of innovative digital tools like smart meters, state-of-the-art control systems, artificial intelligence, and the revolutionary \"Digital Twin\" concept (Gonzalez et al., 2023).  1.2 Green and Digital Challenges  The built environment, which comprises the sum total of human-made structures in our landscapes\u2014from residential and commercial edifices to infrastructure systems\u2014plays a pivotal role in determining the environmental and climatic well-being of our planet. Historically, the construction and operation of these structures have been among the leading contributors to global carbon emissions. With buildings alone accounting for nearly 40% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions when considering their entire lifecycle, it becomes evident that the built environment remains at the heart of the climate crisis conversation (International Energy Agency, 2022). This significant carbon footprint is the result of multiple factors (Figure 1) energy-intensive construction processes; the extraction, processing, and transportation of building materials; and the ongoing energy consumption during a building's operational phase. Traditional construction methods, often reliant on non-renewable resources, coupled with inefficient operational systems in older buildings, have exacerbated energy consumption patterns. As a result, we find a scenario where the growth in urban landscapes, essential for socio-economic reasons, seemingly works counterintuitively to global sustainability goals.   Figure 1. Building Construction Industry and Other Construction Industry represent emissions from concrete, steel and aluminium for buildings and infrastructure respectively. Architecture 2030. All Rights Reserved. Data Source: IEA (2022), Buildings, IEA Introduction 5  However, as concerns about the climate crisis intensify, there's been a concerted push towards reimagining the built environment. Central to this transformation is the idea of sustainable construction and operations. The overarching objective is to minimize the environmental footprint at every stage of a building's lifecycle. This approach calls for a harmonious amalgamation of advanced technologies, innovative practices, and an acute awareness of environmental needs. As stated by the C40 network, a network of mayors from almost 100 leading global cities collaborating to undertake necessary actions to address the climate crisis, one of the main accelerators of the transformation path of cities towards greater resilience and better adaptive and mitigation capacities is \"clean construction\"2. This refers to the evolution of the global construction industry towards sustainability, efficiency, quality, and equity (Marco Casini, 2022). In fact, construction is one of the sectors most responsible for the global climate crisis, as it contributes to over 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions Figure  2. Construction materials and the building sector are also responsible for over 30% of global resource consumption. The impact of the construction industry is set to increase with the rising need for new buildings and infrastructures: by 2025 we will need to build 1 billion new homes. Globally, about 60% of buildings that will exist by 2050 have yet to be built. This means building a city the size of Stockholm or Milan (1.5 million people) every week until 2050 or a city the size of Singapore or New York every month until 2050 (C40 Cities, 2023).  Figure  2. Total GHG emissions by sector (MtCO2e) (rounded data). Data source: EFA (GHG trends, GHG estimates, UNFCCC reporting) The construction sector is also a key component of economic and employment growth in Europe, contributing significantly to the GDP and employing over 11 million people (European Commission. Joint Research Centre. Institute for Energy and Transport., 2015). In Europe, the challenge is focused on the rehabilitation and management of the existing building heritage, rather than on  2 The \"clean construction\" principle aims to prioritize the renovation of existing buildings and ensure that new buildings and infrastructures incorporate the principles of the circular economy, starting from the design phase, moving through the choice of materials, the construction phase, and up to disposal/reuse. Moreover, it promotes social equity, the reduction of air pollution, the creation of jobs by investing in sustainable local businesses and educating and retraining workers.

Buildings are long-term assets expected to remain useful for 50 or more years, and it is estimated that 75-90% of today's existing buildings will remain in use until 2050. With a low demolition rate (0.1% per year), a low renovation rate (1.2% per year), and a shift to new, highly energy-efficient constructions (1% additions per year), Europe's challenge mainly concerns energy-efficient renovations and investments in the existing building stock (Buildings Performance Institute Europe, 2016) The European Industrial Strategy3 highlights the need for a greener, more digital, and resilient building ecosystem. Several other European initiatives underline the role of construction in achieving goals such as sectoral renewal, process and economic circularity, adaptation to climate change and mitigation of its effects, employment. Among these are the Renovation Wave, EU Climate Adaptation Strategy, Zero Pollution Action Plan, Bioeconomy Strategy, European Skills Agenda for sustainable competitiveness, social fairness, and resilience. The digitization of the construction sector is identified as a key element to enable development that contributes to the aspects listed above. According to the Industry 5.0 approach, digital technologies provide a new paradigm for production in general, and construction in particular (European Commission. Directorate General for Research and Innovation., 2020). It is based on four fundamental components: People, Collaboration, Sustainability, and Technology. This approach offers a vision of the industry that goes beyond efficiency and productivity as the only objectives and reinforces the role and contribution of the industry to society (European Commission. Directorate General for Research and Innovation, 2021). In this context, the potential and transformative implications of digitization for the construction ecosystem are significant: \uf0b7 Digitization bridges the different scales of the built environment: starting from data on individual components, moving to the building scale, information can then be transmitted and incorporated into building production processes up to urban planning; \uf0b7 Digitization bridges different professionals, as well as between workers and users: design work and construction sites can become more collaborative, while the management of a building, asset, neighborhood, or city can be optimized; \uf0b7 Digitization can help create trust and transparency and improve decision-making in building construction processes and urban planning. The deployment of these potentials will be facilitated by the full diffusion of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and tools for collaborative data-driven  3https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-industrial-strategy_en. European Industrial Strategy. Introduction 7  design, and, in the longer term, by Digital Twins (DTs), automation and robotics, and, more generally, by data-driven tools and services that exploit the latest advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensors, cloud computing, massive Big Data processing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). In recent years, European and national initiatives have been launched, reference frameworks drafted, and roadmaps drawn up to support the digitization of the construction ecosystem. In addition, existing financing instruments have been strengthened and new ones created. However, construction remains one of the least digitized sectors in the EU, and the application of digital technologies follows a traditional value chain. The analysis conducted by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission confirms that architectural and engineering design activities for buildings and infrastructure increasingly use digital tools, while their adoption is still very limited in the construction and maintenance phase (European Commission, 2019). Low digitalization rates are also found in the public sector, especially in administrative processes related to construction and medium and long-term strategic planning. For these, it is essential to rely on up-to-date databases, predictions, simulations, monitoring, and interactions with citizens and stakeholders based on transparency and clarity of communication. Therefore, in the context of the general need to digitize content, materials, and processes, DTs also represent a strategic technological innovation for cities (Federico Cinquepalmi, 2019). Within the age of digitization and enabling technologies, which have now emerged as invaluable allies in the fight against carbon emissions in the built environment, digital tools and platforms, combined with innovative construction methodologies, offer the potential to drastically reduce energy consumption and resource wastage. Building Information Modeling (BIM) stands out as a game-changing technology in this domain. BIM allows architects, engineers, and construction professionals to collaboratively design, visualize, and simulate a structure's performance in the digital realm long before its physical construction (Khan et al., 2021). Through such early-stage virtual analyses, inefficiencies can be identified, optimized designs can be conceptualized, and sustainability can be integrated as a core principle rather than an afterthought. Moreover, BIM's ability to integrate energy simulations ensures that energy performance is central to design considerations, leading to inherently more efficient structures (Murtagh et al., 2020). Additionally, the deployment of sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) devices in modern structures ensures continuous monitoring of energy consumption, waste    generation, and resource utilization (X. Li et al., 2022). This real-time data, when fed into advanced analytics platforms, can provide insights into areas of inefficiency, allowing for prompt remedial actions. It facilitates a feedback-driven approach to building operations, ensuring ongoing optimization and reducing the carbon footprint in the operational phase (S. Tang et al., 2019a). The rise of Smart Buildings, empowered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), heralds a future where structures are not just passive entities but are actively engaged in reducing their environmental impact (J. Zhang et al., 2015). They autonomously adjust heating, cooling, and lighting systems based on occupancy patterns and external environmental conditions, leading to considerable energy savings. Moreover, these buildings integrate renewable energy sources, like solar panels and wind turbines, into their energy matrices. Advanced algorithms ensure optimal utilization of renewables, reducing reliance on grid energy that often has a significant carbon footprint. However, the digitization wave doesn't stop at individual structures. On a broader scale, the concepts of Smart Cities look to transform entire urban landscapes into hubs of sustainability (Deng et al., 2021). In this scenario, Digital Twins (DT) which are digital replicas of physical entities, are being created for entire cities (J. Zhang et al., 2015). These digital counterparts allow urban planners and policymakers to simulate various scenarios, analyzing potential strategies for reducing carbon emissions on a city-wide scale. It's an approach that integrates micro-level efficiencies of individual structures into a macro-level strategy for urban sustainability. Beyond technological advancements, the shift towards sustainable built environments requires a change in mindset. Green certifications and sustainability benchmarks are driving this change, with numerous structures now aiming for certifications like LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) or the BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) (Gauthier & Wooldridge, 2012). Such certifications provide tangible goals for builders, designers, and owners, ensuring that sustainability is ingrained in modern structures.  1.2.1 Key enablers and benefits of digital transformation  The ongoing digital revolution, frequently named the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0), is being propelled by the rapid growth of computing capacities and the influx of data (Reischauer, 2018). Digital technology integration into various sectors has been a topic of discussion in numerous industry studies for a while. Yet, the Mckinsey Global Institute recently highlighted an intensified acceleration in digitization, driven in part by the Introduction 9  global pandemic4. This acceleration has seen revenues double from prior projections made before COVID-19. Mobile and cloud technologies have seen a massive upswing in their adoption, a trend that is projected to continue as economies go towards recovery. In this scenario, cyber-physical systems offer a promising avenue, with their potential to save time and costs, paving the way for a more resilient economic built environment (Sepasgozar, 2020). However, the integration of Industry 4.0, amplified remote work capabilities, enhanced supply chain integration, and increased transparency in business processes and might be the catalysts that push resilient companies to thrive in a post-pandemic environment (Rani et al., 2022). Pioneering business paradigms are centering on digitalization, which spans across products, processes, and resources. Taking the construction sector as a case in point: there is a growing inclination towards the Digital Twin (DT), seen as a refined progression from Building Information Modeling (BIM), serving as a catalyst for industry metamorphosis. This shift towards digital solutions is projected to bolster the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) market's valuation from $7.188 million in 2020 to an impressive $15.842 million by 2028, with an annual growth rate of 10.7% from 2021 to 2028 (Allied Market Research., 2021). The profound shift towards digital innovations provides a glimmer of optimism for industries like construction, suggesting that weathering the COVID-19 storm might result in amplified productivity in forthcoming years. For industries across the board, digital mechanisms are vital, from health monitoring and contact tracking to ensuring on-site safety. Concurrently, cloud technologies and mobile platforms foster remote collaborations among designers and builders and allow for swift recalibrations in supply chains. Among the new technologies, Digital Twins (DT) are emerging as strategic tools to guide and inform data-driven decision-making processes. They enable the utilization of the vast amount of machine-readable data produced by the physical city, monitoring trends and consumption, detecting dynamics, and simulating future scenarios. At the heart of recent debates and scientific research, the concept of DT has been discussed in literature rapidly increasing in both the number of contributions and the breadth of related topics. Saeed et al. summarize the potential of DTs \"in enabling a new perspective for understanding, interacting with, and responding to our living system. This opens novel dimensions in multidisciplinary research areas that can redefine the way we perceive and interact with the city. These new methods of planning, management, and operation have the potential to enhance the living experience,  4 McKinsey & Company. How COVID 19 Has Pushed Companies over the Technology Tipping Point Final.pdf. 2020. Available online: https://www.mckinsey.com    efficiency, and performance of the city, its urban realm, and the built environment in general\"(Saeed et al., 2022a). Recently, pilot projects, proofs-of-concept, and applications of DT in various areas have proliferated, and several research groups are working to highlight, categorize, and group the various use cases (White et al., 2021). Thanks to these studies and prototypes, the maturity level of DT is gradually evolving, demonstrating its potential and helping to gain the consensus of key stakeholders and decision-makers in the field of urban policies, planning, and the construction sector. Simultaneously, scientific research and practical experiments are also highlighting limits, risks, and open issues related to the enabling technologies of DT and the production/management of the data needed to power such technologies.  Traditionally, sectors such as consumer goods manufacturing have pioneered the path to digitization, often outpacing the construction industry. Now, leading digital advancements, namely Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Digital Twins (DT), are steering the construction domain towards a new era of data interoperability. While BIM serves as the cornerstone, encapsulating both geometric data and non-geometric attributes vital to construction processes (Sacks et al., 2018), DT extends this capability by integrating BIM's static blueprints with dynamic real-time data, offering a multifaceted view of the built environment, allowing simulations and insights (Schleich et al., 2017). BIM's pivotal influence in the construction realm is underscored by its adaptability, with applications spanning the entire building lifecycle \u2014 from the nascent design phase to the more mature operations and maintenance stages. Building Information Modeling (BIM) serves as an innovative and cohesive platform that archives comprehensive building data. This documentation is pivotal in bolstering the planning, construction, and subsequent maintenance spanning a facility's lifespan (Volk et al., 2014). Intricately designed, BIM goes beyond the traditional confines of 3D computer-aided design (CAD) by assimilating supplementary data encompassing building specifications, chronological scheduling, financial approximations, and maintenance oversight, often referred to as 4D, 5D, and 6D dimensions respectively (Wong & Fan, 2013). The foundational objective behind is to mitigate unnecessary expenditures by precluding discrepancies and miscalculations during the design and construction phases. Presently, the utility of BIM spans across diverse sectors, prominently in architecture, construction, engineering, and facility management (AEC/FM). It plays a crucial role in tasks such as design visualization, ensuring design coherency, detecting inconsistencies or clashes, adhering to lean construction principles, accurate cost and time prognostications, and in fostering heightened collaboration and transparency amongst stakeholders (Volk et al., 2014). Introduction 11  Contemporary endeavors are channeling efforts to augment BIM's capabilities by integrating real-time data streams from sensors and other IoT devices (S. Tang et al., 2019b).  Moreover, the rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has been significantly influenced by Moore's law, which postulated that the number of transistors on semiconductor chips would double approximately every two years, leading to enhanced computational capabilities at diminished costs (Chui et al., 2010)This evolution of IoT stands poised to reshape multifarious facets of the global economy. This transformation is evident in myriad developments ranging from connected and self-driven vehicles (E.-K. Lee et al., 2016), aerial drones or 'flying robots' (Hossein Motlagh et al., 2016), to smart home ecosystems (M. Wang et al., 2013). Fueling this transition is a symbiotic partnership between prominent appliance manufacturers and tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.  Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and data analytics converge to form the foundational pillars of the digital twin creation (Tao, Cheng, et al., 2018). When envisioning a building\u2019s digital twin, one might either extrapolate a 3D CAD model from the existing BIM or fabricate a distinct 3D representation of the structure in question. By weaving together an array of sensor networks, the digital twin offers a vivid, real-time portrayal of the asset. This dynamic perspective paves the way for instantaneous analytics, insightful decision-making, and the enhancement of building efficiency and occupant comfort. Traditional BIM architectures do not inherently accommodate real-time data and predominantly serve design, construction, and maintenance operations, areas which do not generally demand real-time insights (Bruno et al., 2018). On the other hand, the digital twin embodies the real-time essence of a tangible asset. Its modus operandi centers around real-time data, predominantly fed by sensor systems. This data serves to chronicle and monitoring the instantaneous structural and environmental of an asset. Such a mechanism is pivotal for rendering accurate digital twin simulations and insightful data analytics (Qi & Tao, 2018a) Over the years, the Digital Twin (DT) paradigm has been embraced across various industries as a strategy to mitigate asset risks, enhance traceability, and optimize maintenance, ultimately extending the asset's lifecycle (Hlady et al., 2018). DTs can be pivotal in numerous asset-related areas, from singular asset performance to intricate systems like manufacturing processes, wherein multiple components interact uniquely (Shubenkova et al., 2018).  For instance, a survey, as illustrated in Figure 3, highlights that the manufacturing sector is at the forefront in DT research and implementation.      Figure 3. Digital Twins in industries Following closely are sectors related to gas and oil extraction, wind turbine management, typically associated with offshore infrastructures. The construction and aeronautical industries are also significant adopters of DT. It's noteworthy that within this context, diverse case studies, be it buildings or bridges, are all categorized under construction. These industries often have a robust R&D investment tradition, possibly driven by stringent safety mandates, which necessitate considerable expenditure on maintenance activities. This paradigm shift in embracing the digital era holds transformative implications for the Built Environment (BE). As we move forward, a vision of BE surrounded by digital technologies and propelled by data is not just an aspiration but a real objective. This transformation is underpinned not only by a drive to elevate the digital and physical scaffolds of BE but also by the need to contain the ecological footprint. Taking the UK as a case in point, the nation's strategic blueprint is veering towards rejuvenating pivotal sectors by tapping into the untapped reservoirs of digital innovation and the surging streams of big data. This seismic shift isn't just a superficial overlay; it aims to enrich the very core, augmenting the value extracted from myriad services ingrained within BE.  In this scenario, schools and hospitals, not just brick-and-mortar establishments, are interconnected entities, responsive to real-time needs and adaptable to changing scenarios, as well as transportation networks, not merely routes connecting points A to B, but also dynamic systems, optimizing flows based on real-time data, ensuring efficiency and sustainability. Energy systems are not rigid frameworks but flexible matrices, responsive to fluctuating demands and adapting seamlessly to offer optimal output. This is the promise the digital era Introduction 13  holds for the BE, where innovation doesn't just streamline processes but fundamentally reshapes the very way we conceive and interact with our environment.  The digital transformation of the built environment (BE), when synergized with a unified management strategy for the cyber and physical realms, promises to offer several benefits to society. According to demographers' predictions, the world's population is set to rise to about 9.8 billion by mid-century (European Commission. Competence Centre on Foresigh, 2022). Nearly 70 percent of this population increase is expected to be concentrated in urban centers. This change will bring complex challenges, including increasing energy consumption and intensifying vehicular traffic jams (United Nations. Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2018). However, the contrast between the size of the construction industry and its digital competence reveals a paradox. Despite its colossal scale, the sector's digital advances appear nascent, especially when compared with those of other industries. This digital chasm is not only emblematic of the heterogeneous technological terrains that characterize regions like Europe. It underscores the innate complexities and resistance to transformation inherent in the construction ecosystem. The fusion of academic research and real-world observations reveals a growing awareness of the indispensability of digital integration and a comprehensive elevation that strengthens operational efficiency, supports environmental protection, and reinforces safety protocols. This vision recognizes the profound ripple effects that seemingly minor changes in industrial practices can propagate in global economic landscapes and environmental paradigms.  Table 1.

Despite its cutting-edge nature, the Digital Twin (DT) model has its limitations. While it offers insights from extensive data, human intervention is still crucial in final decisions. There are challenges, like software issues that disrupt data transfer or problems syncing real-time data. The ultimate goal for DT is to perfectly blend the digital with the physical, creating a space where virtual and real worlds inform each other. Efforts are underway to integrate DT into the future plans of cities. The development of DT-focused cities showcases this progress. Though they might not solve all urban problems, the benefits they offer across various sectors are undeniable. These benefits stem from combining Virtual Reality (VR), the Introduction 15  Internet of Things (IoT), and detailed 3D modeling, all enhancing the effectiveness of smart cities. Digital Twins are now a growing feature in city planning worldwide. By 2020, an impressive 118 cities had incorporated DT into their urban plans, leading to initiatives like reducing carbon footprints and better traffic management. The potential of DT for cities is immense, and everyone eagerly awaits their broader impact (Lehtola et al., 2022). Yet, developing a smart city is complex. Balancing people's changing expectations, the appeal of new technologies for better governance, and the need for proactive solutions is challenging. That's where DT shines as they're great at spotting potential issues and preventing them. Comparing this foresight with actual results turns data into valuable, actionable insights.  1.2.2 The journey from green production to advanced distribution In Italy the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP)5 encouraged esteemed research entities, chiefly ENEA, the Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy, and Sustainable Economic Development, the primary institution for research, technological innovation, and advanced services in the fields of energy, environment, and sustainable economic growth in taking the lead in championing advancements in the realm of renewable energy. Their efforts span across the spectrum of thermal solar to energy-efficient technologies like photovoltaic, bioenergy, and bio-refineries tailored for energy generation. There\u2019s also an emphasis on constructing smart cities, ensuring judicious energy consumption, pioneering smart grid systems, propelling sustainable transit mechanisms, and formulating cutting-edge thermal cycles and fuel cells (Ministry of Economic Development, 2019). The overarching theme remains the integration of robotics, ICT, and pivotal digital innovations. Central to the NRRP is the emphasis on pioneering computational infrastructure and advanced data transmission frameworks. Such strides will supercharge research hubs, propelling them to lead in realms like cloud-based computing, model-driven solutions, and applications tethered to the vast  5 The PNRR, Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza, translates to the National Recovery and Resilience Plan in English (NRRP). Introduced in response to the economic and social challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, this strategic initiative aligns with the broader European Recovery and Resilience Facility. The primary objective of the Plan is to stimulate Italy's economic recovery, focusing on several pivotal areas: digitalization, innovation, competitiveness, cohesion, education, and health. The plan aims to modernize Italy's infrastructure, promote green initiatives, and ensure a more resilient economy against future shocks. It presents an opportunity not only to repair the damages caused by the pandemic but to reshape Italy\u2019s economy in a sustainable, inclusive, and forward-looking manner.    universe of Big Data and the Internet of Things (IoT). These are seen as essential tools in addressing multifaceted energy challenges. Aligned with EU directives and Italy's long-term blueprint for curbing greenhouse emissions, the aspiration is to drastically slash greenhouse gas emissions, anywhere between 80% to 100% by mid-century using 1990 as the baseline. This audacious goal leans heavily on an energy composition dominated by renewables, a sharp curtailing of energy appetite, wide-scale electrification, and a significant boost in hydrogen production. The plan also underscores the criticality of digital tech, energy storage matrices, intelligent grids, and energy conservation across varied sectors. A transformative wave is being observed in power generation facilities, largely driven by an amalgamation of sensor technology and pioneering software applications. These tools are groundbreaking in their ability to detect anomalies and flag potential threats, setting the stage for predictive interventions. The very essence of constant surveillance, enabled by these sensors, ensures real-time detection of performance gaps, leading to enhanced operational efficiency. Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are integrated with voluminous data harvested not just from isolated power plants but from the entirety of a manufacturer's portfolio. Over time, this layer of automation empowers plants to autonomously oversee and refine their operational metrics. This digital metamorphosis isn\u2019t confined to just electricity creation; it also reshapes distribution and commercial paradigms. It paves the way for consumers to demystify their consumption economics and equips entities like ESCOs and aggregators to curate bespoke offerings by leveraging data platforms. The surging digital integration in metering and home automation equips enterprises to harness data for granular customer insights. Yet, it's a double-edged sword. While companies can tap into vast data pools for intricate customer profiling, consumers, armed with granular consumption insights, can engage more proactively in the marketplace. However, the digital footprint of energy ecosystems isn't without its challenges. Cybersecurity looms large as a significant concern, with the potential to compromise individual privacy. Notably, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has embarked on a mission to digitalize energy infrastructure, with the dual objectives of fortifying resilience and championing decarbonization (International Energy Agency, 2022). Companies are harnessing digital levers to optimize operations and cultivate a more interconnected energy ecosystem. A testament to this is the skyrocketing investment in digital tech within the electric sector, clocking in at an astounding $47 billion in 2016. By 2040, the anticipated annual savings for stakeholders are Introduction 17  projected to be $20 billion. Ultimately, the goal is to harmoniously integrate renewable sources, ensuring networks can seamlessly calibrate their energy offerings to fluctuating demands. The energy paradigm shift is not just about green energy production. It's a holistic transformation anchored in digitalization that encompasses all stakeholders, from energy magnates to the end consumer. The European Commission, in its proactive stance, has wrapped up a public consultation phase, laying the groundwork for a strategic digitalization action plan for the energy domain. This blueprint is geared towards ensuring that digital advancements play a pivotal role in the Green Deal and fostering a unified energy marketplace. However, a collective strategy is needed. The digital energy marketplace must be transparent and competitive, while steadfastly adhering to core tenets: \uf0b7 Ethical governance \uf0b7 Robust data protection \uf0b7 Unwavering commitment to privacy and cybersecurity  Intricacies unique to the energy domain cannot be overlooked. The European Commission, in its initial phases, had circulated a roadmap delineating the challenges and outlining the objectives. The European Union's emphasis is clear in the digital energy action plan. As the EU Executive articulates, a reassessment is pivotal to ascertain if current mechanisms empower citizens to navigate a digitalized energy marketplace efficiently. The surge in digitalization has, unfortunately, left the energy ecosystem vulnerable to cyber threats, jeopardizing supply security. The entire spectrum of the energy supply chain, right from power plant management to consumer-centric services and intelligent grid systems, is undergoing a digital overhaul. In essence, the energy renaissance pivots on three cardinal pillars: \uf0b7 Greening the electricity generation matrix, \uf0b7 Innovating novel storage modalities, such as hydrogen, \uf0b7 Infusing digital elements to revolutionize energy production, distribution, and consumption paradigms. Digitalization of energy in power plants has been made possible through the integration of sensors and cutting-edge software. This combination aids in detecting anomalies and pinpointing potential risks. As a result, proactive measures can be taken before any damage transpires. This strategy is known as predictive maintenance and is most effective when implemented at times that    don't disrupt regular production activities. Furthermore, the continuous monitoring enabled by these sensors can promptly highlight inefficiencies, thus enhancing the plants' overall performance and efficiency. The most noticeable impact of digitalization is on the networks responsible for transporting and distributing generated electricity. In this realm, electronic meters, often termed \"smart meters,\" serve as the cornerstone. These meters facilitate the creation of smart grids, which in turn ensure efficient management and equilibrium of the electrical system. Such an approach becomes crucial when dealing with intermittent renewable energy sources like wind and solar. They can be seamlessly integrated into the network using this system. Historically, the energy distribution model was predominantly top-down, where energy moved in one direction: from the producer straight to the consumer. However, recent trends indicate a paradigm shift toward distributed generation. This trend allows a growing contingent of minor producers and consumers to contribute electricity back into the network. Data from ENEL (Italian National Board for Electric Energy) suggests that approximately 17% of future investments in networks will prioritize innovations in transmission (i.e., by the Transmission System Operator or TSO) and, more crucially, the distribution (by the Distribution System Operator or DSO) of renewable energy sources. As such, ICT tools employed for these endeavors embrace a data-centric methodology. They harness machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), amalgamated with extensive data sets derived not just from one unit but from every facility under the umbrella of a given producer. Over time, such automated learning systems will empower plants to autonomously monitor their performance metrics and make necessary adjustments.  1.2.3 Digital Distributed Energy Resources (DER) Management As the shift towards sustainable energy intensifies, distributed energy resources (DER) are expanding in scale, variety, and intricacy across the globe. Today's DER-oriented power infrastructure represents a state-of-the-art entity, encompassing a range of equipment with modifiable consumption, localized generation units, and energy storage mechanisms. While DER boasts numerous advantages, they also pose challenges concerning system consistency, dependability, adherence, cybersecurity, among others. For instance, variable outputs from renewable sources, triggered by meteorological shifts, can result in intermittent voltage spikes in the distribution grid and disruptions in relay protection mechanisms; additionally, wind energy units might instigate persistent fluctuations in the electrical grid (Ren et al., 2023). The automation Introduction 19  of DER management necessitates the extensive incorporation of Internet of Things (IoT) instruments, whose inbuilt software is particularly vulnerable to cyber intrusions (Sharma et al., 2020). The intricacy of adequately delineating a power system, particularly in the context of DER, is underscored by the necessity of a great array of heterogeneous models, potentially imposing hefty costs. The pivotal challenge lies in enabling the Digital Twin (DT) to swiftly and accurately mirror intricate, prolonged power distribution processes, which are dispersed over vast regions and influenced by an intricate web of latent technological, socio-cultural, and economic parameters. The models that structure a DT manifest variation both on a horizontal spectrum, referring to the specific components they characterize, and vertically, relating to the particular concerns or perspectives they epitomize. To address this diversity, systems engineering offers an approach via viewpoint-centric DT construction, a technique deeply rooted in the guidelines of the ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 standard (Gharaei et al., 2020). This fosters a synchronized, clear understanding of the system. Moreover, to reinforce the base semantics and sidestep potential variances in the theoretical comprehension within the DT, incorporating a sturdy semantic structure is crucial, as exemplified by the distributed energy ontology framework (Andryushkevich et al., 2019) Delving into the sphere of standardization and aiming for automated model integration, cutting-edge mathematical methodologies based on category theory emerge as an apt solution. Within this analytical paradigm, research efforts are directed towards carving a trajectory for the development of a DT-focused DER control platform that resonates coherently with the previously mentioned benchmarks.  1.3 Research framework Over the past few years, Digital Twins (DT) have firmly established themselves as pivotal tools across a wide spectrum of industries. In the automotive sector, they provide intricate simulations of vehicular operations, allowing for advanced diagnostics and performance enhancements. Manufacturing industries utilize DTs to replicate factory processes, optimizing production lines and predicting maintenance needs, ultimately leading to decreased downtimes and increased output. The aerospace domain leverages DT for simulating flight conditions, ensuring design robustness, and forecasting maintenance, a critical component for safety and efficiency. Moreover, in the healthcare sector, DTs have been transformative. They've enabled the creation of patient-specific digital replicas which aid in tailoring personalized treatments and ensuring the precision of diagnostics. Through these applications, it's evident that the integration of DT    has resulted in enhanced operational efficiency, risk mitigation, and improved decision-making across varied sectors. However, the integration of DT in the AECO domain holds vast potential for the energy sector, enhancing operations through precise data modeling and real-time monitoring. The potential of Digital Twins expands even further when introduced to the built environment, particularly in the realm of energy management. Within the AECO sector, DT can model and predict how energy is consumed, stored, and distributed in real-time. This data-driven approach not only assists in optimizing existing infrastructures but also provides invaluable insights during the design phase of buildings, ensuring energy-efficient architectures. As buildings and structures become more complex, integrating renewable energy sources and adaptive systems, the role of DT becomes even more pronounced. By modeling how different energy systems interact within the built environment, stakeholders can make informed decisions, ensuring sustainability and efficiency while reducing operational costs. At various scales of the energy ecosystem (Figure  4): \uf0b7 Bulk Generation sees the harnessing of large-scale energy sources, where DT can model and predict optimal output levels and maintenance schedules. \uf0b7 Transmission Utility Operations can benefit from DT's ability to forecast transmission bottlenecks and optimize grid flow. \uf0b7 Distribution Utility Operations leverage DT for efficient power distribution, demand forecasting, and grid stability. \uf0b7 Behind the Meter involves the end user's side, focusing on consumption optimization. This encompasses technologies such as: \uf02d PV (Photovoltaic) Systems which can be modeled for peak solar capture times. \uf02d Wind Turbines where DT can simulate optimal blade configurations. \uf02d EV (Electric Vehicle) Charging Stations, predicting and managing peak charging times. \uf02d Batteries for optimizing charge and discharge cycles. \uf02d Heat Pumps and Smart Thermostats for ensuring optimal heating or cooling with minimal energy wastage. \uf02d Microgrids which aggregate and manage these diverse energy sources.  Introduction 21   Figure  4. Digital Twins enabling Electric Grid Reliability, Resiliency and Affordability Microgrids, with their inherent ability to operate autonomously from the main grid, stand out as a quintessential application for DT, especially in the \"Behind the Meter\" context. This term essentially refers to all energy systems and processes that end-users have direct control over, from energy generation, storage, and consumption. Digital Twins can replicate these intricate microgrid systems, providing real-time data on energy usage patterns, storage capacities, and potential grid disruptions. Such a granular level of detail allows for advanced forecasting, ensuring that during peak consumption times or grid disturbances, energy can be efficiently managed, and outages are minimized. Furthermore, DT can simulate different scenarios, aiding in strategic planning and ensuring optimal energy distribution based on varied inputs like weather forecasts, peak usage times, or even unexpected outages. It is at the microgrid scale that the present research particularly sharpens its focus. The beauty of microgrids lies in their ability to operate autonomously, interfacing seamlessly with the main grid or functioning in isolation during disturbances.  Distributed Energy Resources (DER) Management is at the heart of modern energy systems, especially in the context of microgrids. With an array of energy sources, from photovoltaic systems and wind turbines to batteries and heat pumps, the orchestration of these resources is paramount. Digital Twins offer a holistic view of these diverse energy sources, providing a platform where each can be managed in synchrony with the others. This encompasses facilitating effective Demand Response, where energy consumption can be adapted in real-time based on market conditions, and Battery Dispatch Optimization, ensuring that energy storage systems are used efficiently. Beyond these, DTs aid in a    comprehensive approach to Energy Management, balancing energy consumption, storage, and generation, and ensuring that the microgrid operates at peak efficiency. The integration of DT in DER Management represents the future of energy, where data-driven insights guide actions, leading to a sustainable and efficient energy landscape. Through this research framework, the aim is to unearth the vast potentials of Digital Twins in transforming how energy is managed and optimized in the built environment.

Introduction 23   This page intentionally left blank.   24        Chapter 2  Background and Literature Review     2.1 Digital Twin paradigm The digital twin (DT) concept is defined differently depending on the domain context such as manufacturing, automotive, aerospace etc. and it has been recently explored and introduced in the built environment sector (McKinsey Global Institute, 2022) As the DT concept rapidly gained attention and widespread interest, it became a research area for the AECO sector and contributions in literature increased over time after 2016 towards an effective conceptualization. In this regard, in the UK the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC) issued the Data for the Public Good report in 2017, and the Centre for Digital Built Britain (CDBB) introduced The Gemini Principles report in 2018, in order to define policy standards and frameworks for the implementation of digital technologies as an interconnection between society and the built environment (Batty, 2018).  Moreover, the DT concept is also closely related to the domain of smart cities and buildings as it enables predictive insights into a city management approach based on digitalization (Mohammadi & Taylor, 2017), providing big data management capabilities in urban spaces (Oliver, 2018).   25  2.1.1 Definitions and key enablers  Back in 2002, the concept of the Digital Twin model emerged in the world of Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) without an official name (M. W. Grieves, 2005). Shortly after, it received a name, but it went through some changes. Initially, it was called the \"Mirrored Spaces Model\" (MSM) in 2005 (M. W. Grieves, 2005). However, the name evolved into the \"Information Mirroring Model\" in 2006 (M. Grieves, 2006). Finally, in 2011, it became known as the \"Digital Twin,\" a term coined by John Vickers of NASA (Grieves M, 2011). Throughout this evolution of names (Figure  5), it's important to note that the core concept and model remained consistent and unchanged.   Figure  5. Evolution of Digital Twin Concept Later in 2012 it was further evolved in the aerospace industry related to modelling and simulation as it was defined by Glaessgen and Stargel as \u201can integrated multiphysics, multiscale, probabilistic simulation of a vehicle or system that uses the best available physical models, sensor updates and fleet history, among others, to mirror the life of its flying twin. The digital twin is ultrarealistic and may consider one or more important and interdependent vehicle systems\u201d ((Shafto M. et al., 2010); (Tuegel et al., 2011a)). Examining the essence of a Digital Twin (DT) is a valuable endeavor. The Digital Twin Model, as depicted in Figure 6 comprises three fundamental components: \uf0a7 The \"Physical Twin\" on the left side represents an existing or intended physical entity in the real world. \uf0a7 The \"Digital Twin\" on the right side is its virtual or digital counterpart residing in the digital realm.  26  \uf0a7 Facilitating the seamless exchange of data and information between these two counterparts is the \"Digital Thread\".  The concept of the Digital Twin came into being roughly twenty years ago and has since been a recurring theme in the literature. It's important to note that there's not universally accepted and standardized definition at present. The definition tends to vary based on factors such as the specific application area of the Digital Twin, the discipline involved, the scale of the physical element being replicated, and other contextual variables. Regarding this conceptual ambiguity, several interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary investigations have recently commenced taxonomic analyses tracing the gradual development of the Digital Twin concept. Some of these studies are referenced to trace the historical trajectory of the concept.  DTs are widely used by NASA for spacecraft, as well as the U.S. Air Force uses it for jet fighters (Tuegel et al., 2011a). It's also being considered for aircraft health in general. In addition, it's being explored for use in IoT deployment and factory production. Even the oil industry is looking at using Digital Twins for ocean-based production platforms. And in the field of medicine, there's talk of using Digital Twins of humans to improve patient health.  Moreover, many software providers that deal with product development and product lifecycles are adopting the Digital Twin terminology. Big players like Dassault Systems, PTC, Siemens, and General Electric have all embraced the concept and are actively using it in various ways (Ghenai et al., 2022). In Grieves' own words, he affirms that despite the evolving terminology, the fundamental concept of the Digital Twin model has remained remarkably consistent since its inception in 2002. The core idea revolves around the creation Figure 6. Digital Twin concept's fundamental components  27  of a digital information structure representing a physical system as an independent entity. This digital information serves as a 'twin' of the data inherent to the physical system, remaining linked with the physical system throughout its entire lifecycle (M. Grieves, 2016). Many DT definitions are wide spreading over time and several research studies introduced the concept of cyber-physical connection (Haag & Anderl, 2018) (Tomko & Winter, 2019)) and real-world mirroring at different levels from products, assets, buildings (Buckman et al., 2014), districts to national ecosystems (Bolton et al., 2018). While looking at specific definitions of the concept related to process management in the AECO sector, many conceptualizations from different points of view can be observed. Control and monitoring capabilities combined with intelligence skills are some of the main goals for digital twins in the built environment throughout its lifecycle. The Digital Twin Consortium defines it as \u201ca virtual representation of real-world entities and processes, synchronized at a specified frequency and fidelity\u201d introducing the synchronization concept as a fundamental element. The Gemini Principles report provided by the Centre for Digital Built Britain defines the DT as a dynamic model of the physical asset, controlled and operated through real-time sensor data measuring performance. As a recently born concept, DT is often resulting in confusion about its intended uses, performances and outcomes, so identifying the main levels of DT in the built environment could be valuable in obtaining clearer definitions. Digital twinning is generally conceived as virtually simulating the relevant behaviour of physical objects in real-world environments (Hochhalter J.D. et al., 2014) as the main components of a typical digital twin are the physical entities in the physical world, the digital models in the virtual world and the data that tie the two worlds together (Michael Grieves, 2014).  Moreover, many definitions emphasize the concept of synchronisation between the digital and virtual world, such as (Garetti et al., 2012) define DTs as \u201cthe virtual representation of a production system that is able to run on different simulation disciplines that is characterized by the synchronisation between the virtual and real system\u201d. Hereafter, a selection of 31 definitions from research literature are included in the following Table 2 and grouped according to six different key layers which specifically identify the main key points according to the field of interest.   28  Table 2.

Lee et al., 2013)  Moreover, it can be noted that over the past decade, the concept of Digital Twin (DT) has undergone a transformation driven by several factors such as the \u201cexplosion of data\u201d in terms of the exponential surge in data generation from diverse sources such as IoT devices, sensors, mobile phones, social media, and network infrastructure: \uf0a7 Advanced sensing technologies: significant advancements in the capability to detect and digitally replicate physical \"objects\" on a large scale. This is made possible through technologies like Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), photogrammetry applications, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). \uf0a7 Software advancements: the continuous development of software tools and platforms that facilitate the creation and management of Digital Twins. \uf0a7 High-Performance computing (HPC): the availability of high-performance computing resources, enabling complex simulations and real-time data processing.  31  \uf0a7 Machine Learning and AI: the maturation of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, which enhance the analytical capabilities of Digital Twins. In this scenario, the Digital Twin Consortium took a significant step towards establishing a unified foundation for future advancements by releasing the following definitions: A digital twin is a virtual representation of real-world entities and processes, synchronized at a specified frequency and fidelity. Digital twin systems revolutionize businesses by expediting comprehensive comprehension, optimal decision-making, and effective action. Digital twins harness real-time and historical data to encapsulate the digital twin past and present while simulating potential future scenarios. Digital twins are driven by desired outcomes, tailored to specific use cases, fortified through seamless integration, constructed upon a foundation of data, guided by domain expertise, and implemented within the realm of IT/OT systems (Digital Twin Consortium, 2020). Such definitions provide a clear and encompassing understanding of what a Digital Twin entails, highlighting its transformative potential and its reliance on data, expertise, and integration for effective application across various domains. In 2021, (Deren et al., 2021) traced the origins and evolution of the Digital Twin (DT) concept, starting from its inception in industrial design and manufacturing. They also explored how the concept expanded in scale and intersected with the notion of smart cities, thanks to advancements in related technologies. Several systematic literature reviews have delved into the DT paradigm. (Semeraro et al., 2021), (Trauer et al., 2020), and (Barricelli et al., 2019) have contributed to understanding the multifaceted nature of DT. Caprari et al. in 2022, emphasized the multidisciplinary nature of the DT concept, showcasing its intersections with various disciplines and its application in diverse sectors. In his comprehensive overview, Caprari presented a collection of transdisciplinary studies (Caprari et al., 2022), offering a taxonomic analysis of the historical development of the DT concept and its connections to various fields of development and application (Valk, 2020). Lastly, Shahzad et al. (Saeed et al., 2022b) explored the characteristics, challenges, and applications of Digital Twins in the built environment. They compiled a selection of the most notable and widely cited definitions of \"digital twin\" in the literature (Brilakis et al., 2019), (David et al., 2018), (Madni et al., 2019), (B. N. Silva et al., 2020), (Shahat et al., 2021), (Centre for Digital Built  32  Britain, 2019), (Glaessgen & Stargel, 2012), (Y. Chen, 2017), (Arup, 2019), (Boschert & Rosen, 2016b)], providing a synthesis of each to enhance our understanding of this concept's diverse interpretations and applications.  2.1.2 Primary objectives The primary goal of the Digital Twin (DT) is to facilitate remote and real-time monitoring and control of physical assets. The data integrated into the digital representation of the asset serves several critical functions:  \uf0a7 Anomaly detection: it helps in identifying irregularities or deviations from normal operation. \uf0a7 Simulation: the data enables the running of simulations to predict how the asset will behave under various conditions. \uf0a7 Failure prediction: it assists in forecasting potential failures or issues before they occur, enabling proactive maintenance.  This wealth of information is then harnessed to optimize the operations of the asset. It's worth noting that while the initial focus of DT was primarily on real-time monitoring, it has since expanded in scope. Now, DT is also recognized as a valuable tool for building and testing products in virtual environments and supporting design and manufacturing processes.  As illustrated by Dr. Grieves, the concept of Digital Twins encompasses different types, each tailored to specific phases in the system's lifecycle (M. Grieves & Vickers, 2017). Here are the key types (Figure  7):  \uf0a7 Digital Twin Prototype (DTP): the DTP serves as the design version and includes all its variations. DTPs are crucial for complex manufactured products. \uf0a7 Digital Twin Instance (DTI): the DTI represents the Digital Twin of each individual produced artifact. DTIs are created for products where it's essential to maintain comprehensive information about the product throughout its lifespan. Examples include airplanes, rockets, manufacturing floor equipment, and automobiles. \uf0a7 Digital Twin Aggregates (DTAs): DTAs are composite representations that combine multiple DTIs. They provide both longitudinal and latitudinal insights into behavior. Longitudinally, they correlate past state changes with subsequent behavioral outcomes. For instance, this can help predict component failures when specific sensor data patterns emerge. Latitudinally, DTAs enable a learning process, where a small  33  group of DTIs can acquire knowledge from actions and share this learning with the broader set of DTIs.   Figure  7. Key Digital Twin Concepts (M. Grieves & Vickers, 2017) The review of existing literature presented herein introduces the Digital Twins paradigm (Figure 8) focusing on conceptual and process models pertinent to various domains, each tailored to specific use-cases. Furthermore, this review delves into the integration of cyber-physical processes and Internet of Things (IoT)-based technologies, alongside artificial intelligence and machine learnins as essential structural components for the development of Intelligent Digital Twins (IDTs).  Figure 8. Digital Twin paradigm\u2019s main components from literature review  2.1.3 Conceptual models The concept of the Digital Twin (DT) originally had specific applications, such as assessing structural integrity and aiding in monitoring and maintaining physical assets. However, the DT's broad potential, involving the creation of a precise digital replica of physical assets, has garnered interest across multiple sectors and applications. This has led to diverse definitions as researchers explore various possibilities. Authors have expanded their definitions to include additional elements, such as specific hardware or software components, expected behaviors, and the context of DT operation. Some have integrated the DT into specific application frameworks, encompassing potential use-cases and sophistication levels.  34  Several adaptations of the initial DT conceptual model have emerged, better aligning with diverse use-case needs. This review of existing literature suggests the introduction of four primary structural model categories: representative, framework-oriented, interaction-centric and function-driven. \uf0a7 Representative: these models serve as exemplary representations, offering a clear and fundamental understanding of the Digital Twin's structure and functionality. \uf0a7 Framework-oriented: these models are centered around a structured framework, emphasizing the systematic arrangement of components and their relationships within the Digital Twin. \uf0a7 Interaction-centric: these models prioritize the portrayal of interactions and interfaces within the Digital Twin, highlighting how various elements communicate and operate together. \uf0a7 Function-driven: these models revolve around the functionalities and services provided by the Digital Twin, emphasizing its practical utility and application in specific contexts. Within the Representative category, numerous conceptual models closely resemble the original one outlined in the literature (M. W. Grieves, 2019), characterized by minor formal adjustments, additions of components, and more detailed specifications.  For instance, one conceptual model, proposed by (Madni et al., 2019) expands beyond the traditional framework. In this model, the physical asset not only conveys performance, health, and maintenance data but also includes event occurrences and actions. In another approach, (Liu et al., 2021) introduced a conceptual model featuring separate representations for an information model and a decision-making model within the digital asset. Furthermore, communication between the physical asset and the digital asset should encompass data related to geometry, performance, and context. (P. Wang & Luo, 2021) present a representative DT conceptual model that considers the asset's life cycle and use-case descriptions. In this context, the physical asset compiles raw and processed data, process descriptions, and use-case descriptions, while the digital asset incorporates a variety of data models, algorithms, and digital processes. Other examples in this category underscore remote control capabilities and the interaction of users with the DT, where DT capabilities are considered as services. For instance, (Y. Lu & Xu, 2019) propose a conceptual model  35  addressing on-demand manufacturing services, wherein the DT manages a series of physical controllers and interfaces with remote users through cloud services. (Damjanovic-Behrendt & Behrendt, 2019) adopt an alternative approach by defining three interoperability \"managers\" responsible for data exchange and asset control, without specifying the exchanged data. These managers facilitate monitoring, decision-making, and simulations, respectively. Additionally, some conceptual models consider communication among diverse DTs and the ability to simulate these interactions. In summary, this category encompasses a range of conceptual models that build upon and refine the foundational Digital Twin concept to suit various applications and requirements within the built environment. In the context of Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations (AECO), it contemplates integration with Building Management Systems (BMS), identifies various users interfacing with the DT (operators, owners, authorities, and end-users), and underscores the relevance of contextual visualizations due to the asset's location in the built environment. Framework-oriented conceptual models fall into a category that elucidates the structure of Digital Twins (DT) by portraying them as an assembly of diverse models operating within a communication framework. Their focus lies in delineating the assortment of models essential for crafting a precise digital counterpart of a physical asset, which the original DT conceptual model does not explicitly articulate. For instance, (Z. Zhang et al., 2020) present a comprehensive DT comprising models for product definition, geometric shape, manufacturing attribution, behavior rules, and data fusion. Similarly, (Vrabi\u010d et al., 2018) propose distinct models encompassing geometry, environment, dynamics, control, sensors, and machine learning. In a broader context, (Tao et al., 2019) introduce a four-model conceptual framework, embracing geometry, physics, behavior, and rule models. This framework also integrates user services and access to domain knowledge. (Zheng & Sivabalan, 2020a) present a DT concept model featuring three core components: a digital model integrating assets and environment, a computational model for simulations, and a graph-based model organizing interactions among datasets. Notably, this model distinguishes between digital replicas of physical assets and the real environment. (Stark et al., 2019) adopt an approach that explicitly segregates hardware and software components, considering various model types, data, processes, and inter-component communication.  36  In all these models, the effective interaction among diverse models is pivotal for accurately mirroring changes in the physical asset's condition. (Terkaj et al., 2019) introduce a network-configured DT model with nodes for configurator, ontologies, simulation, and visualization. This configuration, enhanced with elements from other models, holds promise for applications in the built environment. For AECO sectors, determining the relevance of models for specific use cases is crucial. The configurator can then select the pertinent models and offer requested services via the visualization node, offering flexibility and adaptability. This modular conceptual model facilitates integration with existing capabilities in AECO, encompassing ontologies, simulations, and contextual visualizations. Interaction-centric DTs are presented as an intermediary that bridges the \"physical space\" and \"digital space,\" uniting digital and physical entities. Unlike the previous models that emphasize DT as a digital replica of physical assets, interaction-centric models focus on its role in enhancing processes rather than assets. For instance, (Zheng & Sivabalan, 2020b) propose a model where the DT acts as an interface linking manufacturers, service providers, users in the physical space, and cloud-based services in the digital realm. Similarly, (Y. Wang et al., 2020) describe a DT that facilitates connections between manufacturing, cloud processing, and physical product inspections during operations. In these models, the specific linkage between physical and digital assets remains implicit. The DT serves solely as a conduit for digital processes to augment physical ones. Unlike the previous models, which prioritize assets, these conceptual models concentrate on processes. This difference poses limitations for AECO sectors, where physical assets hold paramount importance. In contrast, in manufacturing, the focus is often on the manufacturing processes rather than the products themselves. In summary, the higher level of abstraction and the absence of a clear physical-digital correspondence among assets in interface-oriented models may restrict their suitability for AECO use cases. Nevertheless, these models excel in accommodating digital components and services that lack a direct physical counterpart. According to the function-driven conceptual model the user is placed at the core of their structural framework. These models prioritize complex workflows by considering the interactions among processes and people. Services are explicitly modeled, with DTs serving as wrappers for these services. The primary goal is to automate intricate workflows through task orchestration, distinguishing between automation (for single tasks) and orchestration (for multi-step processes across various systems).  37  For instance, (Aheleroff et al., 2021) used a service-based DT conceptual model to orchestrate diverse processes, leveraging various technologies for wetland maintenance scheduling. This involved real-time monitoring, control, and prioritization of maintenance activities. In this model, a supervisor sets goals for an orchestrator, a machine-learning-enabled entity managing multiple DTs. These DTs can represent physical assets or human operators who interface with the orchestrator through their service capabilities. The orchestrator utilizes historical data, synthesizes supervisor-defined goals, proposes solutions, and executes the selected solution. This conceptual model deviates significantly from the traditional DT paradigm, positioning the DT as a component within a larger system where orchestrators and supervisors play crucial roles. It focuses on managing multiple DTs in complex workflows, expanding the DT's use-case beyond its original intent. In the context of Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations (AECO), this model could be applied to manage intricate construction or maintenance operations. Process models provide high-level descriptions of sequential and parallel activities, rules, guidelines, and behavior patterns that lead to desired outcomes. In summary, service-based conceptual models prioritize user-centric, complex workflows with explicit modeling of services. They extend the traditional DT paradigm to accommodate intricate task orchestration. Additionally, process models encompass a variety of activities in DT creation, synchronization, and operationalization, with resource-centric approaches aligning closely with AECO practices.  2.1.4 Process models The DT paradigm encompasses various process models that serve different purposes within the domains of manufacturing and the built environment. These models can be grouped into several categories, including creation, synchronization, asset monitoring, prognosis and simulations, optimal operations, and optimized design. The creation of process models involve the automated generation of DT instances as a DT model is initially defined, and specific DT instances are created for each product to be manufactured. For instance, (K. T. Park et al., 2019) proposed a four-step process for DT creation, involving combining digital components, incorporating manufacturing equipment, importing functional definitions, and visualizing the DT instance in a 3D environment. While these processes are common in manufacturing, they differ significantly from creating Building Information Models (BIM) or geometrical DT models for built assets.  38  DT creation processes focus on functional attributes and relationships among components, which are not typically captured in BIM models. Additionally, the small variations between built assets and the relatively low number of instances make direct translation of manufacturing approaches to the built environment challenging. However, these approaches can support BIM model federation for interdisciplinary assessments in AECO. Synchronization is a fundamental requirement in the DT paradigm, involving two-way data exchange between physical assets and their digital counterparts. Event-based synchronization, proposed by (K. T. Park et al., 2019), aligns different data types with specific events and timestamps, enabling diverse synchronization processes for tracking historical performance, real-time monitoring, and future schedules. In the AECO sectors, such synchronization processes could correspond to obtaining data related to construction progress, current tasks, and future construction plans. The rate of synchronization, known as the \"twinning rate,\" is crucial, with real-time synchronization being vital for Industry 4.0 manufacturing. However, the specific use-case should determine latency requirements, which may not be as stringent in AECO compared to manufacturing. Asset monitoring in the DT paradigm often focuses on performance monitoring to detect faults promptly and facilitate maintenance.  In AECO, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and building services monitoring are predominant. For example, (Davila Delgado & Hofmeyer, 2013) demonstrated the integration of physical and digital infrastructure assets for structural condition data and long-term asset management. In building services, DT process models, such as the one by (Q. Lu et al., 2020), are used for anomaly detection in heating and ventilation systems. These models can be adapted for gradual and abrupt fault detection in various infrastructure and built assets. Prognosis and simulations are essential aspects of the DT paradigm, enabling predictive maintenance and condition-based assessments. Prognostic simulations predict future trends or state changes based on current asset states, while reactive simulations predict future states due to unexpected disturbances. In the AECO context, prognosis and simulations are often carried out at the design stage, focusing on future behaviors rather than current operations. However, DT-based approaches aim to simulate asset operations based on current performance data. Validation of simulations is crucial, though relatively unexplored in the DT context. Optimal operations leverage DTs to optimize complex processes by adjusting parameters within limits to minimize costs or maximize efficiency. There are two main types of process models: those focused on optimizing manufacturing processes and those targeting equipment operation. (Schluse et al., 2017)  39  presented a DT process model for simulation-based optimal operations of complex equipment tasks, which integrates real-world and digital interactions and simulates user interactions. In the AECO context, this approach can optimize the operation of various plant equipment or coordinate large-scale construction activities efficiently. Optimized design using DTs involves two primary approaches. One uses DTs to simulate the performance of physical assets and refine designs based on simulation results. The other leverages historical performance and condition data from physical assets to improve future designs. In AECO, these approaches can be applied to optimize designs based on real-world data and enhance simulations to better align with actual asset performance. The use of evolutionary processes and benchmarking further supports the optimization of designs in the built environment. In summary, the DT paradigm offers a versatile set of process models applicable to various industries, including manufacturing and AECO, with the potential to enhance asset management, performance optimization, and design processes. These models bridge the gap between physical assets and their digital counterparts, offering opportunities for improved efficiency and decision-making.  2.1.5 Cyber-physical processes Cyber-physical security also stands out as a paramount concern as its significance arises from the fact that if the information flowing between the Digital Twin and its Physical Twin is not adequately safeguarded or if the system remains vulnerable to unauthorized access, the Digital Twin becomes a potential source of harm. Even in scenarios where the Digital Twin is primarily responsible for monitoring, the incapacity of the system to shield its data from external breaches poses not only problems but also endangers the well-being of the system's owner or user. To delve deeper into this matter, cyber-physical security entails the protection of interconnected digital and physical systems. In the context of Digital Twins, this involves securing the data exchange and communication between the virtual representation (Digital Twin) and its real-world counterpart (Physical Twin). Ensuring the security of a Digital Twin ecosystem encompasses several crucial aspects: \uf0a7 Data Encryption: employing advanced encryption techniques to scramble data during transmission, making it incomprehensible to unauthorized parties.  40  \uf0a7 Access Control: implementing strict access controls and authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized personnel can interact with the Digital Twin. \uf0a7 Intrusion Detection: employing intrusion detection systems to swiftly identify and respond to any suspicious activities or attempts to breach the system. \uf0a7 Regular Updates: keeping the Digital Twin's software and security protocols up-to-date to patch any vulnerabilities that may emerge over time. \uf0a7 Redundancy: establishing backup systems and data storage to prevent data loss or system failure in case of a cyberattack. In essence, cyber-physical security is akin to safeguarding the Digital Twin's system, ensuring its integrity and reliability. It's a critical concern not only for protecting valuable data but also for maintaining the safety and functionality of the systems that rely on Digital Twins, be it smart cities, industrial facilities, or healthcare systems. Therefore, addressing cyber-physical security comprehensively is critical to harness the full potential of Digital Twins while mitigating risks to individuals and society as a whole. The concept of Digital Twins (DT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) share many similarities, as both describe the integration of digital entities with physical entities. While these terms emerged around the same time, DT in 2005 and CPS in 2006, there is still no universally accepted definition for either. Multiple definitions exist, reflecting the evolving nature of these concepts. For instance, CPS can be defined as systems \"with integrated computational and physical capabilities that can interact with humans through many new modalities\" (Baheti, 2011). Alur describes CPS as \"a collection of computing devices communicating with one another and interacting with the physical world via sensors and actuators in a feedback loop.\" Meanwhile, (Tao, Zhang, et al., 2018) provide a broader definition of CPS as \"multidimensional and complex systems that integrate the cyber world and the dynamic physical world,\" emphasizing the integration of computation, communication, and control of physical processes. The relationship between DT and CPS is still a subject of debate, with three major trends emerging: \uf0a7 DT as an aggregation of CPS concepts: some argue that DT is essentially a repackaging of existing CPS concepts, specifically developed for aerospace and later applied to manufacturing.  41  \uf0a7 DT as a subset of CPS: others view CPS as the overarching term, with DT serving as a subsidiary concept used for specific use cases, such as asset monitoring and maintenance. \uf0a7 DT and CPS as slightly different aspects of the same paradigm: this perspective suggests that CPS focuses more on fundamental scientific aspects, while DT concentrates on practical implementations.  DTs emphasize digital models, while CPS emphasizes computation, communication, and control. Additionally, CPS research emphasizes sensors, actuators, and control, while DT research centers on models and data. To further clarify the comparison between CPS and DT, it's essential to consider their attributes, functions, main use cases, and key differences. Notably, one fundamental distinction is that DT refers to an information construct describing a digital replica of a physical asset and its data connections, whereas CPS refers to a system integrating digital and physical components. This nuanced difference has significant implications. In a DT solution, a physical asset has a corresponding digital replica, allowing for behavior simulation, condition monitoring, and predictive analysis. In contrast, a CPS solution primarily focuses on enhancing control and optimization of physical processes through the integration of digital components without the need for a direct correspondence between the digital and physical elements. Making a comprehensive comparison between Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Digital Twins (DT) in terms of their defining attributes, functions, primary use cases, and key distinctions, CPS can be classified as a scientific category, revolving around integrating physical processes with computer systems, emphasizing communication, computation, and control of sensors and actuators in physical systems. It operates on a one-to-many correspondence basis, allowing one digital system to correspond to multiple physical assets, and it plays a pivotal role in enhancing physical processes through real-time monitoring and control. In contrast, Digital Twins are categorized as engineering tools, focusing on data and digital models, and operate on a one-to-one correspondence basis, where one physical asset corresponds to one digital asset. Digital Twins serve as near-real-time digital replicas of physical products or processes, encapsulating all relevant information throughout their lifecycle phases. The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has ushered in a significant surge in interconnected smart devices (L. Da Xu et al., 2014), (Stankovic, 2014) To ensure the meaningful utilization of these devices, they must possess the capability to capture data relevant to their intended functions. In the context of the built environment, these smart devices may collect a wide array of information, including but not limited to traffic patterns, temperature,  42  humidity, and energy consumption. Depending on their specific design, smart devices can capture essential attributes of objects, enabling the realization of enhanced efficiency and intelligence within cyber-physical systems (CPS). These CPS encompass critical infrastructure systems such as energy, transportation, manufacturing, agriculture, and healthcare (G. Xu et al., 2016), (Mahmud et al., 2017), (Bartolini et al., 2020). Given the vast volume of data generated within these CPS, it becomes imperative to embrace advanced networking, data analysis techniques (e.g., deep learning), and cloud/edge computing technologies within smart systems (Hatcher & Yu, 2018), (D. Wu et al., 2019a), (W. Shi et al., 2016). This strategic approach facilitates the efficient collection, transmission, analysis, and sharing of pertinent data, thereby empowering physical systems with the intelligence required for improved monitoring and control capabilities (Cai et al., 2021). The concept of a Digital Twin (DT) encompasses a data-driven combination of software and hardware that intricately portrays a real physical system, encompassing all of its functionalities, use cases, statuses, and information across various life-cycle phases (Z. Cai et al., 2021b). While integrating DT into Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) offers evident advantages, it introduces a host of challenges in the domains of modeling, computation, networking, and data analysis. Moreover, CPS imposes exceptional requirements related to latency, reliability, safety, scalability, security, and privacy, among others. While advanced networking, computing, and data analysis technologies can contribute to realizing DT, several critical issues need attention. These include defining the theoretical foundations and modeling techniques to ensure the accurate and dependable representation of real-world systems by DT, designing Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models to enable real-time processing of vast datasets, and addressing the security and privacy concerns associated with DT and the collection and dissemination of privacy-sensitive information. To achieve a precise representation of physical systems, a multi-domain and multilevel design approach must be integrated into the lifecycle of these systems. Additionally, comprehensive investigations are required to extend DTs to IoT-based smart systems driven by data science and engineering, given the widespread application of IoT across diverse physical systems.  Existing surveys have examined DT frameworks in industrial systems (Kritzinger et al., 2018), (Danilczyk et al., 2019)and some studies have categorized DTs in the power grid (Tzanis et al., 2020a), (Tzanis et al., 2020b) However, given the extensive use of IoT in various physical systems, a comprehensive examination of extending DTs to IoT-based smart systems is imperative. As a DT system serves as a replicated version of a target physical system, utilizing a model to continuously emulate various functions of the physical  43  counterpart, the DT must establish a connection with the corresponding physical entity, allowing it to gather and update the state of physical components. Consequently, a DT model can not only simulate but also predict, control, optimize, and learn from the real-world entities it represents.   2.1.6 Cybersecurity The integration of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems, in conjunction with the inherent data exchange involved in the creation and operation of digital twins, reveals a complex and evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats. The failure to adequately mitigate these risks poses significant threats to the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of both the digital twin and its associated data (Stouffer, 2023). This necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the various types of threats and the implementation of tailored cybersecurity strategies. Data Integrity Threats: the efficacy and reliability of a digital twin are fundamentally dependent on the accuracy and integrity of the data it receives from its physical counterpart. Any form of data manipulation or corruption can lead to erroneous modeling and analysis, potentially culminating in suboptimal or detrimental decisions. Cyber-attacks that specifically target data integrity, such as Man-in-the-Middle attacks or data tampering, pose a significant threat to the security of digital twins (Alcaraz & Zeadally, 2015). These threats underscore the necessity for robust data validation and verification mechanisms to ensure the fidelity of the digital twin's data. Unauthorized Access: Digital Twins, which often process and store sensitive and proprietary data, are prime targets for cybercriminals seeking unauthorized access. This unauthorized access could be aimed at data theft for industrial espionage purposes or gaining control over the physical systems mirrored by the digital twin (Roman et al., 2013). Implementing stringent access control measures and continuous monitoring for unauthorized access attempts is crucial in safeguarding these digital assets. Malware and Ransomware: as interconnected systems, digital twins are vulnerable to malware or ransomware attacks. Such an attack has the potential to disrupt the operation of the digital twin, or even result in a shutdown of the corresponding physical system (Collier et al., 2014). IT-related Threats: in the IT domain, vulnerabilities can arise from various sources, including network vulnerabilities, inadequate access controls, or the use of outdated systems. Given IT's critical role in transmitting and processing the data utilized by digital twins, any compromise in IT systems can have far-reaching effects on the digital twin's functionality and reliability. Therefore,  44  maintaining up-to-date IT infrastructure and employing comprehensive network security strategies is imperative. OT-related Threats: Operational Technology (OT) encompasses the hardware and software responsible for monitoring and controlling physical devices, processes, and infrastructure, particularly in industrial settings (Boyes et al., 2018). The increasing convergence of OT with IT systems, especially with the adoption of IoT devices, has led to enhanced connectivity but also exposed OT systems to new cybersecurity threats. Compromising OT systems can have direct and severe impacts on the physical systems they control, potentially leading to physical damage and safety hazards. Privacy Concerns: The nature of data processed and stored by digital twins, especially in sensitive sectors like healthcare, raises significant privacy concerns. Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and implementing robust encryption and anonymization techniques are critical in addressing these privacy issues. Given the diverse applications of digital twins across various sectors, a one-size-fits-all approach to cybersecurity is not feasible. Customized cybersecurity strategies tailored to specific applications of digital twins are essential. However, certain general strategies, such as regular system updates, robust access controls, and advanced threat detection mechanisms, can provide a solid foundation for cybersecurity efforts across different implementations of digital twins. In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, the security of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems has become a critical concern, especially in the context of digital twins. Digital twins, as virtual replicas of physical systems, rely heavily on the seamless and secure exchange of data between the IT and OT domains. This introductory section delves into the various strategies and measures necessary to fortify the cybersecurity of both IT and OT technologies. exploring the implementation of network security measures, data security protocols, and regular updates in IT systems, while also addressing the unique challenges posed by OT systems, including legacy systems and network segmentation. Additionally, it is highlighted the importance of addressing privacy concerns introducing Italian Cybersecurity Framework, which provides a comprehensive approach to managing cybersecurity risks in the context of digital twins. This framework, developed by Sapienza University's Research Center of Cyber Intelligence and Information Security (CIS), offers a tailored solution for organizations, particularly small and medium enterprises, to navigate the complexities of cybersecurity in the digital twin environment. Network Security Measures: the integrity of IT networks is critical in managing the flow of data to and from digital twins. To protect these networks, the implementation of comprehensive security measures is essential. This includes deploying advanced firewalls, sophisticated intrusion detection systems,  45  and designing secure network architectures. These measures are pivotal in safeguarding against unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Furthermore, the utilization of encryption and secure communication protocols is imperative to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data, both in storage and during transmission (Keoh et al., 2014). This dual approach ensures a fortified barrier against cyber threats. Data Security Measures: the protection of data associated with digital twins involves securing it during transit and while at rest. This security is achieved through the application of robust data encryption techniques, secure data storage solutions, and regular data backups. Additionally, stringent access control measures are crucial in preventing unauthorized data access (Z. Xiao & Xiao, 2013). These measures collectively form a comprehensive shield, safeguarding critical data against various cyber threats. Regular Updates and Patch Management: the landscape of cyber threats is continually evolving, making regular updates and patch management of IT systems a necessity. This proactive approach is vital in addressing emerging security vulnerabilities and reducing the risk of cyber-attacks. A structured patch management process ensures timely application of updates, thereby enhancing the resilience of the IT infrastructure (Othmane et al., 2019). Securing OT Technologies: OT systems, particularly legacy systems, were often not designed with modern cybersecurity considerations. Their integration with IT systems exposes them to new cyber threats. Developing secure solutions for OT systems, often from the ground up, is a complex yet critical task (Colombo et al., 2016). Network Segmentation: network segmentation is a proven strategy in network security and is particularly effective in securing OT systems. It involves isolating the OT network from other networks, including IT networks, to prevent cross-network breaches. This strategy not only limits the spread of malware but also provides enhanced control over network traffic (Colombo et al., 2016). Regular Security Assessments: conducting regular security assessments is crucial in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in OT systems. These assessments should cover technical, operational, and procedural aspects, allowing for comprehensive risk management (Humayed et al., 2017). Addressing Privacy Concerns: In the realm of digital twins, privacy concerns are paramount, especially given the sensitivity of the data involved. A holistic approach that combines technical measures like data anonymization and encryption with adherence to data protection regulations is essential. Raising user awareness about privacy implications is also crucial in ensuring data privacy.  46  In 2015 Sapienza University (at the Research Center of Cyber Intelligence and Information Security \u2013 CIS) produced the \u201cNational Framework for cyber security\u201d aimed at providing to organizations a homogeneous and volunteer approach to face up cyber security in order to reduce the risk linked to the cyber threat.  The approach of this Framework is strinctly linked to a risk analysis and not to technology standards and therefore can be applied to digital twins. The Italian Cybersecurity Framework derives much from the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (NIST) but has been tailored according to the Italian production context with a specific focus on small and medium enterprises. The National Framework derives from the NIST Framework the basics of Framework Core, Profile and Implementation Tier, adding the priority and maturity levels to the 98 Subcategories of the Framework Core.  The NIST Framework offers a highly flexible framework, which is mostly targeted at crucial facilities; at CIS they developed it according to the characteristics of the social and economic system of our country, reaching a cross-sector framework that can be contextualized in specific production sectors or in company types with specific characteristics, therefore realizing a suitable framework also for DT approaches. In the Cybersecurity Framework, three important concepts have been introduced: 1. Priority Levels: These define the priority associated with each Subcategory of the Framework Core. It is important to note that organizations are at liberty to adapt their priority levels based on their type of business, size, and individual risk profile. 2. Maturity Levels: These describe the various ways in which each Subcategory of the Framework Core can be implemented. Each enterprise must carefully evaluate the selected maturity level in accordance with its business size and risk profile. Generally, higher maturity levels necessitate more significant investment in terms of financial and management resources. It is also worth noting that for some Subcategories, establishing maturity levels may not be feasible. 3. Framework Contextualization: This involves tailoring the Framework to a specific productive sector, business type, or individual business. This process entails selecting the Function, Category, and Subcategory from the relevant Framework Cores and specifying the priority and maturity levels that are most suitable for the specific implementation context. (Roberto Baldoni, 2016).   47  2.1.7 IoT and networking technologies The effectiveness of DT technology hinges on its capacity to ingest vast datasets and derive meaningful insights through advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. This enables real-time forecasting and prediction. For instance, when DT is integrated into manufacturing processes, it can facilitate proactive planning for repair and maintenance activities, thereby mitigating potential failures during manufacturing. To ensure seamless integration between DT and physical systems, it is imperative for the DT to access real-time state information from the physical systems, a feat achieved through the utilization of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and networking technologies.  Figure 9. DT architecture for IoT (Qian et al., 2022) The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices across diverse real-world applications and physical environments has introduced a great challenge associated with the collection, aggregation, storage, and analysis of the data they generate. Figure 9 presents a generic architecture for IoT systems comprising four distinct layers: the object layer, communication layer, application layer, and end-user layer. The object layer encompasses all IoT sensors, serving as the source of data and information for various IoT-driven applications. This layer encompasses all the components that constitute the physical system. Meanwhile, the communication layer furnishes the necessary communication network infrastructure to connect IoT devices and gather data for DTs. For instance, multiple edge gateways can be strategically deployed to collect and consolidate data from sensors, subsequently transmitting this data to the  48  application layer. These IoT sensors and gateways employ distinct communication protocols for data collection and transmission. Upon acquisition of information at the gateway within the object layer, it is forwarded to the application layer, which encompasses the digital systems of the Digital Twins (DT). Within the application layer, the DT system first aligns all sensor and gateway information with the digital model. Simultaneously, an IoT naming service is employed to assign names to the mapped IoT sensors and local gateways. This naming convention enables the digital system to locate various resources (Hatcher et al., 2021). Subsequently, the digital system harnesses Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models for predictive analysis. This allows the digital system to regulate actuators in the target layer based on the outcomes of these predictions. Additionally, the results of prediction and analysis can offer diverse services within the end-user layer. The end-user layer serves as a gateway for user services, allowing users to submit requests to the application layer. Subsequently, the digital system processes the received requests and provides responses accordingly. Within the architectural framework of the Digital Twin (DT) system, data representation and communication protocols assume critical roles in facilitating data sharing within the DT and delivering services to end users.  Data representation is fundamental for enabling system components to comprehend data from diverse domains (Jaloudi, 2019a) (Al-Sarawi et al., 2017a). In the realm of DT, several widely utilized data representation protocols include the DT Definition Language (DTDL) (GitHub, n.d.), FIWARE (Conde et al., 2022), OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) (Ala-Laurinaho et al., 2020), and the Feature-Based DT Framework (FDTF) (Autiosalo et al., 2020). Notably, DTDL, an open-standard platform introduced by Microsoft (GitHub, n.d.), plays a significant role in enabling data transmission within the system and between different systems. The communication protocol plays a crucial role in facilitating information exchange among IoT devices and IoT systems (Jaloudi, 2019b), (Al-Sarawi et al., 2017b). In the realm of IoT, several prominent communication protocols are commonly employed, such as the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) (Kome et al., 2018), the OASIS Standard Message Passing Protocol (MQTT) (D. Silva et al., 2021a), the Modbus TCP/IP Protocol (Cagnano et al., 2020a), and Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) (Tan et al., 2020). A summary of these communication protocols is provided in Table 3.    49  Table 3. IoT communication protocols  Protocol Name Protocol Type Protocol Characteristics DTDL Data Representation As an open-standard platform, it defines six characteristics of IoT components and enables seamless data transmission between different DTs. FIWARE Data Representation It supports DT data transmission and the processing of contextual information received from various IoT components. OPC UA Data Representation As a modeling framework, it can retrieve information from raw data, support data manipulation, and provide monitoring capabilities. FDTF Data Representation As a DT structure, it enables the DT system to share information based on the data link between DT components. CoAP Communication As a specialized web communication protocol based on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), it is tailored for resource restricted devices, supports the transmission of data via Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and provides a publish and subscribe mechanism to simplify the process of obtaining continuous data from the sensor. MQTT Communication As a communication protocol based on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), it enables lightweight way for IoT devices to communicate, provides reliable data transfer, and can establish a long-existing outgoing TCP protocol to enable transmission. Modbus TCP/IP Communication As a communication protocol based on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), it realizes the connection between industrial devices, provides reliable data transfer, and contains built-in checksum protection. URLLC Communication As a communication protocol, it tends to achieve low latency and reliability in the transmission process between IoT devices.   2.1.8 Towards Intelligent Digital Twins (IDT) The synergy between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Digital Twins (DTs) represents a pivotal advancement in various industries, notably manufacturing. Researchers, like (Rathore et al., 2021), have underscored the transformative  50  potential of AI techniques when applied to DTs. By harnessing advanced AI capabilities, DTs can evolve into intelligent systems capable of not only replicating physical processes but also making critical decisions. These AI-powered DTs can excel in tasks such as process optimization, resource allocation, safety and fault detection, predictive maintenance, and real-time decision-making. However, to fulfill these roles effectively, DTs must exhibit qualities like accuracy, robustness, and autonomy. Real-world systems are dynamic, influenced by ever-changing operational and environmental factors. This dynamism necessitates that DT models remain in sync with the current state of physical systems. Challenges arise in maintaining this synchronization due to inherent limitations in modeling and data collection, leading to residual errors. Paradoxically, these errors present opportunities for further progress. The conventional view of DTs portrays them as passive repositories of product information, requiring user-initiated queries for accessing data and predictions. However, a fundamental shift is occurring towards Intelligent Digital Twins (IDTs), marked by their proactive and anticipatory nature. IDTs constantly monitor physical systems, learning from real-time sensor data and optimizing their behavior to align with evolving conditions. This proactive approach relies heavily on machine learning and AI techniques, as noted in (Jaensch et al., 2018) and (J. Wang et al., 2019) These methods empower IDTs to adapt to machinery process degradation, fine-tune parameters, and continuously improve their models. (Sapronov et al., 2018) even employ machine learning for refining DT parameters, while (Maschler et al., 2021) explore cross-phase transfer learning to reduce discrepancies when using real data. (Cronrath et al., 2019) delves into reinforcement learning to correct model and data errors. As described by Grieves, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Modeling & Simulation (M&S) stand as two complementary facets of the digital realm, offering distinct capabilities that, when combined, yield a powerful intelligence for Digital Twins within a virtual realm.  AI is the effort of computers emulating human intelligence, focusing on tasks traditionally associated with human thinking. Conversely, M&S pertains to computers replicating the dynamics of the physical universe, excluding human intelligence. These parallel tracks converge to furnish digital twins with a unique form of intelligence. The bedrock of both AI and M&S lies in the relentless evolution of computing power. Since the early 1970s, the exponential growth of computing performance, epitomized by Moore's Law, has been an instrumental driving force. This steady march forward, as depicted in the logarithmic graph (Figure 6), has witnessed computing performance doubling approximately every 18 months, culminating in the awe-inspiring 54 billion transistor density in 2020. Extrapolating this trajectory, we anticipate a staggering six trillion transistors or equivalent capabilities by 2030. The implications of such computational  51  prowess are profound, ensuring that the concepts elucidated herein will remain unconstrained by computational limitations. Historically, the Digital Twin realm has been one of passivity\u2014a reservoir of product information awaiting user inquiries. This conventional Digital Twin, described as an information repository, functions with users extracting data from it as needed. It serves as a resource for users seeking to minimize physical resource wastage by making informed decisions. The Intelligent Digital Twin (IDT) (M. Grieves, 2022), on the other hand, embodies a paradigm shift by embracing activity. The traditional Digital Twin has often been depicted as a static receptacle of product information, with users initiating requests for specific predictions when necessary. Contrarily, the IDT operates as a dynamic and engaged entity, actively participating in the decision-making process. The essence of this transformation lies in the establishment of bidirectional communication links between the Digital Twin and its virtual surroundings and the Physical Twin and its real-world environment. For the IDT to be active, it must remain in an online state, perpetually scanning the Physical Twin (PT). The IDT's activation pivots from the physical aspect of the digital twin model to its active counterpart. Depending on the lifecycle phase, the physical side encompasses the environment, the physical twin, and the human stakeholders involved. Consequently, the IDT metamorphoses from a passive repository into a proactive one, offering continuous agent assistance. Unlike the conventional digital twin, which primarily relies on human-driven goal seeking, the IDT shares this responsibility with its human users. A defining attribute of the IDT is its anticipation, mirroring a human trait. The Future-Running Simulation (FRS) (M. Grieves, 2022) is a concept defined by Grieves to explain this anticipation capability, constantly simulating complex products within the digital twin. Leveraging the exponential advancements in computing power, the IDT can orchestrate multiple scenarios, harnessing Bayesian probabilities to estimate the likelihood of adverse events. This empowers humans to assess and mitigate risks proactively, substantially enhancing decision-making. As we navigate this realm of AI-empowered DTs, the key challenge lies in ensuring the fidelity of the virtual model to the physical system it represents. Imperfections or discrepancies between the two realms can be problematic, necessitating continuous updates and validation before deployment. Assessing the virtual model's confidence and its alignment with real-time data is key. Since physical systems evolve and are influenced by various factors, DT models must mirror this dynamism and adapt to changing conditions. Beyond manufacturing, the combination of Digital Twins and AI holds immense promise in energy management. This synergy can optimize grid operations,  52  reduce human intervention, facilitate intelligent decision-making, and enable forecast-based management models, as shown by (Y. Li & Shen, 2022) Achieving power balance, efficient load management, and microgrid integration are primary goals in power grid optimization, enhancing overall resilience (Bazmohammadi et al., 2022a). Nevertheless, several challenges loom over the successful implementation of AI-empowered DTs. These include the availability of historical data for training machine learning algorithms, data quality and resolution, communication latency, model interpretability and repeatability, and the adequacy of computational resources (J. Guan et al., 2021). In the context of the built environment, the application of Digital Twins has seen substantial interest, particularly in maintenance management and energy performance simulations. However, research in the realm of digital twins for building energy efficiency is relatively nascent, with a limited number of scientific articles and recent publication dates indicating its emerging nature.  This nascent field reveals gaps in areas like data integration systems, complex autonomous decision-making, and data visualization\u2014key aspects to facilitate understanding and interpretation by non-technical stakeholders (Bortolini et al., 2022) Examining the Intelligent Digital Twin (IDT) across its lifecycle reveals two key phases: DT design and DT utilization. Design Phase: during this stage, models are created, and data is gathered and stored. Utilization Phase: this phase consists of three sub-stages: \uf0a7 Setup: parameters are adjusted based on system observations. \uf0a7 Run: the DT performs its functions (e.g., monitoring, decision support) once parameters are validated. \uf0a7 Maintenance: updates and maintenance are conducted to account for deviations. Focusing on the utilization phase, it can be highlighted how AI techniques enhance DT accuracy. In the setup phase, the critical task involves validating and refining the virtual model's parameters to ensure an accurate representation of the physical system. This meticulous process is initiated by human operators due to the initial uncertainty regarding the DT's parameters. The aim is to minimize any disparities between the physical and virtual twins, and to achieve this, artificial intelligence techniques, such as Reinforcement Learning, are employed.   53  In this context, Reinforcement Learning acts as a crucial tool, aligning the two twins by fine-tuning the DT's parameters. This alignment process plays a pivotal role in establishing the foundation for accurate real-time reflections of the physical system within the digital realm, ultimately enhancing the DT's overall efficacy. The Run phase is characterized by the dynamic nature of the DT model, which operates with predefined parameters. During this phase, the DT must continuously ensure that its behavior effectively mirrors the current state of the physical system. To achieve this, it engages in vigilant monitoring and compares the nominal behaviors calculated by the models with observations from the physical twin. Artificial intelligence techniques, particularly Supervised or Unsupervised Learning, are indispensable at this stage. These AI methods have the critical role of identifying unexpected patterns within the dataset.  Algorithms like Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, Principal Components, or DBSCAN are frequently employed to detect anomalies in the data distribution. It is worth noting that human expertise is not directly involved in this phase, but it may be called upon to analyze anomalies identified by the AI tools. When unsupervised learning algorithms detect deviations in the DT's behavior, it becomes crucial to assess the severity of these deviations. This assessment is the responsibility of the human operator, who, if necessary, triggers the maintenance phase. Here, the evaluation of DT parameters differs from the setup phase, as parameters have evolved, requiring updates to maintain accuracy. Despite this difference, the functionalities of this phase closely resemble those of the setup phase, with many of the same algorithms potentially being applicable. The primary goal remains to ensure the DT's ongoing precision and reliability as it continues to operate with the physical system. The true value of a Digital Twin perpetually hinges upon its application in real-world contexts. The pivotal question remains: can the information derived from the Digital Twin replace wasteful expenditure of physical resources, such as time, energy, and materials? The answer lies in the cost-effectiveness of collecting, processing, storing, and retrieving this information in comparison to the expense of squandering tangible resources. As the cost of virtual bits continues its exponential decline, physical atoms concurrently become scarcer, even at the rate of inflation, underscoring the necessity and urgency of this paradigm shift.    54  2.2 Digital Twins in the Energy sector and Distributed Energy Resources (DER) The energy sector is currently undergoing a significant transformation towards digitalization, driven by the need of decarbonization and sustainable development (Kueppers et al., 2021), (Tsoutsanis & Meskin, 2019), (Farhana et al., 2021), (Huang et al., 2022). For organizations in this sector to thrive in the digital age, it's crucial for their leaders to anticipate market changes and implement flexible procedures while seamlessly integrating cutting-edge technologies.  Digitalization plays a pivotal role in enhancing the security, efficiency, and sustainability of energy systems. By harnessing data collection and analysis technologies, digitization can significantly boost energy efficiency. These data are processed using technologies like artificial intelligence and then transmitted to devices capable of effecting physical changes to optimize energy utilization (Borowski, 2021). However, there is currently a limited body of research addressing the applications of digital twins within the energy industry. In this study, we aim to explore the main potential uses of digital twins in the energy sector exploring instances where digital twins are already being utilized in the energy industry in order to establish a framework of criteria for evaluating this technology.  Identifying the diverse applications and use cases of digital twin technology within the energy sector is key (Figure  10) and will be further discussed in terms of (1) applications of digital twins in energy production, encompassing various forms of energy generation, from fossil fuels to renewables such as photovoltaics and wind turbines, and even nuclear; (2) the utilization of digital twins in the domain of energy consumption, spanning buildings, transportation, and industrial applications; and (3) the deployment of digital twins in the energy storage industry, covering mechanical, thermal, battery, and hydrogen storage devices.  55   Figure  10. Energy and the Built World As modern cities continue to evolve, they give rise to intricate energy layers like transportation systems, smart grids, and microgrids, each confronting a multitude of challenges in multi-dimensional energy management. Within power grids, challenges encompass remote data transfer within the grid and various analyses reliant on real data. These complexities can be effectively addressed through the implementation and analysis of a comprehensive digital twin framework within each segment. Emerging smart technologies bring additional capabilities, including advanced computing and communication, which are challenging to represent in the physical layer alone. These enhanced capacities elevate the sophistication of power systems, necessitating novel approaches to tackle these challenges by providing enhanced insights into the physical infrastructure.  By establishing a robust DT power system, real-time and historical data can be effectively managed in a secure and efficient manner, contributing significantly to system operations by supporting maintenance, design, and operational management.  Despite being a relatively new and complex concept, the exploration of DT-based power systems is still in its preliminary stages. DTs hold promise for diverse applications within power systems, including fault detection, load prediction, operator behavior analysis, power system control and analysis, health condition assessment of power tools, and more. Given that real-time data on energy infrastructure is often not readily available, DT architectures can play a pivotal role in sustainable dispatching system operation and management. Consequently, DTs facilitate expedited decision-making through comprehensive and optimal management, bridging the gap in energy infrastructure. The concept of the smart city's DT is rooted in its ability to analyze the dynamics resulting from the intricate interdependencies between infrastructures,  56  including energy systems and various technologies. To realize the smart city's DT, it becomes imperative to deploy DTs across all energy systems within the smart city framework (Figure  11). Indeed, energy systems are intricately woven into the fabric of the smart city, playing a relevant role in its functioning and sustainability. The smart grid, a vital energy infrastructure, utilizes information and communication technology (cyber systems) to facilitate two-way communication for both energy and information transfer. This enhances grid monitoring, control, and consumer engagement. The physical components of the power grid include power generation facilities responsible for electricity generation, transmission facilities for power delivery, and power distribution facilities supplying electricity to consumers.   Figure  11. Electric grid assets and infrastructure The integration of cyber systems has given rise to the smart grid, the next-generation power grid designed to offer more efficient energy services. It encompasses reliable and intelligent distribution management, renewable energy integration, energy storage, grid monitoring, control, and the incorporation of electric vehicles.  The smart grid is essentially a highly distributed grid system, integrating information communication technologies like sensing, networking, data analytics, and machine learning. These technologies enhance grid reliability, efficiency, and security. The smart grid, being a large-scale distributed system, requires comprehensive knowledge of the physical objects' states, such as voltage and current. To achieve this, a multitude of sensors are deployed in the grid to measure critical object states, providing valuable insights. Static and dynamic state estimation methods, along with bad data detection algorithms, are employed to handle invalid or corrupted measurement data, which can result from measurement errors, sensor failures, or cyber threats. Notably, cyber threats can directly or  57  indirectly impact grid operations by injecting malicious measurement data or manipulating control information. Addressing cyber threats necessitates monitoring not only the physical objects but also the state of cyber components. Here, Digital Twins offer a promising solution by bridging the physical and cyber worlds and creating a linkage between them.  2.2.1 Data-driven modeling strategies DT employs a data-driven approach to map the physical grid onto the digital grid, facilitating comprehensive monitoring and management. In the DT architecture discussed earlier, the smart grid system is divided into distinct layers: the object layer, communication layer, application layer, and end-user layer. In the object layer, grid components encompass power generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. The communication layer connects these objects, facilitating data exchange with the application layer and intra-object layer communication. For instance, the communication layer's gateway stores device information from the object layer. When data is required by the application layer, the gateway retrieves it from specific devices as needed. Moreover, the application layer can construct a digital model based on device distribution information from the gateway. The application layer comprises a digital representation of gateways from the physical system, incorporating device information from the object layer. It acts as an intermediary between the application and object layers, with AI models trained using data collected from the object layer and stored in data storage for future utilization. If there are changes in the physical object layer, the application layer can send commands to actuators to adjust grid operations based on real-time data and trained models. Additionally, the AI model can update itself to reflect any changes in the object layer. The end-user layer leverages information processed by the application layer to offer various services, including smart grid management systems, autonomous vehicle smart charging systems, and hybrid energy management systems. Numerous research initiatives have explored DT's application in the smart grid (Tzanis et al., 2020c), (Saad et al., 2020a), (Danilczyk et al., 2021a). For example, General Electric (GE) introduced two DT models for wind farms. In the object layer, a communication network enables wind turbines to communicate, with middleware involving cloud-based infrastructure and digital models to collect data and remotely control turbines. A graphical user interface  58  (GUI) in the application layer provides visualization and control capabilities for wind farm management. (Saad et al., 2020b) proposed a microgrid DT model employing IoT to counter cyber-attacks. It includes microgrids, local controllers, and area controllers, featuring real-time balancing algorithms to mitigate the impact of attacks. Similarly, (Tzanis et al., 2020d) applied DT to manage a large number of smart grid devices. They used spike neural networks (SNN) in smart meters to detect fault nodes and a transient state estimator (TSE) to monitor the grid's dynamic state. (Danilczyk et al., 2021b) employed deep learning algorithms to detect physical faults in the smart grid system by analyzing data from the supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA). (Baboli et al., 2020) proposed a DT framework with artificial neural networks (ANN) for distributed smart grids, ensuring real-time model generation, verification, and identification.  2.2.2 Microgrid and complex systems A microgrid is a self-contained energy system comprised of distributed energy resources and interconnected loads. This versatile asset can operate in either island mode or grid-connected mode, offering flexibility and control (Liang et al., 2019). Microgrids are designed with the overarching goal of enhancing the overall performance of energy systems, focusing on sustainability, security, efficiency, economics, and effective energy management. Key attributes influencing microgrid performance include reliability, security, flexibility, self-sufficiency, and optimality. While extensive research has been dedicated to improving microgrid performance, the exploration of Digital Twins in the analysis, design, control, and development of microgrids is a relatively novel research area. This section delves into the application of DT services in microgrid contexts and highlights recent studies in this emerging field. The smart grid, functioning as an energy-based Cyber-Physical System (CPS), represents a complex system characterized by significant uncertainties affecting both its cyber and physical components (Dileep, 2020), (Z. Guan et al., 2015), (H. Xu et al., 2020). These uncertainties can originate from various sources, including grid outages. In essence, the smart grid remains susceptible and vulnerable to random events such as power load imbalances, outages, and even external disruptions from its surroundings. It is paramount to acknowledge the critical significance and inherent fragility of the smart grid, given the unprecedented challenges it confronts.  59  The evolution of big data and the Internet of Things (IoT) opens up opportunities to address these challenges. The utilization of advanced big data analysis tools such as Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), data mining, and statistics holds the potential to predict and anticipate potential risks within the smart grid (Ponnusamy et al., 2021). This predictive capability enables the implementation of proactive measures to mitigate accidents and disruptions effectively. Moreover, harnessing the power of big data enables the creation of a virtual smart grid environment. This virtual simulation environment can replicate real-world accidents and disturbances, allowing for comprehensive investigation and the development of robust mitigation strategies. In essence, the synergy between big data analytics and the smart grid offers a path towards enhancing resilience and reliability in the face of dynamic and uncertain challenges. DTs play a pivotal role in microgrid environments, offering diverse capabilities for scheduling, optimization, and planning, especially in scenarios where conducting real-time experiments is impractical. Microgrids encompass renewable energy resources, demand components, and communication network segments, each of which can benefit from dedicated DTs. To establish a microgrid DT, individual DTs are constructed for each segment. Subsequently, an aggregate DT is formed, comprising DTs from all three segments. This holistic approach enables comprehensive monitoring and control of the entire microgrid. Notably, DTs are increasingly finding applications across a wide spectrum of industries, including discrete manufacturing, process manufacturing, energy (power), oil and gas, mining and metals, automotive, life sciences and medical, aerospace, infrastructure, and defense. In the energy sector, DTs offer solutions to various challenges, including: Predicting energy demand for individual consumers using machine learning (ML) approaches within planning and operational DTs. \uf0a7 Improving grid management and distribution by leveraging real-time data-driven simulation models for distributed energy sources. \uf0a7 Enhancing maintenance of solar arrays by identifying abnormal behavior for timely repairs. \uf0a7 Anticipating maintenance needs for wind farms to support service teams effectively. The integration of DTs into microgrid applications and broader energy systems underscores their potential to drive innovation, efficiency, and resilience in the evolving energy landscape.  60  The concept of Digital Twins (DT) offers practical and efficient possibilities in real-time data presentation and forecast analysis. Instead of relying solely on historical data, utilizing microgrid digital data outputs can lead to more accurate predictions for energy management and future system responses. Accurate load growth prediction is crucial for optimizing and making microgrid development programs more efficient, particularly as the development of microgrids depends on future load expansion. The integration of DT can significantly impact long-term microgrid development planning. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have demonstrated their prowess in solving prediction and diagnosis problems. Load forecasting, which depends on factors that influence load consumption patterns, includes Short-term forecasting (STLF), Mid-term forecasting (MTLF), and Long-term forecasting (LTLF). Deep Learning (DL) methods have been applied in microgrids for load forecasting, enhancing prediction accuracy. Network studies encompass a wide array of analyses, including restoration, reliability, prediction, energy hub, uncertainty, and physical and cyber security. Implementing DT-based power grids can enhance network behavior under various conditions, reducing response times from minutes to seconds. Recent studies on power grids utilizing DT techniques are summarized in Table 3. DT's predictive capabilities are invaluable in planning maintenance processes, enabling simulations for optimal solutions and protection strategies, ultimately streamlining system maintenance. DT technology facilitates remote distance control and monitoring, enhancing reliability and reducing costs. Distance protection relays and fault location algorithms have been tested using DT, and DT-based distributed networks have been used for troubleshooting in transformer performance evaluation. Energy hubs, which convert different types of energy in urban systems, require efficient energy consumption management. DT's real-time data control, monitoring, and analysis capabilities make it a promising tool for improving the performance of energy hub systems. Integrating DTs from energy carriers such as water, electricity, and gas into the energy hub's DT aggregation can address energy management challenges effectively. Successful implementation of DT relies on robust IT infrastructure, as it requires interconnected and powerful systems. While cloud services like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google offer significant benefits, they also present security challenges in data analysis. Edge computing can mitigate data transmission delays, increase bandwidth, and play a pivotal role in preprocessing, storage, and analysis for DT applications.   61  2.2.3 Energy supply, consumption and storage Uncertainty is a significant factor in power systems due to unpredictable elements and their random behaviours. Addressing uncertainty is crucial for solving power system problems and achieving effective system control. Real-time monitoring and analysis are essential to manage the uncertain behaviour of random factors in any system. In power systems, the integration of random entities such as wind turbines and solar photovoltaics, coupled with the unpredictability of consumer consumption, contributes to the inherent uncertainty in power networks and energy systems. Numerous techniques have been proposed to model the random behaviour of uncertainty parameters (D. Silva et al., 2021b). However, accurate modelling and real-time analysis are essential to understand and control the system effectively. Digital Twins (DT) technology offers valuable support for understanding and managing the random behaviour of physical entities through real-time monitoring, control, and online analysis. With DT technology, the real-time physical behaviour of an agent can be observed continuously, effectively reducing uncertainty. It enables the thorough investigation of real-time physical entities, providing high fidelity and accuracy, which is a desired feature in DT technology to support the uncertainty of physical systems. The concept of an energy hub involves the simultaneous communication and exchange of energy carriers within a network (K. Yang et al., 2021). Energy hubs serve as converters for various types of energy in different urban system components. These hubs extend beyond the electricity sector, encompassing gas and urban water, and play a pivotal role in managing energy consumption across multiple sectors (Cagnano et al., 2020b). Integrating and efficiently managing energy consumption within these hubs requires systems and approaches that analyze behavioral changes and monitor energy consumption. Real-time access to accurate data is critical for this purpose. Digital Twins, with their capabilities in real-time data control, monitoring, and analysis, promise enhanced performance for energy hub systems. Integrating initial DTs from energy carriers such as water, electricity, and gas into the DT aggregation of energy hubs can effectively address the challenges of energy management, integration, and exchange.   62   Figure  12. An example of DT concept's Energy Hub Figure  12 provides an illustrative example of a DT concept applied to an energy hub, highlighting its potential in enhancing the performance and efficiency of energy systems in urban environments.  2.2.4 Load prediction and forecasting  Real-time data availability is a fundamental requirement for various forecast analyses in areas such as load forecasting and system response prediction. The accuracy of forecast outputs is directly linked to the accuracy and real-time nature of the input physical data. Extensive literature has established a direct correlation between prediction accuracy and the use of Digital Twins (DT) services (D. Wu et al., 2019b). The specificity of DT in presenting real-time data makes it a practical and efficient tool for forecast analysis. Instead of relying solely on historical data, microgrid digital data outputs can be utilized to achieve more precise predictions for energy management and future system responses. Accurate load growth predictions are particularly vital for optimizing microgrid development programs, as the expansion and growth of load in the future are key factors in microgrid planning and efficiency. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have demonstrated their robust predictive and diagnostic capabilities. Load forecasting, which depends on various factors that can influence consumption patterns, includes Short-term forecasting (STLF), Mid-term forecasting (MTLF), and Long-term forecasting (LTLF). Deep Learning (DL) methods have been extensively applied in microgrid load forecasting, improving prediction accuracy.  63  For example, in STLF, Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been employed (Din & Marnerides, 2017) Feed-forward DNN and Recurrent-DNN models have been compared Fare clic o toccare qui per immettere il testo.(He et al., 2017), and Deep Belief Networks (DBN) combined with parametric Copula models have been suggested for hourly load forecasting (Dedinec et al., 2016). Additionally, DBN composed of multiple layers of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) has been used for STLF, fine-tuning parameters through supervised back-propagation training (Wen et al., 2020). DRNN-GRU models have been presented for STLF and MTLF using consumption data (Estebsari & Rajabi, 2020) and CNN has been used for residential load forecasting Fare clic o toccare qui per immettere il testo.(Tong et al., 2018). Stacked Denoising Auto-Encoders (SDAs) have been proposed for electricity load forecasting, with the output data from SDAs used as input for Support Vector Regression (SVR) models (Marino et al., 2016). LSTM methods have been introduced for load demand prediction at hourly and minute ahead levels (Khodayar et al., 2019), and DBN has been used for wind and PV power prediction (W. Wu et al., 2016). A DNN method, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), has been proposed for deterministic short-term wind power forecasting (Francisco et al., 2020). Integrating these high-capability ML algorithms into a digital environment based on DT enhances the efficiency and accuracy of real-time forecasting and analysis. Adapting prediction models with real-time data ensures the development of accurate prediction models, enabling effective planning and operation of power systems.   2.2.5 Plan and monitoring Effective energy management within a microgrid necessitates the presence of control systems in each system component. These control systems facilitate the collection and access of data to the central decision-making system, enabling optimal energy management. The installation of measurement systems at various points in the network is essential for data quantification. Control systems and energy management systems rely on measurement data for informed decision-making. However, challenges arise in achieving optimal decisions due to errors in data estimation from measurement devices. In (R. S. Srinivasan et al., 2020), a framework for energy management based on Digital Twins (DTs) is proposed, where smart meters are employed to collect entity data. This approach leverages DT technology to enable real-time monitoring of renewable energy resources, addressing real-time operational and monitoring challenges (Sivalingam et al., 2018). Similarly, (Ebrahimi, 2019) suggests a DT-based platform for energy demand management.  64  The utilization of DTs extends to optimizing the management of wind farms, as demonstrated in (Lamagna et al., 2021), where a DT for wind farms is employed for performance evaluation and health management. Additionally, (Steindl & Kastner, 2021) applies DT technology to display, process, and evaluate the performance of energy storage systems within a virtual environment. This technology plays a pivotal role in determining scheduling programs for the operation process. Ontologies and semantic web methods are also introduced as common techniques for DT modeling (Glatt et al., 2021)]. These methods enable the creation of layered structures for specific smart grid architectures and various energy systems. Ontologies can be used to model customer load profiles, power generation systems, and substructures of generation through organized constructions. Semantic web technologies offer a level of abstraction for energy system simulation and modeling, adaptable to different energy systems (Y. Xu et al., 2019). Edge-based DTs have emerged to create virtual simulation environments for performance assessment, enhancing the resilience of microgrids (H.-A. Park et al., 2020). These approaches collectively enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of energy management within microgrids, addressing the challenges posed by real-time data processing and decision-making.  2.2.6 Real-time analysis and optimization To establish a Digital Twin (DT)-driven model, it's essential to consider three key components: physical space, virtual space, and the data interaction between these spaces. This comprehensive model requires the identification of nodes within a specific system, which are then meticulously modelled. The integrated model incorporates various data sources, including historical data and sensor data, to create an accurate representation of the system under diverse states (H. Yang et al., 2019). Evaluating the states of the DT model over a specified time period allows for the resolution and analysis of the model. This perspective provides a comprehensive understanding of the system's state, facilitating analysis and decision-making. As most models exhibit continuous changes over time, dynamic simulation of the model is imperative. Designing a DT involves various phases, including modeling physical systems, connecting real-time data, and evaluating and adapting the model. A virtual model can be constructed using historical data from different system states, integrated with information based on system dynamics. In this context, three main approaches are employed: physics-based modeling, data-driven modeling, and a combination of both. Physics-based models are constructed using mathematical and physical models, with machine  65  learning techniques such as AI used for parameter estimation when there is insufficient information (Ahmadian et al., 2018), (Danilczyk et al., 2021c). For instance, (Khaled N., 2020) employs an artificial neural network (ANN) to adjust inverter model parameters. Data-driven models are utilized when it's challenging to formulate mathematical representations of system elements. These models can incorporate extensive historical data, making them suitable for scenarios where a physics-based model may be inadequate. Data-driven models are continuously improved with real-time data to enhance accuracy and alignment with the actual system. It is essential to note that secure and accurate data transmission is a fundamental capability of the DT. Managing large volumes of data from multiple sources is a challenging task, necessitating advanced data analysis approaches for preprocessing. Data is shared through secure and reliable communication systems, selected based on specific requirements, including quantitative and qualitative aspects. Communication options encompass wired, wireless, and hybrid systems. Preprocessing and standardizing the raw data are crucial steps to prepare it for specific purposes such as management and control. Big data analytics, often implemented in cloud-based environments, is instrumental in processing large datasets to extract meaningful insights. Cloud computing's significant storage and computational capabilities facilitate various applications, including data mining, dimension reduction, filtering, and processing. Big data analysis plays a pivotal role in DT modeling, particularly in the smart grid and smart city domains (Song, Cai, et al., 2020), (Song, Jiang, et al., 2020). Additionally, it helps integrate continuous and discrete information flows within microgrids. Fog and edge computing can also be deployed to reduce data transfer latency and integrate various services. A case study of artificial intelligence approaches to edge computing is discussed in (Reka & Dragicevic, 2018). Maintaining the consistency and accuracy of a DT model is a significant challenge, given the continuous shifts in operating states and environmental conditions of physical systems over time. Continuous model updates are necessary, as real-time data is collected through control and monitoring applications and processed using data analysis techniques throughout the system's lifecycle. Evaluating and adapting the model is a critical step in establishing a DT. Parameters can be adjusted, physical configurations optimized, and various stimulus procedures tracked for model adaptation. Changes in observed data over a specific time period can be used to update the model. Advanced machine learning algorithms, including deep learning and reinforcement learning, are effective strategies for these purposes. A survey of machine learning techniques is discussed in (Y. Zhang et al., 2018)  66  In practice, a real-time DT model can be developed using tools such as Simulink, Simscape, MATLAB, and Raspberry Pi hardware (Carvalho et al., 2020). The desired model is deployed on Raspberry Pi hardware, which acts as a real-world representation of the entity being modelled. Raspberry Pi hardware communicates the system's state and input/output data to cloud services like Amazon AWS, enabling the creation of a parallel DT model in the cloud. This cloud-based DT model, utilizing the same inputs as the physical model, conducts real-time, accurate, and efficient system diagnosis (Carvalho et al., 2020). The hardware's Wi-Fi capability facilitates seamless communication with the cloud to share the physical states of entities implemented in the hardware environment. This synchronized approach ensures that the DT model remains consistent and up-to-date with the physical system it represents.   2.2.7 Diagnostic systems and fault detection Faults in the microgrid environment are inevitable and can pose significant challenges to the grid's operators and control systems. These faults, if left undetected or unaddressed, can lead to widespread issues within the entire system. Therefore, the timely detection of faults is crucial to prevent irreparable damage. A fault detection system must possess the capability to detect faults promptly, determine their time and location, and initiate fault interruption procedures promptly. To achieve this, access to real-time data is essential. Real-time analysis plays a relevant role in addressing these challenges by enabling the detection of faults as they occur. Implementing a Digital Twin (DT) of the microgrid allows for real-time analysis of the entire network, contributing to the stability, reliability, and flexibility of the microgrid. In (Jain et al., 2020), researchers investigate the development of DTs to facilitate fault detection. A fault detection system for distributed energy resources, based on the DT concept, is developed in (Tzanis et al., 2020e). (Palensky et al., 2022) proposes a monitoring system that relies on DT technology to predict faults in a physical power converter, integrating it with a digital model controlled by a controller. Additionally, (Joseph et al., 2018) presents a digital model of a power system to track dynamic voltage faults and forecast post-fault dynamic behavior. The concept of DT is harnessed in (Bazmohammadi et al., 2022b) for controller design and distributed energy resources. In (Goia et al., 2022), DT technology is developed and deployed to evaluate the operation of microgrid controllers. These initiatives leverage DTs to enhance fault detection and overall grid performance, ensuring the microgrid's reliability and stability.   67  2.3  Digital Twins and Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Enhancing the comprehension of indoor air quality (IAQ) and the factors that influence it can lead to improved management of indoor environmental quality (IEQ), resulting in decreased health hazards and enhanced well-being for occupants. The domains of energy, health, and economy are closely interconnected with the IAQ concept, particularly concerning aspects such as air ventilation, public health, and productivity. Based on extensive reports from scientific sources, the proportion of time during which individuals are exposed to indoor environments (such as residential buildings, workplaces, vehicles, public transportation, and public facilities like schools, hospitals, museums, theatres, and libraries) exceeds 80% in developed nations, over 87% in the United States, and around 85-90% in Europe. These estimates could be even higher due to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting changes in lifestyle, such as lockdowns and remote work. Consequently, it is of utmost importance to thoroughly consider the implications of indoor air quality (IAQ) on human health and overall well-being. The study and characterization of IAQ, coupled with the growing attention and practical initiatives to establish healthy and comfortable indoor environments, have the potential to significantly enhance the quality of life and productivity for occupants. Notably, exposure to indoor air pollution can surpass outdoor air pollution exposure by more than twofold. Shockingly, it's estimated that a global population of approximately 3 billion individuals experiences inadequate IAQ levels on a daily basis. Addressing IAQ concerns is crucial for promoting public health and well-being Exposure to poor indoor air quality (IAQ) can lead to a range of health issues, including irritation, allergic symptoms, impaired cognitive abilities, reduced productivity, dizziness, headaches, restlessness, asphyxia, coma, cancer, and even death. Various scientific studies have linked inadequate IAQ to these adverse health outcomes (World Health Organization. Regional Office for Europe, 2010).  2.3.1 IAQ and External Ventilation Flow Rate evaluation Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) refers to the quality of the air within buildings and structures, specifically how it affects the health and comfort of the occupants. External air flow rate, often referred to as ventilation, is a critical factor that directly influences IAQ.  In summary, the connection between IAQ and external air flow rate is crucial. Proper ventilation and fresh air intake directly impact the quality of the air indoors by diluting pollutants, controlling CO2 levels, preventing moisture- 68  related issues, removing odors, and enhancing overall comfort. To maintain a healthy indoor environment, it's essential to design and operate ventilation systems that provide an appropriate external air flow rate based on the specific requirements of the space and its occupants. The absence of explicit and detailed legal directives pertaining to Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) can largely be attributed to the inherent variability, diversity, and challenges associated with gathering consistent analytical data for all the factors and sources involved. IAQ is a complex concept that encompasses a wide range of factors rather than being confined to a single measurement element. Furthermore, there are numerous architectural and design variables that are interconnected with IAQ. Complicating matters further, the conflicting energy efficiency goals across various parameters, as discussed earlier, contribute to the intricate, intertwined, and adaptable nature of IAQ on both spatial and temporal scales. To address this complexity, the development of IAQ indexes becomes crucial. These indexes serve to explain, categorize, and enhance the quality of indoor air by providing user-friendly and comprehensive scores (rankings) of IAQ levels within indoor environments. Despite the global development of various IAQ indexes in recent years, their specific relevance to assessing IAQ levels hasn't been fully explored. Aiming for a comprehensive and expedient assessment of IAQ through an index can streamline the creation of effective measurement, qualification, and maintenance protocols for control purposes. However, choosing an appropriate evaluation measure for this purpose presents a significant challenge due to the indexes present in the scientific literature. Moreover, the distinction between health risk-based and comfort-based indexes remains unclear.  2.3.2 IAQ measurement and protocols The primary objective of this review is to comprehensively identify and categorize the existing IAQ indexes on a global scale (World Health Organization. Regional Office for Europe, 2010) as a specific regard to buildings energy efficiency strategies. Contemporary comprehensive methodologies and standards, exemplified by Standard NBN EN 16798\u20131:2019, are being progressively implemented to integrate building energy efficiency with indoor environmental conditions (Olesen B. W., 2012). The growing trend of constructing tightly sealed dwellings has incentivized architects and building companies to enhance the performance of ventilation systems and bolster overall energy efficiency. However, the tension between achieving \"energy efficiency improvements\" and adhering to \"IAQ  69  guidelines\" necessitates the creation, advancement, and optimization of multifaceted strategies for indoor air purification. The pursuit of increased air exchange rates (AERs) to enhance indoor air quality leads to higher energy consumption by ventilation systems, thereby potentially diminishing building energy efficiency. This presents a challenge that requires innovative solutions for providing adequate ventilation while minimizing energy consumption. Several factors come into play, including IAQ standards, the type of ventilation systems, and occupants' activities. This duality of interest arises between policies aiming for high IAQ and those emphasizing reduced building energy use. The design of modern indoor environments must address these conflicting demands to effectively tackle emerging challenges and requirements (\u0160ujanov\u00e1 et al., 2019) Notably, the European Union's policy-making body, through the revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD, 2018/844), has mandated that energy performance criteria set by EU member states' executive administrations should optimize health, indoor air quality, and comfort measures. To facilitate the transition towards an energy-efficient and decarbonized building stock by 2050, EU governments must adopt a comprehensive approach encompassing these pivotal factors (Buildings Performance Institute Europe (BPIE), 2019): incorporating indoor environmental quality (IEQ) measures into long-term renovation strategies; integrating IEQ considerations with Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs); formulating strategies that are cost-optimal and evaluating the various factors influencing IEQ; ensuring certification, agreement, and quality control measures to actively support the provision of acceptable IEQ. Numerous indoor environments rely on mechanical ventilation systems that introduce a limited amount of outdoor air, which can lead to the accumulation of indoor pollutants. According to the ASHRAE standard (ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2022, 2022), three distinct approaches\u2014namely, Ventilation Rate, IAQ, and/or Natural Ventilation are employed to meet ventilation criteria. In the ventilation rate procedure with prescriptive method, ventilation rates are predetermined based on building usage, the number of occupants, and floor area. On the contrary the IAQ procedure in a performance-based approach defines outdoor air intake rates and other parameters considering pollution sources, Exposure Limit Values (ELVs), and the perceived acceptability of indoor air quality. A procedure involving natural ventilation is based on the inflow of outdoor air through openings into indoor spaces and can be used in conjunction with mechanical ventilation systems. However, contemporary energy-efficient designs, characterized by reduced air leakage and tightly sealed constructions, can substantially curtail natural ventilation. This shift towards high-sealed indoor environments can lead to the accumulation of indoor pollutants due to inadequate air exchange rates (Godish & Spengler, 1996)  70  It's important to note that the recommended minimum levels for indoor air quality indicators may not always correspond to optimal levels. For example, the (EN 16798-1:2018, 2018) standard specifies an absolute minimum ventilation value of 4 liters per second per person, while scientific research often proposes values of 6 to 7 liters per second per person or even higher when additional parameters such as productivity and learning are taken into account. As policymakers increasingly prioritize concepts like \"energy transition,\" \"carbon neutrality,\" and \"net-zero emissions,\" regulations and policies addressing outdoor air pollution are being developed and implemented more rapidly than those focused on indoor environments. Additionally, changes in inhabitants' behaviours and lifestyles due to climate change can also influence indoor pollutant concentrations (Vardoulakis et al., 2015). Consequently, there is a growing recognition of the need to address the impact of indoor pollution sources on indoor air quality (IAQ). While controlling the emission sources to reduce indoor contaminants is a viable approach when sources are well-known, it's important to note that new substances are continuously being identified as harmful to health. Therefore, the prevention or reduction of indoor contaminant emissions often has limitations, may be technically challenging, and might not always be cost-effective (Kwok et al., 2022). In this context, the role of ventilation emerges as critical in effectively controlling and maintaining good IAQ. Ventilation plays a pivotal role in ensuring that indoor air remains free from pollutants and meets acceptable quality standards. The current standards and guidelines for Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) aim to establish recommended concentration levels, values for indoor climate parameters, and appropriate air ventilation requirements. These guidelines serve as the scientific foundation for legally enforceable standards. The recommended levels of pollutant concentrations are described using various terms, such as, Exposure Limit Values (ELV)6, Threshold Limit Value (TLV)7, Lowest  6 Exposure Limit Values (ELV): These are the levels of pollutants considered acceptable over a specified period of time. ELVs also serve as benchmarks to assess whether IAQ is improving or deteriorating. 7 Threshold Limit Value (TLV) the maximum average airborne concentration of a hazardous material to which healthy adult workers can be exposed during an 8-hour workday and 40-hour workweek.  71  Concentration of Interest (LCI)8, Toxicity Reference Value (TRV)9, and Occupational Exposure Limit (OEL)10.  The definitions below provide a clear understanding of the terminology used to describe pollutant concentrations and their associated regulatory measures in the context of IAQ standards and guidelines (UK Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs, 2010). The primary goal of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive overview of various IAQ indexes with different applications. This compilation and classification aim to be a valuable resource for professionals working in diverse fields, including Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS), HVAC design, architecture, indoor air monitoring device manufacturing, indoor air purifier production, healthcare, and various scientific and engineering disciplines. The literature presents several perspectives for classifying IAQ indexes. Although researchers agree that IAQ indexes can be categorized based on both subjective and objective principles, they can be further classified based on their intended application.  A classification is focused on specific application: IAQ indexes can be categorized based on their intended application. This includes health-related indexes that focus on pollutants and factors affecting human health, comfort-related indexes that assess indoor conditions for occupant comfort, and energy-related indexes that consider the energy efficiency aspects of ventilation and air exchange. The main classification is Subjective vs. Objective. Subjective evaluation of indoor air quality involves assessing occupants' perceptions and experiences related to the quality of the air they breathe. This assessment is often gathered through surveys, questionnaires, and feedback from building occupants. The focus is on how individuals feel about the indoor environment, whether they are satisfied or dissatisfied, and whether they find the air comfortable to breathe. Subjective evaluation takes into consideration factors such as odours, stuffiness, humidity, and overall comfort. This approach provides valuable insights into occupants' experiences but may not provide quantitative data about pollutant concentrations.  8 Lowest Concentration of Interest (LCI): The maximum acceptable pollutant levels that limit emissions from construction products before they are used by end-users. This is meant to control emissions from building materials and products. 9 Toxicity Reference Value (TRV): A toxicological indicator used to assess or quantify the risk to human health posed by exposure to pollutants.  10 Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs): Directing values for chemical substances present in workplace air. These values are designed to ensure the health and safety of workers with regard to their exposure.   72  Objective evaluation of indoor air quality is centred around quantifiable measurements of pollutants and parameters that directly influence air quality. This approach involves using scientific instruments and measurements to directly assess the concentration levels of various pollutants present in the indoor environment. These pollutants may include volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter (PM), carbon dioxide (CO2), formaldehyde, and more. The objective evaluation also involves comparing pollutant concentrations to established Exposure Limit Values (ELVs) or guidelines to determine if the indoor environment meets recommended safety standards. This approach provides concrete and measurable data about the actual state of indoor air quality. In summary, subjective evaluation focuses on occupants' feelings and experiences, while objective evaluation involves concrete measurements of pollutants and adherence to health-related standards. Both approaches contribute to a comprehensive understanding of indoor air quality and guide efforts to improve the indoor environment for the well-being and comfort of occupants. The IAQ indices highlighted in this analysis are those primarily reliant on measurements of concentrations of three parameters (airborne pollutants). The following two tables present, in chronological order, the literature referenced IAQ indexes related to residential and tertiary environments and industrial buildings, respectively.  Table 4.

This type of ventilation is distinct from natural ventilation, which relies on natural air movement driven by wind and temperature differences. In mechanical controlled ventilation, the introduction of fresh outdoor air and the removal of indoor air pollutants are regulated by mechanical systems. These systems are designed to ensure that a sufficient amount of outdoor air is brought into the building while simultaneously expelling indoor pollutants, excess humidity, and odours. Mechanical ventilation can be essential for maintaining good indoor air quality (IAQ) in spaces that are well-sealed, heavily insulated, or located in areas with adverse outdoor air conditions. Mechanical controlled ventilation systems can be designed with various levels of complexity, incorporating features like variable airflow rates, humidity control, and pollutant filtration. The goal of mechanical ventilation is to create a healthier and more comfortable indoor environment by ensuring a steady supply of fresh air and effective removal of indoor pollutants. There are various models of ventilation (Figure  13), including: \uf0a7 Supply Ventilation: fresh outdoor air is supplied to the indoor spaces through mechanical systems. This method helps ensure a constant supply of fresh air, but it may not effectively expel indoor pollutants. \uf0a7 Exhaust Ventilation: indoor air is expelled from the building using mechanical systems, creating negative pressure that draws in outdoor  76  air through natural leakage points or intentionally provided intake vents. \uf0a7 Balanced Ventilation: this approach combines both supply and exhaust systems to maintain a balance between indoor and outdoor air. it seeks to provide controlled and consistent ventilation without creating significant pressure imbalances. \uf0a7 Heat Recovery Ventilation (HRV) and Energy Recovery Ventilation (ERV): these systems capture the heat or energy from the exhausted indoor air and transfer it to the incoming outdoor air. This helps improve energy efficiency while maintaining ventilation.   Figure  13. Types of ventilation The two foremost priorities for the future of the construction industry are undoubtedly ensuring the healthiness and comfort of indoor spaces while simultaneously contributing to sustainability. It is for this reason that the combination of ventilation and energy efficiency emerges as the central emphasis with which new constructions should be designed, as well as the renovation of pre-existing structures. Ventilation refers to the process by which indoor air is renewed within a building. Traditionally, ventilation was manual and achieved by opening doors or windows to allow outdoor air to enter. While this approach might be effective, it contradicts the goal of energy efficiency, as experience has shown that the periods of open windows can be lengthy, resulting in significant energy consumption. As energy conservation is no longer an option but a mandate embedded in European regulations concerning energy efficiency in the construction sector, the EU's objective is to achieve complete decarbonization of the building stock by 2050.  77  It is precisely in the need to ensure sustainability and health that controlled mechanical ventilation becomes crucial in buildings. This entails the installation of systems that regulate the inflow of external air without causing substantial thermal imbalances and without impacting energy consumption. In essence, energy efficiency is maintained without compromising air quality and thermal comfort. There are two ways to implement a mechanical ventilation system: dingle-flow where the fan is used to expel stale air, while fresh outdoor air enters naturally through grilles; dual-flow system which involves two fans, one for extracting stale air and another for introducing clean air. The dual-flow system allows for precise control of air flow and is therefore the most efficient in terms of energy efficiency. The reference parameter within which the architectural project operates is that of green buildings or passive constructions, so in this new ecological model of sustainable buildings, where airtightness is a priority, natural ventilation is no longer a viable option.  The difficulty in controlling airflows in this type of solution, with the risk of high energy consumption and poor air quality, has led to the recognition that natural ventilation is no longer sufficient or suitable. Conversely, controlled mechanical ventilation systems provide a triple guarantee: proper air exchange, maintenance of thermal comfort, and energy efficiency. Without a doubt, the dual-flow system is the most comprehensive option, as it offers a significant enhancement: the possibility of incorporating a heat recovery unit, both in domestic environments and industrial buildings, as well as the filtration of outdoor air and improved sound insulation for the building. DCV management strategies are commonly founded on occupancy-related control markers. Nevertheless, approaches encompassing the regulation of pollutants not contingent upon occupancy are demanded and more viable with the emergence of economical sensors (ES). In the following, some techniques for the enhancement of demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) through the utilization of measurements of IAQ parameters using some correlation assessments are introduced. The objective is the study of the effectiveness of DCV in curtailment of yearly energy consumption and the proportion of instances when indoor air quality (IAQ) parameter concentrations exceeded specified limits (Justo Alonso et al., 2023). The pursuit of reducing uncontrolled air leakage has highlighted the necessity for ventilation systems employing demand control to efficiently ensure satisfactory indoor air quality (IAQ) (Mysen et al., 2005). Notably, in countries like China, Canada, and the USA, the recirculation of return air is a cutting-edge practice. Here, the minimum outdoor air (OA) fraction is influenced by  78  both IAQ standards requirements and the aim to decrease heating, cooling, and dehumidification loads on air handling unit (AHU) coils. However, insufficient OA fractions in conjunction with tightly sealed buildings could potentially compromise IAQ (Nazaroff, 2013). Airborne pollutants that would otherwise be ventilated might be recirculated within the space (Figure  14), and environmental parameters such as temperature and humidity could escalate to undesirable levels. Simulations have indicated that well-regulated recirculation of a portion of return air can provide protection against outdoor pollutants and lead to reduced annual energy consumption (Justo Alonso, Dols, et al., 2022). This is primarily due to the relationship between indoor and outdoor pollutant concentrations, which is contingent on OA supply and filter efficiency (Ekberg, 1994).   Figure  14. Source of indoor air pollutans IAQ criteria in most countries are rooted in health impacts and perceptions of IAQ quality, (Scutaru & Witterseh, 2020). However, some pollutants like nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, ozone, particulate matter, and formaldehyde, are infrequently measured due to the expense of traditional measurement equipment. As a result, up until recently (Ma et al., 2021), the literature has predominantly referred to IAQ measurements as CO2 levels, temperature, and occasionally relative humidity (RH). Manufacturers have endeavoured to bridge this gap by enabling the measurement of health-related pollutants alongside  79  standard measurements through the integration of low-cost sensors (ES), defined in this context as sensors costing less than \u20ac 50,00. While these sensors provide cost-effective measurement options, their accuracy often falls below that of reference equipment. Standardized communication between ES and conventional ventilation control systems is not yet established. While this may currently contribute to more complex systems, future enhancements are anticipated (Chiesa et al., 2019). Additionally, ES could contribute to reducing embodied CO2 emissions, as many of these sensors can communicate wirelessly, facilitating emission reduction. CO2 serves as a reliable indicator for bio effluents (Morawska et al., 2021), making it commonly used alongside temperature to regulate ventilation through demand control (DCV). However, over 50% of pollutants in office settings are not emitted by occupants, and in residential spaces, NO2, CO, PM10, and PM2.5 may hold significant relevance. Furthermore, CO2 does not necessarily correlate with other prevalent IAQ pollutants (Gonzalo et al., 2022), leading to potential misrepresentation if used as a proxy. Ratios of indoor to outdoor pollutant concentrations (I/O ratios) are influenced by factors like the season, building tightness, installed filters, and the specific pollutants being considered (Majd et al., 2019). Several studies have concurrently measured elevated levels of \"other\" pollutants alongside low CO2 concentrations during occupancy (Choe et al., 2022). As a result, some researchers advocate using CO2 to indicate occupant-related pollutants (Maddalena et al., 2015) while others recommend monitoring additional parameters (Society\u2019s Indoor Carbon Dioxide Position Document Committee, 2022). This is particularly important since CO2 and temperature might not adequately detect airborne pollutants with more significant health, comfort, and productivity implications. Thus, establishing a selection protocol for essential airborne pollutants becomes imperative due to limited knowledge regarding ventilation control based on multiple IAQ parameters. While demand control ventilation (DCV) and economizers have found common applications in office settings, literature concerning the utilization of economizers and heat recovery systems was notably absent. Similarly, limited research focused on the optimization of DCV or the recirculation of return air, considering broader perspectives encompassing energy consumption and IAQ beyond the scope of CO2 and temperature. HVAC control sequences specified in ASHRAE Guideline 36, primarily centered around occupancy, CO2, and temperature. The utilization of these sequences resulted in energy savings of 31% (K. Zhang et al., 2022). However, these sequences are deterministic and overlook the impact of modulating outdoor air (OA) on airborne pollutants beyond the preselected parameters. Other studies have tackled different facets of control. For example, research has assessed real-world performance (Afroz et  80  al., 2020a), forecasted pollutants (Kallio et al., 2021), optimized ventilation control and evaluated simulation strategies (W. Wang et al., 2020). A recent position paper by ASHRAE (Society\u2019s Indoor Carbon Dioxide Position Document Committee, 2022) urged the exploration of \"Strategies for DCV using CO2 and other indicators of occupancy that overcome limitations of current approaches and control contaminants that are not linked to occupancy.\" Nevertheless, the paper did not provide guidance on the selection and utilization of these additional non-occupancy-related indicators in DCV sequences. To determine which measurable contaminants not tied to occupancy are essential for controlling ventilation, correlation analysis can be employed. Correlation analyses are pragmatic, as utilizing one of the correlated parameters in the control logic would be sufficient to represent the entire set of correlated parameters and regulate the supplied airflow rate (Justo Alonso, Wolf, et al., 2022). In the literature, Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients are commonly adopted for correlation analyses [H.W. Davies et al]. However, these analyses focus on concurrent correlations and do not delve into the cause-and-effect relationship between variables over time. Cross-correlation functions (CCFs) offer a solution to this limitation [M. Justo et al], revealing correlations even when they exhibit temporal shifts. CCFs calculate Pearson correlations across simultaneous and time-shifted lags. The incorporation of new or additional parameters into ventilation control strategies can be intricate and challenging. Due to their distinct origins, these parameters exhibit diverse emission profiles and strengths, which might yield conflicting control feedback. Validated simulations can streamline the trial-and-error process for ventilation controls. Numerous simulation programs are available for assessing DCV strategies, such as EnergyPlus, TRNSYS, CONTAM, and Modelica. However, most of these programs cannot concurrently simulate all aspects encompassing energy usage, airflow, IAQ, pollutant sources, and HVAC controls. Consequently, the existing simulation literature has largely focused on energy or IAQ in isolation, but none have comprehensively explored the simultaneous effects of extended IAQ (including CO2, temperature, and several other airborne pollutants) and energy usage when utilizing DCV and recirculating return air. This weakness can be addressed through co-simulation. Co-simulation between EnergyPlus and CONTAM or CONTAM and TRNSYS can be employed when evaluating all the parameters mentioned above. Such co-simulation enables the evaluation of overall energy consumption, airflow, and IAQ in a building, and both tools are freely accessible. The research gap that this review addresses is the objective of refining ventilation control logic to curtail annual energy consumption and minimize the instances in which CO2, temperature, several other airborne pollutants, and RH exceed the thresholds defined in existing literature.  This work serves as a pivotal  81  step towards redefining ventilation control paradigms and accommodates the anticipated integration of various pollutant measurements facilitated by the proliferation of ES in the market.  2.3.4 IoT sensors and connectivity In accordance with ASHRAE Standard 62.1\u20132019, satisfactory indoor air quality entails \"air containing no recognized impurities at detrimental levels, as determined by knowledgeable authorities, and to which a substantial majority (80% or more) of exposed individuals react without discontent\". Nevertheless, several real-world investigations have revealed that structures frequently fail to fulfil even the minimal standardized requisites.  The European Respiratory Society (ERS) has pinpointed particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and carbon dioxide (CO2) as pivotal air pollutants.  To ensure adequate management oh HVAC systems, the monitoring of IAQ holds a crucial role, which can trigger a suitable sequence of actions through real-time feedback to encourage human interventions or by directly activating automated control systems. To address these challenges, forecasting the Air Quality Index (AQI) assumes a pivotal role in managing and curtailing air pollution levels.  IoT represents a wireless network of intelligent sensors linked to the Internet, capable of gathering and transmitting data through embedded devices. Typically, IoT devices consist of five fundamental components: sensors, a processor, a memory module, a communication module, and a power source. The sensors are usually connected via a gateway, which establishes communication with the sensors while also providing storage and processing capabilities. This gateway may be hosted either in the cloud or on the edge.  The generation of time-series data from IoT devices, including sensors, machinery, and robotics, is gaining popularity. These data are swiftly generated by real-world applications such as monitoring air pollution (Joshi, 2008) Subsequently, they are transmitted to a cloud or an edge processing center for further analysis.  Traditionally, the monitoring of indoor air quality has been carried out by experts employing certified reference instruments [N. Castell et al]. However, the high initial cost and large size of such equipment make them unsuitable for widespread and continuous IAQ monitoring in buildings (Castell et al., 2017).  Recent technological progress in metal oxide semiconductors (MOS) for gas detection light scattering for particles, and non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) spectroscopy for carbon dioxide measurement has facilitated the creation of  82  affordable sensors and monitors intended for consumer use. These monitors are typically designed to provide real-time data on air temperature, relative humidity, and various IAQ parameters, often including PM2.5, PM10, CO2, and total VOCs (TVOCs). Certain consumer-grade monitors are equipped with sensors for additional gases like carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, or other metrics such as air pressure and noise level. The readily available consumer-grade monitors commonly store data on Internet of Things (IoT) servers, and the measurements can be accessed through web or mobile applications. The increased market availability of such consumer-grade monitors and single, affordable sensors (devices that measure individual IAQ parameters and transmit data to a logging system) has captured the interest of numerous researchers. Up until now, numerous studies have investigated the effectiveness of affordable sensors and monitors in detecting indoor and outdoor (Z. Wang et al., 2020) particulate matter (PM). (Singer & Delp, 2018) evaluated the capabilities of budget-friendly air quality monitors in identifying fine particles originating from residential sources. They identified a reasonable correlation within a twofold factor for most sources, except for particles with an optical diameter below 0.3 \u03bcm, where there was minimal response. (Singer & Delp, 2018) recently reaffirmed these findings. Other research indicated that the accuracy of integrated PM sensors within consumer-grade monitors can be influenced by air temperature and relative humidity (Bai et al., 2020).  Similarly, the precision of CO2 measurement using low-cost non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensors, commonly found in consumer-grade monitors, was shown to depend on air temperature and relative humidity (Marinov et al., 2018).  Besides direct measurements, certain devices estimate CO2 levels based on total volatile organic compound (TVOC) measurements, resulting in notable inaccuracies (Demanega et al., 2021a). The TVOC measurement itself, conducted with metal oxide semiconductor or photoionization detector (PID) sensors, is prone to cross-sensitivity with interfering compounds. The realm of volatile organic compounds encompasses a wide range of substances, from innocuous cooking scents to hazardous chemicals like aromatics (e.g., benzene, toluene, xylene) and aldehydes (e.g., formaldehyde and acetaldehyde), which renders detecting and monitoring VOCs challenging, along with quantifying exposure. Numerous studies have evaluated sensor performance not only concerning air quality but also encompassing other aspects of the indoor environment, such as thermal comfort. Moreno-Rangel et al. assessed five \"Foobot\" monitors in  83  measuring residential air temperature, relative humidity, PM2.5, CO2, and TVOC. The study found satisfactory accuracy for all sensors except CO2, which wasn't measured by a dedicated sensor but rather derived through an algorithm using TVOC data.  Beyond this research, our understanding of the comprehensive performance of low-cost consumer-grade monitors and sensors remains limited.  The findings obtained from (Demanega et al., 2021b) activities underscore the limitation of using optical light scattering technology in low-cost PM sensors, as it is unable to cover the entire range of particle sizes commonly emitted from indoor sources. (Singer & Delp, 2018) assessed 2 research-grade and 7 consumer-grade monitors, concluding that consumer-grade monitors exhibit semi-quantitative responses (50\u2013200%) to most tested pollutants, while all devices exhibited minimal or no response to events involving particles with an optical threshold of 0.3 \u03bcm. (Z. Wang et al., 2020) study confirmed this, establishing the particle detection limit at around 0.25 \u03bcm. As per specifications, the majority of consumer-grade monitors are designed to detect particles with optical diameters ranging from 0.3 \u03bcm to 2.5 \u03bcm. Depending on the pollutant source and its associated particle size distribution, closer alignment with the reference was observed when the optical particle diameter ranged from 1 \u03bcm to 2.5 \u03bcm, with most tested devices reporting around 50% of the reference concentration at worst. Agreement diminished when sources were dominated by submicron particles (<1 \u03bcm) and during activities generating coarse particles (e.g., vacuuming). Studies also reveal that optical monitors (consumer, professional, and research-grade) might underestimate the mass concentration of larger particles produced by vacuuming, particularly if those particles have higher density.  However, due to the polydisperse nature of indoor particle sources, the response of the majority of sensors exhibited temporal correlation. A robust correlation with reference data was also identified by (J. Li et al., 2020) for the evaluated consumer-grade monitors. This implies that these devices dynamically track concentration changes and can detect events even when quantitative agreement is poor. The analyzed data suggests no consistent bias for PM2.5 sensors. It's important for end-users to recognize that PM data from current low-cost sensors should be interpreted as an indication of a shift in state or a rough estimate, rather than an exact concentration indoor area. TVOCs comprise a wide range of volatile organic compounds, and each pollutant source generates different types of VOCs. A comprehensive study highlighted that TVOC sensors exhibit varying sensitivity to different VOC sources, depending on their working principles (Militello-Hourigan & Miller, 2018). This variability is especially notable in PID sensors, which yield accurate  84  results in laboratory air sampling when measuring specific groups of compounds, they are calibrated for. This variability explains the different responses of monitors and the inconsistent seasonal replication in various experiments. While consumer-grade monitors managed to capture changes in TVOC concentrations over time and could be employed to detect events, users should be informed about the inaccuracies in absolute values. (Nirlo et al., 2015). In all the tested monitors and single sensors, air temperature and relative humidity were found to impact measurement performance. These factors should be considered when interpreting the data. Additionally, variations in particle density from different sources can influence the accuracy of mass concentration measurements. To address this, using source-dependent particle densities and understanding their effects on measurement accuracy is crucial. If sensor was positioned in close proximity to a microcontroller with a power converter within a housing accommodating multiple single acquisition set, the heat generated by the microcontroller likely interfered with the air temperature measurement, leading to overestimated temperature values.  The literature analysis performed provides a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of low-cost consumer-grade monitors and single-parameter sensors in detecting five indoor environmental parameters: particulate matter, carbon dioxide, total volatile organic compounds, dry-bulb air temperature, and relative humidity. Eight experiments were conducted to simulate indoor air pollutant sources under two different climatic conditions: cool and dry, and warm and humid. Regarding PM measurements, even though some devices exhibited Mean Relative Errors (MRE) exceeding 100%, the dynamic responses were time-correlated for most tested devices. This implies that low-cost units could effectively detect changes in particulate matter concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 2.5 \u03bcm. On average, the best-performing monitor deviated by a factor of two from the reference.  In terms of CO2 concentration detection, the majority of devices displayed errors within 25% from the reference for concentrations up to 3,500 ppm. Some of the best monitors achieved a deviation of just 3% from the reference. For total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), low-cost monitors showed strong correlations with professional-grade monitors, despite a lack of precise quantitative agreement. Comparing the two seasons, most consumer-grade monitors exhibited similar performance in both conditions, with some devices slightly closer to the reference in cool and dry conditions for PM and CO2, and in warm and humid conditions for TVOC.  85  The study suggests that recent technological advancements provide an opportunity for more effective indoor air quality control. The majority of tested low-cost consumer-grade monitors could potentially trigger appropriate actions to ensure satisfactory indoor environments. This could be achieved through a feedback loop to encourage human actions or integration into building management systems with automated controllers and devices. Continuous improvement of low-cost monitoring technology is vital to enhance indoor air quality management.  As the field of environmental sensing technology continues to evolve, future research should prioritize several key areas. Firstly, there is a need to delve into the longitudinal performance of these low-cost monitoring units. This involves studying their consistency and accuracy over extended periods of time, which is essential for assessing their reliability in real-world scenarios. Additionally, the development of robust quality control algorithms is crucial. These algorithms should be designed to minimize measurement errors and eliminate biases that might arise from various sources, such as sensor drift, calibration discrepancies, or environmental fluctuations. Such algorithms would contribute to enhancing the accuracy and consistency of the collected data. Furthermore, the establishment of standards and guidelines for the testing of these low-cost monitoring devices is essential. A standardized framework would ensure that these devices undergo thorough and consistent evaluation processes, enabling direct comparisons between different models. This, in turn, would aid consumers, researchers, and decision-makers in making informed choices based on reliable data. In conclusion, the future direction of research in this field should focus on the long-term performance assessment of low-cost sensing units, the development of effective quality control algorithms, and the establishment of standardized testing protocols to ensure the accuracy and reliability of these devices for indoor environmental monitoring.  2.3.5 DT-based IAQ management Digital twins can play a crucial role in addressing these challenges and ensuring the optimal indoor air quality (IAQ) in smart buildings. By creating a digital replica of a building's HVAC system, ventilation, and other environmental parameters, digital twins can offer real-time insights into IAQ performance. This empowers building managers to detect potential problems, such as insufficient ventilation or elevated pollutant levels, in advance of critical situations and optimize the performance of HVAC systems, including temperature and humidity control, to sustain a healthy indoor environment. The system is able to support in making informed decisions regarding maintenance, upgrades, and investments in IAQ enhancements simulating  86  various scenarios and assess their impact on IAQ, aiding in the identification of potential challenges and the development of strategies to address them. This ensures that air quality standards are upheld even in changing conditions. Digital Twins provide a potent solution for achieving and upholding indoor air quality standards in smart buildings, especially concerning SmartScore certification. By offering real-time insights into IAQ performance, digital twins empower building managers to proactively tackle issues, enhance system efficiency, and base decisions on data, ultimately benefiting the health and well-being of occupants. As digital twin technology advances, we can anticipate further innovative applications for enhancing IAQ and overall building performance. Several key factors contribute to the complexity of managing indoor environments in the context of pathogen transmission and incorporate the choice towards a DT system capable of handling complex problems: \uf0a7 Heterogeneity: indoor environments are highly diverse, with various functionalities and characteristics that create distinct habitats for different pathogens. Microbiomes can significantly differ even within the same building, depending on the room's usage. This variability highlights the necessity for tailored, location-specific risk management practices. \uf0a7 Diverse Pathogen Habitats: pathogens can be found in various indoor habitats, such as surfaces, air, and water. These different locations offer unique transmission and exposure pathways. For instance, strategies effective at preventing surface transmission might not be as effective for airborne pathogens. \uf0a7 Occupant Behavior: building occupants play a pivotal role in the transmission and exposure pathways of pathogens, especially in environments with multiple users. Their behaviors, interactions, and movements can influence the risk of infection and pathogen spread. \uf0a7 Disruption vs. Functionality: traditional approaches like prolonged access control and extensive cleaning may reduce pathogen transmission but can also disrupt the standard operations and functionalities of indoor environments. Given the dynamic and interconnected nature of human behavior, pathogen transmission, and building operations in indoor environments, there's a growing need for adaptive and advanced systems. These systems should enable real-time monitoring and control responses to the ever-changing dynamics of the building-human-pathogen system. Digital Twin emerges as a promising approach to address these challenges by providing a comprehensive and adaptable framework for managing indoor environments and mitigating pathogen risks.  87  According to (J. Cai et al., 2023), the DT of the indoor environment can be perceived as the interaction between the buildings\u2019 indoor environment and its digital representation model to provide real-time monitoring, analytics, and control for the environments. Therefore, three literature research clusters that develop key technologies to enable the establishment of DT have been identified, i.e., BIM, IoT sensing, and smart building control through data analytics. Research in the field of Building Information Modeling (BIM) applications for promoting healthy indoor environments has been relatively limited. Typically, this area of study is considered a subset of design performance or facility management, with a focus on managing factors like indoor air quality, daylighting, and ventilation. However, the emergence of COVID-19 has led to increased attention on leveraging BIM to support healthier indoor environments. In a study by (Rice, 2020), 14 building health indicators were identified, including aspects like thermal comfort, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and sound insulation. The potential of BIM models to measure and evaluate these indicators through surveys and assessments was discussed. Most participants in the study agreed that BIM models could be used to measure these indicators. However, there were debates regarding the complexity of measurement for different indicators. Three complexity levels were identified: direct measurement based on BIM models, the need for additional plug-ins, and the requirement for extra sensors and detectors. Some research has delved into specific indicators, such as indoor air quality (Utkucu & S\u00f6zer, 2020) and lighting (Montiel-Santiago et al., 2020), and explored how BIM can facilitate their assessment and monitoring. Beyond indicators perceptible to humans, other studies (Adams et al., 2014) (S. Li et al., 2021)) have taken a building microbiology perspective. They have extracted building information, such as layout, and correlated it with microbial communities identified through advanced sequencing techniques. Overall, while the application of BIM in promoting healthy indoor environments is gaining attention, it remains an evolving field with various complexities related to measuring and assessing different health indicators. The impact of design on microbial risks has been explored in research efforts. For example, (Adams et al., 2014) conducted a study that revealed variations in microbial communities between different types of rooms. Additionally, a pilot study conducted by (S. Li et al., 2021) achieved a groundbreaking integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) with a microbial transmission model, allowing for the assessment of infection risks at the room level. This work has laid the foundation for the integration of BIM with microbial risk assessment as a means to promote health in indoor environments.  88  In essence, the current use of BIM for enhancing healthy indoor environments involves two primary processes. \uf0a7 Integration of BIM data: this process entails extracting information from BIM and combining it with other relevant data to assess health or health-related factors using simulation or data-driven methods. Various studies have employed this approach (e.g., (Sporr et al., 2019) (Kwok et al., 2020), (Gan et al., 2021). \uf0a7 Utilization of BIM Visualization: BIM's visualization capabilities are harnessed to represent and communicate health or health-related factors to users. Researchers and practitioners have employed BIM for this purpose (e.g., (Alavi et al., 2021); (Valinejadshoubi et al., 2021). These processes collectively contribute to leveraging BIM as a tool for enhancing indoor environmental health and microbial risk management. In the context of fostering a healthy indoor environment, Building Performance Simulation (BPS) models are commonly employed, often in conjunction with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques. These models serve the purpose of modeling, assessing, and controlling various aspects of indoor environments, including indoor air quality ((Y. Li et al., 2021) (Stephen Lopez et al., 2021), pathogen transmission (Peng et al., 2020) (Motamedi et al., 2022)), as well as thermal and visual comfort (Cheong et al., 2020). However, a notable limitation of BPS models lies in their representation of occupant behavior, which can significantly impact the accuracy and reliability of simulation results. To address this limitation, Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) has been employed to create more sophisticated models that better capture the dynamic interaction between occupants and indoor environments. ABS can be integrated with BPS models to explore how such interactions influence building performance metrics, including energy consumption and disease transmission (X. Zhou et al., 2020), (Islam et al., 2022). This integration allows for more informed decisions related to building operations and control. Furthermore, Building Information Modeling (BIM), which provides rich spatial and semantic information about building design and operation, has become an indispensable tool in data analytics. BIM is often combined with BPS to enhance the accuracy and reliability of simulation results concerning building performance (Y. Zhou et al., 2021). In the context of smart building control, Digital Twins (DTs) equipped with advanced dynamic modeling capabilities act as the intelligent core.  They take inputs and outputs from digital building models and formulate building control as an optimization problem. Various optimization techniques, such as mixed-integer problems and nonlinear programming, can be effectively  89  employed to solve these problems. Model Predictive Control (MPC) techniques have been implemented in real buildings, demonstrating their ability to enhance building operational practices (Ruusu et al., 2019). The primary focus of DT-enabled smart building controls is to enhance indoor health and environmental comfort while ensuring energy efficiency in building operations. This involves improving various aspects of indoor occupant well-being, including: \uf0a7 Indoor Air Quality (IAQ): DTs, through building modeling and indoor/outdoor air quality monitoring, enable optimal ventilation by switching ventilation modes and adjusting ventilation rates. This results in reduced indoor air pollutant concentrations and energy savings in ventilation operations (W. Kim et al., 2016), (Cho et al., 2015). \uf0a7 Controlled Indoor Air Pollutants: Various air pollutants like CO2, Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOCs), respiratory particles, and ozone are managed simultaneously (Ganesh et al., 2019), Afroz et al., 2020b), (Saini et al., 2020a) Effective deployment of indoor environmental sensors is essential for efficient indoor air pollutant management (Zeng et al., 2020) \uf0a7 Occupant Behavior Modeling: Occupant behaviors play a crucial role in effective indoor air pollutant management, especially in demand-controlled ventilation strategies that rely on accurate occupancy information (W. Wang et al., 2018). Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been increased attention on methods to control airborne infections. Smart ventilation strategies, encompassing both mechanical and natural ventilation, along with occupancy adjustments, have been proposed to mitigate virus transmission risks in building operations (Xu et al., 2021). Furthermore, in pursuit of energy efficiency, smart lighting control strategies have been developed to optimize lighting operation schedules based on environmental conditions and occupancy, ensuring satisfactory indoor illuminance levels without unnecessary energy consumption (Kandasamy et al., 2018) In line with broader sustainability goals, building DTs are being leveraged to integrate renewable energy sources and support demand response initiatives. These DTs utilize system-sensing data to facilitate the harmonious integration of renewable energy, energy storage (e.g., thermal or battery storage), and building operations, considering both power generation and occupant requirements Biyik & Kahraman, 2019),(Kathirgamanathan et al., 2021) In summary, DT-enabled smart building controls are instrumental in optimizing building performance across various facets, from indoor air quality and occupant  90  comfort to energy efficiency and sustainability, thus fostering healthier and more efficient indoor environments. In essence, a DT for a healthy indoor environment serves as a comprehensive and dynamic platform that continuously monitors, models, assesses, and controls various factors to promote both environmental sustainability and occupant well-being as shown in Figure  15.   Figure  15. DT and IoT reference architecture for IAQ management The progression of IoT sensing is anticipated to furnish unparalleled real-time data encompassing all facets of the indoor environment. To attain this, it is imperative to develop novel, economical sensors for the direct identification of microbiome populations (e.g., pathogens). Furthermore, it is necessary to devise methodologies for the optimal setup of sensors to guarantee precision in measurements while also enhancing cost-effectiveness. Modern technologies, including edge devices and privacy-preserving sensors, ought to be harnessed in IoT sensing to safeguard both security and privacy. In the future, in the context of a healthy indoor environment, Building Information Modeling (BIM) should evolve into an integrated assessment and simulation platform. Its primary role would be to furnish actionable insights for building control systems by amalgamating information encompassing the environment, occupants, and microbiome. These insights would be derived from multi-disciplinary simulations covering domains such as energy usage, air quality, and pathogen transmission. A significant challenge in this context is ensuring data interoperability. The adoption of an Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)-based system development approach could potentially address this issue. Moving forward, it is crucial to identify information requirements and clarify the process of information exchange. Regarding real-time sensory data, future BIM systems are expected to undergo continuous updates to ensure that simulations remain calibrated. In addition to its role in assessment and simulation for smart building control, a closed-loop design framework is essential. This framework should enable the identification  91  of relationships between indoor environmental attributes and health indicators, ultimately guiding building design. The prevailing paradigm of smart building control, which primarily emphasizes energy efficiency and occupant comfort, needs to expand its scope. It should acquire the capacity to ensure environmental health and mitigate infection risks. To achieve this, it is imperative to quantify the relationship between building operations (e.g., ventilation and surface disinfection) and infection risk, thereby enabling bio-informed adaptive control. Moreover, occupants play a pivotal role as active components within the indoor environment. Their behavior significantly influences the transmission of infectious diseases. Consequently, building control strategies must take into account the interactions among occupants and between occupants and the environment. In this scenario, advanced data analytics is a fundamental component of digital twinning for a healthy indoor environment. It offers valuable insights that support the other three techniques mentioned. Novel methodologies that leverage rich, real-time sensor data, building design and operation data, and external contextual data are required. These methodologies should strategically integrate physics-based simulations and data-driven analyses for modeling the complex relationships among the environment, occupants, and pathogens. Furthermore, there is a need to establish quantifiable relationships between environmental factors and human health.  2.3.6 Open challenges This section delves into the primary challenges associated with Digital Twins (DT) and discusses them in four distinct parts: \uf0a7 Data Analysis and Data Access: the existing IT infrastructure often falls short in supporting data analysis within a DT environment. DTs inherently require advanced infrastructures to enable efficient data analysis. In essence, the success of DT relies on a robust and interconnected IT foundation. High-performance GPUs can be employed for this purpose. Cloud service providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google offer substantial resources, but using cloud services for data analysis still presents significant security challenges. Edge computing emerges as a potential solution to mitigate data transmission delays, increase bandwidth, and enable rapid and accurate data exchange and analysis.  \uf0a7 Connectivity within the DT Framework: the Internet of Things (IoT) technology facilitates connectivity within the DT framework. However, despite advancements such as the emergence of 5G technology,  92  connectivity-related challenges persist, including software errors and power outages during real-time monitoring. The presence of missing data can substantially impact algorithm performance, necessitating methods to recover lost data and establish complete connections.  \uf0a7 Security: security and privacy pose notable challenges in the realm of advanced technologies. In the context of DT, the sheer volume of data and information exchange presents cybersecurity risks, including the potential for cyberattacks. Adherence to updates in privacy and security laws is imperative for DTs. Establishing a secure platform is paramount and results in a highly reliable digital environment. Blockchain technology, with its secure and decentralized structure, can effectively address security concerns by providing a secure framework for data and information exchange among agents.  \uf0a7 Standardization: standardization is another significant challenge associated with DTs that can potentially hinder their development. The adoption of standardized formats is essential for defining, storing, and executing DT models, fostering interoperability and integration among different DTs. In complex systems like hub energy systems, where multiple infrastructures (e.g., electricity, water, gas) coexist, a unified platform is required to enable seamless interoperability between these systems. This challenge can be addressed through technologies such as Semantic Web or by employing a DT definition language to establish common standards and ensure effective communication and integration among DTs.             93     94            Chapter 3                    Methodology    Historically, managing energy grids and monitoring indoor air quality relied on manual readings, rudimentary sensors, and often, human intuition. The limitations were evident \u2013 lack of real-time monitoring, reactive instead of proactive responses, and a heavy dependence on human intervention.  Traditional approaches to energy microgrids and IAQ have had their share of inefficiencies, often reliant on manual readings, basic sensors, and human judgment. The pitfalls were evident \u2013 latency in real-time monitoring, reactive strategies, and intensive human oversight. Yet, with interconnected devices, the Internet of Things (IoT), and robust analytical platforms, the proposition of constructing an insightful digital representation of these systems has emerged. However, with the rise of interconnected devices, the Internet of Things (IoT), and powerful analytical platforms, the prospect of creating a real-time, self-learning digital representation of these systems became plausible. This led to the exploration of integrating data platforms with machine learning to forge an intelligent Digital Twin. Methodology 95  As a Digital Twin, at its core, is a dynamic software representation of a physical entity or system the digital counterpart mirrors the real-world system in real-time, capturing its every nuance. By harnessing the data generated by IoT devices and sensors, it provides a platform for analysis, understanding behaviors, and predicting future trends. In the context of energy microgrids and IAQ, envision a comprehensive digital representation that not only displays real-time data but also predicts potential failures, recommends optimization strategies, and continually learns from new data. Data is the core component of a Digital Twin. The more data it ingests, the clearer its representation becomes. By seamlessly integrating various data platforms, we ensure that every sensor, every meter, and every IoT device feeds into the Digital Twin. This integration, often cloud-based, guarantees scalability, redundancy, and real-time data acquisition. For instance, in monitoring a microgrid, data from solar panels, wind turbines, battery storage, and demand meters are continually funneled into the digital counterpart. Likewise, for IAQ, sensors capturing temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, and volatile organic compounds stream data in real-time. In this scenario, the integration of machine learning offers a transformative edge to the Digital Twin. Instead of merely showcasing real-time data, the system begins to 'learn' patterns, recognize anomalies, and make predictions. In the microgrid context, the Digital Twin might predict a demand surge based on historical data and recommend energy storage strategies. For IAQ, it could forecast a decline in air quality and preemptively suggest ventilation strategies or adjustments to HVAC systems. This predictive capability not only ensures efficient operations but also prolongs the lifespan of physical assets by averting potential failures. The proposed approach integrating data platforms and machine learning presents several innovations. Unlike traditional systems that viewed microgrids and IAQ as separate entities, the Digital Twin provides an integrated, holistic view, capturing the intricate interplay between energy consumption and indoor air quality. As such, instead of reacting to failures or declines in IAQ, the system becomes proactive, offering solutions before issues manifest and as the Digital Twin ingests more data, its machine learning algorithms refine themselves, becoming more accurate in predictions and recommendations. The Digital Twin relies heavily on quantitative modeling, a bedrock of scientific research. By mathematically representing physical systems, predictions and analyses are based on rigorous, replicable methods. A critical aspect of scientific  96  methodology is the feedback loop \u2013 the ability to adjust hypotheses and predictions based on new data. Digital Twins inherently adopt this methodology, constantly refining their algorithms based on new data influx. The proposed approach introduces the integration of data platforms and machine learning in constructing a Digital Twin as a paradigm shift in how we perceive and manage microgrids and IAQ. This data-driven approach not only optimizes operations but also pioneers a future where our systems are self-aware, predictive, and continually evolving.  2.4 Review of Machine Learning-based and Data-driven strategies The present section is aimed at discussing Machine Learning algorithms usable to assess one of the main objectives of the present research, which is the energy balance of a building, considering electrical loads, power production devices, HVAC systems and people needs and habits. Nowadays, Machine Learning has been widely adopted for improving building energy efficiency and flexibility thanks to the ever-increasing availability of massive building operational data. However, it is difficult for end-users to understand and trust Machine Learning tools because of their black-box nature. To this end, the interpretability of Machine Learning models is attracting ever more attention from the scientific and industrial community because it helps users in understanding the decisions made by these models. It is well known that building sector is one of the major contributors to global energy consumption and carbon emissions. It is accounted that about 36% of the global energy consumption and the 37% of CO2 emissions comes from this sector (OECD/IEA, 2019; Zarco-Peri\u00f1\u00e1n et al., 2022). Moreover, throughout the entire life cycle of a building, the operation phase accounts for 80% \u2212 90% of total energy consumption (Ramesh et al., 2010). Considering these data is evident how much the building sector impact on global warming, the reduction of consumption is therefore crucial for global energy-saving and to reach carbon neutrality as advised by Sustainable Development Goals (Leal Filho et al., 2022; Parra-Dom\u00ednguez et al., 2022) proposed by United Nation and for the 55% CO2 reduction target by 2030 recommended in the New Green Deal (Kazak, 2022). In this framework, Building Automation Systems (BASs) could play an essential role in improving energy efficiency and flexibility. It is possible to implement inside a BASs various smart control strategies for building energy management, such as Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) controls, energy storage and renewable energy monitoring systems, smart lighting and so on (Hurtado et al., 2018; H. Tang et al., 2021). Traditionally, the control approaches were developed using rule-based control strategies based on physical analyses Methodology 97  and experience. However, this sometimes results in great challenges due to the complicated interactions among building energy systems (Y. Chen, Chen, et al., 2022). Nowadays, thanks to the wide diffusion of Internet of Things technology it is possible to get real-time data of the building environment with few efforts and expenses. Therefore, such data can be integrated inside big-data platforms to evaluate innovative control strategies using Data Science.  Machine Learning models can bring new way of data interpretation discovering and learning directly from the environment the actual needs and requirements of the building, adapting in almost real time to the changes present in the building. This new approach is called \u201cdata-driven\u201d and is considered as the paradigm of digitalization (Capozzoli et al., 2016; Marotta et al., 2021). With such data-driven models, building can be monitored to make decisions autonomously with and without human intervention (Sengupta & Chandrashekhar, 2021). At least, the possibility of integrating real-time data with geometrical information coming from the project phase (as from Building Information Modelling) brings great value to the Digital Twin technology, as the digital construct is able to replicate and simulate the behaviour of a building in real-time. Machine Learning is therefore a fundamental technology for the future of the buildings sector and shall be considered as a building component itself. Machine learning has effectively facilitated building energy management developed during the last years as evidenced by many studies and applications present in literature (Z. Chen et al., 2023). This includes, load and power prediction, Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) and occupancy-related applications.   2.4.1 Load and Power prediction Load prediction refers to the ability of a Machine Learning model to predict the cooling/heating/electricity demand in the future hours or days, while power prediction aims to predict the power generation of equipment such as photovoltaic (PV) panels, wind turbines or other power generation devices. The development of accurate prediction tool for power management is aimed at the optimization of the energy efficiency and flexibility inside the building (L. Zhang et al., 2021). As an example, with a demand-side model it is possible to improve the flexibility of the building energy system by balancing the supply and the demand in real-time using as much as possible renewable energy sources. Instead, with a model predictive control it is possible to operate power equipment (set-point, thermal comfort, lighting) basing on minimal cost of energy consumption logics. Therefore, the choice of the model depends on what is the model\u2019s goal and from what it is installed in the building, if there are straight constraints on power system operations a demand-side model is  98  advisable, instead, if the goal is to reduce the global energy usage, a model predictive control is better suited (Y. Chen, Guo, et al., 2022).  Such models require historicized data instead of a physical-based load model (energy equations, equipment information, etc). Therefore, its development is quicker, but it is necessary to have historical operative data available (Z. Chen, Chen, et al., 2022).  Between the different Machine Learning algorithms Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), tree-based methods, and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) autoregressive models are the most suitable, as evidenced by many literature studies (L. Zhang et al., 2021). ANN are very suitable to cope with complex real-world problems such as for solar radiation prediction (Bahani et al., 2020) or for heating/cooling efficiency (Le et al., 2019). Moreover, ANN are quite more flexible not depending on linear approximations and being independent from binary logics as for tree-based methods. DNN instead, seems to be very promising in load demand prediction, especially if coped with Long Short-Term Memory layers (LSMT) (G. Li et al., 2022).  2.4.2 Fault Detection and Diagnosis Fault Detection and Diagnosis is another widely discussed topic because it is essential to maintain building efficiency, especially when energy-intensive loads are installed (such as chillers and heaters). Using Machine Learning it is possible to monitor device status and life cycle using self-learning energy signature models independently from the specific device. Some examples of applications employ Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Deep Generative Systems (Ciaburro, 2022). ANN and CNN are the most suitable ones due to their flexibility and capacity to self-learning from data.  2.4.3 Occupancy-related applications At least, occupancy-related applications refer to the problems related to the presence of people inside an environment. As an example, occupant thermal comfort is occupancy-related applications directly connected to the HVAC system and the use of accurate Machine Learning models can improve indoor comfort yet reducing energy consumptions. Using Machine Learning based models instead of Predicted Means Vote (PVM) (Yau & Chew, 2014) it was demonstrated that it is possible to reduce energy consumption more than 58% and CO2 emissions up to 24% (Qavidel Fard et al., 2022). This is possible thanks to the occupancy level prediction and activity recognition that are two branches of Computer Vision models that uses Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence models to determine the number of people in an environment and Methodology 99  their activity. HVAC consumption could be reduced up to 23% using Machine Learning for occupancy predictions and up to a more 20% using activity recognition (Dai et al., 2020; Javed et al., 2018). IoT plays a fundamental role in this field obtaining real-time and historicized data of a parameter which is difficult to be evaluated.  2.4.4 Interpretability of Machine Learning models One of the main problems occurring when a Machine Learning model is used is the capability of interpreting what data affect the process, its performances and which features influences the predictions. Sometimes this can go over the human comprehension and the efforts to get understandable data could not worth the use of Machine Learning tools (Rudin et al., 2022). An example of interpretability issue is electrical equipment fault detection whereby the use of ANN. Although, the problem is well defined but the data that affects the process input and/output is not easy to define and can vary depending on the device. This can reduce a machine learning model application due to its lack of interpretability. ANN the structure of inputs is well clear by the developer but how the data is elaborated by the model is dark. Neural networks are made of a big number of hidden layers that are trained on the dataset and which output is usually not understandable. Moreover, as the number of layers increase (Deep Neural Networks) the model becomes deeper and darker. However, it is possible to employ simpler models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-NN and regressors. The tradeoff is the accuracy of the output, that is usually less if compared to most complex models. The lack of interpretability is one of the main challenges for Machine Learning in real-world applications (Burkart & Huber, 2021). This issue is commonly connected to the lack of the physical knowledge of the process and the presence of incomplete or bad structured data (Yan et al., 2018). Figure  16 shows the correlation between the interpretability and accuracy of Machine Learning techniques for interpretable and black-box models.  100   Figure  16. Correlation between the interpretability and accuracy of a Machine Learning models for interpretable and black box models Therefore, decision-makers may find the ML untrustworthy if the models are not trained on real operational data. Moreover, the actual performance of models could be worse than on the training data. Another issue is due to the black-box nature of ML models because they produce output without any explanations. Decision-makers usually need insights into how and why models produce such predictions so that they can understand, control, and apply the models. This leads to skepticism in the building industry about the application of ML. Therefore, it is advisable to generate reasonable interpretations that explain the original ML model without oversimplifying essential details or sacrificing prediction performance. The issue is graphically explained in Figure  17.  Figure  17. Interpretable Machine Learning model trust example for HVAC systems. Interpretability can be local or global depending on the scope of model output that needs to be interpreted. Global interpretation explains an ML model based on a full view of the model structures and parameters. In contrast, local interpretation explains each prediction individually. This means that global models provide a holistic understanding of the model itself by measuring the global effects of input parameters on the predictions. This is important for decision making because it gives a macro-level understanding of the prevision process, as example, explaining what features are most significant in predicting Methodology 101  energy consumption. Instead, local models provide a transparent understanding of the prediction for a specific input. These models focus on the effects of every single input on the result. Differently from global models, this is important for decision making to trust the output and to understand if it is current or wrong. As an example, local models can explain the effect on external air temperature on HVAC power consumption and efficiency. Figure  18 summarize what is intended as global and local interpretability level.   Figure  18. Local and Global interpretation using as example k-means (a) and tree-classifier (b) models. There are two types of Machine Learning families defined as Ante-Hoc and Post-Hoc, the division is based on where the models are applied in the data elaboration process: \uf0b7 Ante-hoc Machine Learning models are applied during the training process,  \uf0b7 Post-Hoc Machine Learning models are applied after the training process. Ante-hoc models are also called intrinsic or transparent models. For example, a linear regression is a simple ante-hoc model for predicting a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables (El Fiorenza Caroline et al., 2019). The model is self-explanatory because it makes predictions using a linear combination of the input variables, which can be easily understood and explained (Kamath & Liu, 2021). Although linear regression is high interpretable, it is somehow too simple to address complicated problems in building energy management (Sha et al., 2021). Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) is a more suitable variant of linear regression with strong flexibility and interoperability for regression and classification roles (Zhuang et al., 2021).  Instead, Post-hoc models are applied as a black box after their training. They are used to interpret and understand the dependency and significance of an input over the output without the need to understand the internal structures. They are aimed at generating interpretation by examining the interrelationship between input features and the predictions without knowing how the process is developed (Friston & Penny, 2011; Vilone & Longo, 2021).   102  The graphical representation of Figure  19 shows post-hoc and ante-hoc implementation in an example of Machine Learning working flow; On the left is visible the ante-hoc flow, where the flow skips the surrogate model fitting going directly to the evaluation step. Instead, in the right is represented the post-hoc schematic, where the flow is implemented in a black-box model that shall be evaluated somehow as a global result. It shall be noted that it is also possible to concatenate a black-box model with an interpretable model in a single logic flow where post and ante data elaboration steps are performed. However, the possibility of obtaining both the advantages of the two workflows is not guaranteed and depends on the specific surrogate model implemented.  Figure  19. Ante-hoc (left) and Post-hoc (right) Machine Learning flows implementation Going forward, Machine Learning techniques can be agnostic depending on their structure. As example, a Machine Learning technique can be intended as a single component that can be used into any Machine Learning model independently from the model as showed in Figure  20. Others can only be used to interpret certain types of models and are thus called model-specific techniques. The first is called model agnostic technique, the second model specific technique. Model-agnostic techniques can be applied to any ML model because they require only the input and output of the ML model without considering its inner structures. Usually, post-hoc models are also model-agnostic. An example of such technique is Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) a post-hoc model agnostic technique that can approximate any Machine Learning model locally. Instead, model-specific techniques are more specific on the architecture of the ML model, providing in-depth interpretability that may not be possible with model-agnostic methods. For example, the attention mechanism is usually employed in neural networks to improve interpretability as a model-specific technique. Methodology 103   Figure  20. Model agnostic and model specific Machine Learning techniques  2.4.5 Evaluation of interpretability Between scientific community there is no consensus about what interpretability is and how to measure it (F. L. Fan et al., 2021). However, Robnik-\u0160ikonja & Bohanec proposed an evaluation method based on three main levels as described (Figure  21) (Robnik-\u0160ikonja & Bohanec, 2018):   Figure  21. Interpretability levels as proposed by Robnik-\u0160ikonja & Bohanec  1. Application-level (real task): The explanation is made at the end of the process and its quality is tested by the end user. As an example, a Machine Learning crack detection software can locate and marks them in images. At the application level, the end-user can test the crack detection software directly to evaluate the model. This requires a good experimental setup and a good understanding of how to assess quality of the output. Therefore, the quality of the evaluation relay on how good the end user is at explaining the same decision. 2. Human-level (simple task) is a simplified application-level evaluation. The difference is that these experiments are not carried out with the domain experts, but with anyone. This makes experiments cheaper (because it is not necessary to get and expert) and it is easier to find  104  more testers. In this case many explanations can be produced by the Machine Learning software and the uses chose the best one. However, this method somehow is limited by the user experience and its capacity to get the correct choice, therefore, it is not suitable for complex tasks where an expert is of mandatory importance for the output evaluation. 3. Function-level (proxy task) does not require a user. This method works when the model has been already evaluated by someone else in a human-level evaluation or in application-level evaluation. For example, it might be known that the end users understand decision trees. In this case, a proxy for explanation quality may be the depth of the tree. Shorter trees would get a better explain score.   2.5 Models and techniques for energy assessment and optimization  The actual panorama of ML models is quite wide, with many variants developed for specific tasks. However, they can be organized basing on the task they have to perform, the type of learning and the related input data (Sarker, 2021a). The classification is shown in Figure  22.   Figure  22. Machine Learning models\u2019 classification based on learning type and tasks to perform (Sarker, 2021b) Generally, it is possible to describe data types as following: \uf0a7 Structured: input data must be well-defined and structured, with information organized and described at detail level. For instance, device names, times, power, temperatures, locations, occupancy, etc. are examples of structured data. \uf0a7 Unstructured: if the data has no pre-defined format or organization, it is considered as unstructured. This makes the analysis of relevant information much more difficult to perform. For instance, textual input, word processing, audio files, videos, images, etc. can be considered as unstructured data. Methodology 105  \uf0a7 Semi-structured: data are not stored in an organized structure (such as a relation-al database), but it has some organizational properties. For instance, XML, JSON documents, NoSQL databases, etc., are examples of semi-structured data. Moreover, input data can be associated also with metadata information that can be considered either as structured, unstructured, or semi-structured. Before choosing a ML model it is important to understand the structure of input data. Moving to interpretability, the data structure is related to the knowledge of the process. Usually, it is recommendable to use structured or semi-structured data especially when using ante hoc models that are intrinsically interpretable. If data is well structured, it is possible to easily get a higher level of interpretability (level 2-3) because the process is repeatable with less issues related to the model\u2019s accuracy, and it is necessary a lesser insight on the specific process analysed (Franchini et al., 2022). However, this rise the importance of having good interpretability for the other data structure (semi-structured and unstructured). Hereafter, the most used interpretable ML models for energy management in built environment are discussed with examples based on the scientific literature on the matter.  2.5.1 Artificial Neural Networks Artificial Neural Networks are widely diffused across the scientific and industrial community because they are quite easy to use and to adapt on different contexts. ANN are developed to mimic the neural brain structure by using mathematical models made of nodes and connections. Although, they are ante-hoc models usually difficult to interpretate due to their black-box nature. However, during the last years due to their wide diffusion and interest have been developed modified ANN with an enhanced interpretability. As an example, adding element with a physical meaning to the models. (A. Li et al., 2021) developed an innovative ANN integrating a GRAvitation model (GRA) with a Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) model to predict building consumption. The weights of the ANN have been determined using the mutual information obtained by the two models. H. Wang et al. proposed a Direct eXplainable Neural Network (DXNN) using ridge function instead of sigmoid to weight the network nodes (H. Wang et al., 2020). Using such different kernel, it was possible to obtain the direct relationship between model\u2019s input and output. They apply their model to calculate solar irradiance. Moving to occupancy detection, X. Zhang et al. combined a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy classifier with a Deep Neural Network to generate fuzzy rules for occupancy (X. Zhang et al., 2020). Another approach to the problem has been developed by E. Kim that proposed an Interpretable Convolutional Neural Network (I-CNN) for indoor activity detection by adding temporal convolution and pooling layers into a CNN (E. Kim, 2020). Using an  106  Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) network, L. Li et al. proposed a modified neural network can reveal the relationship between input features and model output (L. Li et al., 2019). As a result, they showed how the day hour was the most influential feature for hourly electricity prediction. Another way to increase the interpretability of ANN is using the physical domain knowledge to guide networks training process. Z. Chen, Xiao, et al., used this methodology to predict the performances of air-conditioning units (Z. Chen, Xiao, et al., 2022). Z. Yu et al. concluded that a knowledge-based search strategy could significantly reduce ANN training time (Z. Yu et al., 2020). Y. Chen & Zhang proposed a modified Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) using thermal dynamics parameters for modelling building thermal performance, the developed network can learn interpretable dynamic models from measurement data (Y. Chen & Zhang, 2021). Following this approach, Di Natale et al. proposed a physically consistent neural network by incorporating domain knowledge into an ANN for building thermal modelling (Di Natale et al., 2022). The proposed approach was proved to be physically interpretable.   2.5.2 Encoder-Decoder Encoder models take an input sequence and creates a contextual representation (which is also called context) of it, instead, decoder models take this contextual representation as input and generates output sequence. Therefore, Enecoder-Decorer models uses textual or categorial input to generate categorical or textual output. A very famous example of Encoder-Decoder model is Google Translator that generates text decoding a textual input (Daza & Frank, 2019). Recently, the attention mechanist has been included inside Encoder-Decoder models to increase machine-machine translation performances and the human interpretability of the output  (Bahdanau et al., 2015). Attention mechanism is aimed at mimicking the cognitive attention. It can be made using \"soft\" weights for the Machine Learning models. Moreover, the weights can change during each runtime, in contrast to \u201chard\u201d weights that are pre-trained and fine-tuned. This is made by stressing a part of input feature while weakening the others. Encoder-decoder models can use time-series data therefore the attention mechanism should consider time-series data (C. Li et al., 2022). Many studies have used the attention mechanism to analyse temporal dependency in time-series data in both regression and classification tasks. A chiller fault diagnosis (FDD) model has been developed by D. Li et al. to analyse the temporal dependency of time-series data and removing redundant features, thus providing a local interpretation of the sensor data. (D. Li et al., 2019). Instead, Azam & Younis developed an encoder-decoder model for the prediction of energy consumption demonstrating the importance of historical feature inputs on model output (Azam & Younis, 2021).  Methodology 107  2.5.3 Clustering and feature extraction Clustering models are aimed at classifying input data into clusters that shares a common feature, instead, feature extraction is aimed at transforming raw data into numerical features that can be processed while preserving the information in the original dataset. As an example, measuring the dimension of leaves with a clustering model is possible to organize them by the plant species, using a feature extraction model is possible to analyse which feature is plant specific. Unlike ANN and encoder-decoder techniques, clustering and feature extraction can be integrated inside any black-box models without the need to modify their structure. As example, A. Grimaldo & Novak showed that it is possible to use k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithms obtaining the same performances of more sophisticated machine learning models such as Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT) to predict energy usage in buildings (A. Grimaldo & Novak, 2021). Due to their aim of organizing and reducing the data complexity dividing it into groups or extracting relevant information these models are highly interpretable (Vigneau, 2021). An innovative clustering technique that is aimed to simulating building thermal design data was developed by Bhatia et al. (Bhatia et al., 2019). Their approach is called axis-aligned hyper-rectangles and can cluster information dividing data into hyper-rectangle boundaries interpretable with specific rules. Using such techniques authors created rules for the range of window-to-wall ratio, to assist the design of building envelopes in different climate zones. The case study developed by Laurinec & Luck\u00e1 was aimed at developing interpretable time-series for power load forecasting (Laurinec & Luck\u00e1, 2019). As a result they showed that it is possible to extract interpretable features from moving windows of time-series data improving demand forecast accuracy.  Time-series data can be analysed by Highly Comparative Time-Series Analysis (HCTSA) toolkit to generate interpretable time-series features. The works of Miller and Xiao showed that it is possible to classify the space usage using building energy consumption data by clustering models (Miller, 2019; T. Xiao et al., 2022). Kasuya obtained the load prediction of the next day using a Gaussian mixture model and a distribution-based clustering algorithm on energy usage data (Kasuya et al., 2020). Z. Chen et al. generated mode labels as input features using a novel early classification approach to enhance the interpretability and performance of building load prediction (Z. Chen et al., 2021). Data visualization is also a common tool used to improve Machine Learning interpretability for clustering and feature extraction models. A. I. Grimaldo & Novak developed a smart energy dashboard to visualize energy consumption on similar day to increase user understanding of energy consumptions (A. I. Grimaldo & Novak, 2019). The dashboard was fed by data obtained from kNN and Decision Trees (DT). They also developed a radar chart  108  dynamic figure to compare weather parameters during similar days (A. I. Grimaldo & Novak, 2019).  2.5.4 Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) was born as a variant of Linear Regression and Logistic Regression models. Differently from them, GAMs are more generalized but maintains a good degree of interpretability, they can model any non-linear additive effects on different features (Kamath & Liu, 2021).  Moreover, GAMs can incorporate irregular and volatile effects to improve flexibility in handling high-resolution data (Khamma et al., 2020). As an example, Khamma et al. showed that it is possible to predict heat and power production using ambient air temperature, solar radiation, and hour of the day as input data (Khamma et al., 2020). The outdoor air temperature had a negative linear relation with heating load prediction, while solar radiation had a negative exponential relationship. In addition, GAMs were also applied to perform sensitivity analysis of input features in thermal comfort modelling (Charalampopoulos, 2019), thermal energy storage modelling (Voss et al., 2021),  to identify operational patterns of gas using HVAC systems (Pathak et al., 2018), distributed PV power prediction (Sundararajan & Ollis, 2021), and short-term energy prediction in buildings (Khamma et al., 2020). The main drawback of GAMs is their simplicity that cannot be compared to more complex models but can only approximate the real behaviour of the system analysed. Therefore, GAMs are more suitable for continuous data that don\u2019t have high variability in the dataset.  2.5.5 Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) In 2016, Ribeiro et al. introduced LIME as a model-agnostic method designed to provide localized interpretations for individual predictions (Ribeiro et al., 2016). This approach involves training a local surrogate model to approximate the characteristics of a black-box model in the vicinity of a specific prediction sample. LIME is particularly valuable for explaining classification problems, as it can provide both contradictory and supportive information for each input feature in relation to a given prediction. Wastensteiner et al. applied LIME to interpret machine learning-based time-series classification models in the context of building energy consumption (Wastensteiner et al., 2021). They also conducted an analysis to assess the stability and reliability of these interpretations.  Madhikermi et al., utilized LIME to increase the interpretability of context for Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for Air Methodology 109  Handling Unit (AHU) fault diagnosis (FDD), selecting six random samples for demonstration purposes (Madhikermi et al., 2019). Srinivasan et al. conducted experiments using LIME for chiller FDD, including issues such as scaling in condenser fins, sensor errors caused by flow pulsations, and false alarms (S. Srinivasan et al., 2021). LIME's ability to provide contradicting and supporting information plays a dual role: it assists decision-makers in understanding the model's output, aiding in fault identification, and also helping for the identification of potential false alarms generated by the black-box model. While LIME is often associated with classification tasks, it is also applicable to regression problems. Carlsson et al. for instance, integrated the contradicting and supporting values into a single metric to evaluate the confidence level of individual predictions related to chiller COP (Coefficient of Performance) efficiency, distinguishing between low and high efficiency cases (Carlsson et al., 2020).   2.5.6 SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) SHAP is designed as a tool for local interpretability, however, it can be employed also for global interpretation. For instance, Carlsson et al. leveraged the average SHAP values to determine feature importance in an ANN model, uncovering key features affecting energy consumption (Carlsson et al., 2019, 2020). Similarly, Ugwuanyi employed averaged SHAP values to globally interpret CO2 prediction (Ugwuanyi, 2021). Much like LIME, SHAP is useful for the evaluation of influential factors in fault detection scenarios. In S. Park et al. work, SHAP elucidated both local and global interpretations of Random Forest (RF) for Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) for district heating systems (S. Park et al., 2020). Gao et al. used SHAP to interpret RF and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models for chiller FDD (Gao et al., 2022). In a different context, Sakkas et al. employed XGBoost to detect fraudulent electricity consumption (Sakkas et al., 2021). Additionally, M. Wang et al. used a SHAP model to interpret time-series classification for building energy consumption (M. Wang et al., 2022). SHAP model can be also used for occupancy-related tasks, such as for CO2 concentration prediction (Ugwuanyi, 2021). W. Zhang, Wen, et al., adopted SHAP to provide local interpretations for thermal comfort evaluation calculating the individual Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) outputs in a complex numerical equations-based thermal comfort model (W. Zhang, Wen, et al., 2021). Moreover, using SHAP values, the authors proposed a potential solution to enhance thermal comfort across different weather scenarios. H. Park & Park used SHAP values to rank feature importance for predicting natural ventilation rates (H. Park & Park, 2021). The most influential features included pressure differences, outdoor temperature, and wind speed. Additionally, the authors offered individual SHAP value plots for local  110  interpretation. Yang et al., developed a SHAP model to evaluate three thermal sensation models hot, neutral, and cold showing how air temperature and relative humidity are the most influential features across all three models (Y. Yang et al., 2022).  Moving to building energy benchmarking, SHAP helps pinpoint key features contributing to high or low energy usage intensity in individual buildings. As example in the work of Papadopoulos & Kontokosta, SHAP has been in a XGBoost-based residential building energy benchmarking (Papadopoulos & Kontokosta, 2019). SHAP values identified unit density as the strongest predictor for energy use intensity in residential buildings, followed closely by the property value and the number of floors.  SHAP is also very used in load/power prediction applications. For example, Chang et al. utilized SHAP to analyse and reveal feature importance in PV power generation models (TS-SOM and XGBoost) (Chang et al., 2020). Their results highlighted global horizontal irradiance as the most influential feature, aligning with Pearson Correlation (PC) analyses. (Movahedi & Derrible, 2021) delved into interpreting and interrelating three prediction models (electricity, water, and gas consumption) using SHAP. They discovered that the type of building (residential or commercial) and water consumption were key features influencing electricity prediction, showing a strong interrelationship between gas and water consumption due to gas usage in water heating. By examining SHAP values from an XGBoost model, Chakraborty et al. deduced that single-family homes were likely to experience a more substantial increase in building cooling energy consumption in the context of global climate change (Chakraborty et al., 2021). They also found that buildings in hot-humid zones will consume more energy for cooling due to global warming.  In a different context, Golizadeh Akhlaghi et al. used SHAP to interpret performance-related indexes (cooling capacity, Coefficient of Performance (COP), and wet/dew point efficiency) for a dew point cooler using DNN (Golizadeh Akhlaghi et al., 2021). For instance, a sample exhibited higher cooling capacity than the base value due to relatively high intake air velocity. Lastly, using SHAP model Lu et al. spotlighted load and solar generation one hour ahead, along with solar irradiance, as the top three influential features for predicting distributed PV power one hour ahead (Y. Lu et al., 2021).   2.5.7 Other techniques There are also other techniques different from the aforementioned. For instance, permutation importance can assess feature importance by shuffling feature values and observing the impact on model predictions. A feature is deemed important if its shuffling leads to a substantial prediction error. Carlson et al. Methodology 111  used permutation importance to evaluate feature importance in an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for electricity prediction (Carlsson et al., 2019, 2020). However, like Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), permutation importance can be biased when features exhibit strong correlations. Another approach taken by C. Zhang et al. involved the use of a Dimensionless Sensitivity Index (DSI) to quantify feature importance (C. Zhang et al., 2020). Their results indicated that time-lagged cooling load features held more sway than other factors. J. Y. Kim & Cho, on the other hand, employed the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence method to measure feature relevance in prediction using latent states from an encoder-decoder model (J. Y. Kim & Cho, 2019).  Tree-based methods have been widely used in evaluating feature importance by calculating each feature's contribution to reducing impurity within the tree model. These methods include Random Forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), XGBoost, and Cubist (Moon et al., 2022b, 2022a). For example, Moon et al. showed how in a building load prediction scenario utilizing Cubist regression it is possible to rank the importance of features, revealing that external factors such as outdoor air temperature and holiday indexes, along with internal factors like one day-ahead and one week-ahead energy load, plays fundamental roles (Moon et al., 2022a).  Sipple proposed an unsupervised anomaly detection method for Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to identify power meter device failures in office buildings, employing an integrated gradients approach to interpret anomalies (Sipple, 2020). M. Wang et al. developed a similar work by utilizing ANN gradients models to quantify the marginal impact of features on predictions based on a backpropagation rule for HVAC performances evaluation, the gradients were also leveraged for feature selection (M. Wang et al., 2022).  Counterfactual explanation is yet another system for generating local interpretations of individual samples. This method creates nearby samples with minimal feature changes that alter the model's output. Sakkas et al. selected features through statistical analysis and then utilized them for Diverse Counterfactual Explanation (DiCE) model to conduct counterfactual analysis to interpretate energy demand forecasting (Sakkas et al., 2021).  The ELI5 Python package, named \"explain like I'm five,\" has been used to interpret various black-box machine learning models, including XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Keras, and Scikit-learn. Sarp et al. employed ELI5 to interpret an XGBoost model, facilitating the deployment of a machine learning-based renewable energy prediction model (Sarp et al., 2021). In their study, time and irradiance emerged as the most influential features for predicting solar power generation. In addition to global interpretations, the authors also delved into local interpretations using ELI5.   112  W. Zhang, Liu, et al. trained a rule-set surrogate model to replace the Random Forest (RF) model for building energy prediction (W. Zhang, Liu, et al., 2021). Another study of G. Li et al. employed a surrogate model to replace a multi-objective optimization algorithm for HVAC setpoint control (G. Li et al., 2021). Remarkably, the results demonstrated that straightforward decision-tree-like rule sets could achieve about 90% of the performance of detailed model predictive controllers while significantly reducing computational costs.   2.6 SmartLAB: Use case scenario and Proof of Concept (PoC) The present research outlines the design and development of a control and management system for a local microgrid located within the Faculty of Architecture at Sapienza University of Rome (Figure  23). This initiative seeks to establish an experimental demonstration environment, called the \"SmartLAB\", endowed with photovoltaic energy generation capabilities and an electric vehicle charging station, leveraging advanced artificial intelligence (AI) self-learning techniques. In this scenario, the study aims to delineate an experimental methodology to develop a Digital Twin prototype, serving as a Proof of Concept (PoC), that specializes in the management and optimization of Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) and Energy Management for buildings connected to a microgrid.  Figure  23.

This architecture is designed to manage and reduce energy consumption, enhance the utilization of spaces, and increase the knowledge of the entire real estate portfolio, ensuring air quality control in the most critical indoor environments. It involves the installation of IoT devices to measure the energy consumption of Methodology 113  equipment and integration with existing building automation systems (BACS and BMS) to achieve energy efficiency goals. This also includes monitoring thermo-hygrometric well-being, safety, and environmental quality.

This spans from its intricate atomic structures to its overarching geometric configurations. Ideally, any intelligence gleaned from a physical inspection of such an entity should be readily retrievable from its Digital Twin counterpart\u201d. Michael Grieves, 2016, Digital Twin Institute. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts a burgeoning role for artificial intelligence in the energy sector, catalyzing a transformation in global energy systems to become more interconnected, reliable, and sustainable. Economic projections suggest that by 2040, there will be an estimated one billion \u201cSmart Homes\u201d and 11 billion smart devices globally. Efficiently optimizing these through AI could lead to a more than 10% reduction in energy consumption. Integrating this with photovoltaic energy production further provides end-users and managers the tools to make more informed energy management decisions. Microgrids harvest vast amounts of data from Internet of Things (IoT) systems, particularly their sensors. This data undergoes processing and translation into actionable insights by sophisticated self-learning algorithms. Concerning renewable energy production, unpredictable weather conditions can introduce significant challenges. AI systems are well-positioned to optimize the production, transmission, and storage of energy harnessed from photovoltaic installations. The culmination of these efforts is the realization of a small-scale smart energy grid, entirely overseen by artificial intelligence through machine learning algorithms. The AI software, at a home automation level, monitors, and interprets the unique energy requirements of individual users, proactively intervening to eliminate any unnecessary consumption. AI's capabilities extend to monitoring multiple photovoltaic installations within a network, amalgamating data related to energy generation, maintenance needs, and generation efficiency. Within the realm of photovoltaic energy production system control and management, AI techniques can be delineated into three primary areas: \uf0b7 Forecasting and modeling meteorological data \uf0b7 Fundamental solar cell modeling \uf0b7 Sizing of photovoltaic installations. Consequently, through real-time AI analysis, the system can alert users of potential power plant malfunctions, anticipate energy generation, and maintain a comprehensive database for the optimal management of photovoltaic systems.  118  For instance, should solar energy reserves approach depletion, the system can automatically switch off a television, dim the lights, or even reduce a stereo's volume or a fan's intensity. Such a system, when synchronized with a building-scaled photovoltaic energy production system, can provide estimates of costs and consumption. This equips a local microgrid manager or user to make more sustainable decisions. The research endeavor is structured into three distinct implementation phases: 1. Creation of a digital information system using Building Information Modeling (BIM) methodology; design and implementation of a photovoltaic installation for electrical energy production and an electric mobility charging system; 2. Design and execution of a home automation system serving the SmartLAB to holistically manage installations and devices; 3. Development of a machine learning system that records and discerns the energy needs of the SmartLAB and vehicle charging, preemptively forecasting the actual production of the photovoltaic system. This then proactively interacts with the storage system's usage and potentially remodulates consumption. The benchmark for assessing the research's accuracy and relevance will hinge on analyzing data from consumption monitoring software reports of the realized micro-smart grid. This is juxtaposed against daily production data from the installed photovoltaic system. The AI management system's performance will be assessed using the most contemporary criteria for building and microgrid energy efficiency and management. The facility, depicted in Figure  24 and Figure  25, consists of an electrical generation system based on photovoltaic panels mounted on a flat roof. These panels, crucial components in harnessing sunlight and converting it to electricity, operate in conjunction with an inverter, a device integral to the transformation of direct current (DC) generated by the panels into alternating current (AC) suitable for domestic or commercial use.  Figure  24. Photovoltaic system powering the SmartLAB Methodology 119   Figure  25. Photovoltaic system powering the SmartLAB Connected to this energy production system are several loads, which are essentially components or sections of the facility that consume the generated power. Notable among these are: \uf0b7 Lights in the corridors adjacent to the main hall  \uf0b7 Laboratories of the Interdepartmental Center  \uf0b7 Electric vehicle (EV) charging station The establishment of the network infrastructure involves the placement of meters, as depicted in Figure  26. These meters are vital components for the real-time monitoring of various parameters like electricity consumption, generation, and load demand within the infrastructure. These measuring instruments need to be interconnected through a dedicated data network using hybrid technology. This technology combines both wired and wireless connections. Specifically: \uf0b7 Wired Connections: these connections often offer stability, high-speed data transmission, and reduced interference. In settings where real-time data is critical, such as power consumption metrics, a wired connection is often the preferred choice due to its consistent and reliable performance.  120  \uf0b7 Wireless Connection Components: while wired connections bring stability, wireless connections bring flexibility. They can be especially useful in areas that are hard to reach or where laying physical cables might be challenging or not cost-effective. Modern wireless communication technologies, such as Wi-Fi 6 or LoRaWAN, can ensure a relatively stable and secure connection over considerable distances.  Figure  26. SmartLAB\u2019s network infrastructure  The architectural layout (Figure  27) of the SmartLAB laboratory is characterized by: \uf0b7 Two Distinct Macro Environments: these zones are linked by a transitional corridor and are segregated by a translucent polycarbonate partition. \uf0b7 Functional Workspaces: each of these environments is equipped with multiple dedicated workspaces, complete with workstations and advanced computing infrastructure. These setups are integral for facilitating both routine research and specialized experimental undertakings. In the context of the case study's objective, these two macro environments will be approached as independent entities. The primary aim is to monitor environmental parameters encompassing temperature, relative humidity (RH), carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, and overall energy consumption metrics. Methodology 121   Figure  27. SmartLAB\u2019s architectural layout Building upon this foundational understanding, the present research delineated specific requirements for the Digital Twin\u2019s PoC, summarized as: \uf0b7 Data Management: real-time processing of data from IoT devices with storage in specialized databases. \uf0b7 Visualization: dynamic portrayal of data through three-dimensional models in real-time. \uf0b7 Data Analysis: employing Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques for data interpretation, predictive analytics, and disseminating insights via comprehensive dashboards. \uf0b7 Implementation: concrete strategies rooted in the assimilated data to enhance Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) and streamline energy management. These requirements were then methodically aligned with capabilities inspired by \"The Digital Twin Capabilities Periodic Table\" (CPT) for the digital model's development. Key aspects of significant relevance were discerned based on the Clusters proposed by the research consortium (refer to Figure  28).  122   Figure  28. Digital Twin Consortium Capabilities Periodic Table The design phase aimed to ascertain the alignment between physical assets and their digital counterparts as described below. a. Pinpointing use-case specific objectives Recognizing essential capabilities based on insights from the Digital Twin Consortium, 2022. Opting for pivotal technologies and demarcating requisite information types across the asset's lifespan. The architecture of the system for the SmartLAB Digital Twin encompasses: a BIM model for virtual representation; an IoT framework for real-time data capture; an interactive IoT platform bridging Physical and Digital Twins; a database for data storage; and a system dedicated to data visualization and analytics. b. Tool Selection & Benchmarking There's a research deficit regarding effective Digital Twin creation tools. Both proprietary and open-source solutions were evaluated. Given the integration gap between BIM and IoT, an IoT platform synergized with a BIM-integrative application was explored. The choice was the open-source Node-Red-based platform, favored for its user-friendliness and comprehensive toolset that facilitates remote IoT device monitoring, data storage, rule-setting for action triggers, and data analytics. c. Proof-of-Concept Creation The preliminary phase involved configuring the platform using simulated sensors, replicating real ones. These sensors periodically relayed predefined values, either generated through Python scripts for realistic scenarios or manually for edge cases. IoT device interaction rules were formulated, and their efficacy was validated using simulated data. Methodology 123  d. Synchronizing Physical and Digital Twins Post-validation with simulated sensors, the physical IoT devices were integrated into the SmartLAB. Ensuring high-quality data from sensors was pivotal. With collaboration from manufacturer technicians, device models and optimal positioning were determined. Subsequently, connections were established between IoT devices and the data platform, with real-time data driving the rule configurations. e. Historical Data Accumulation Sensor data is archived in a PostgreSQL database, accessible for advanced analytics via Machine Learning. Once adequate data is amassed, it forms the foundation for training Machine Learning models. f. Machine Learning Integration With centralized data storage, advanced analytical models can be crafted. These models are adept at emulating and optimizing the primary parameters of the sophisticated energy grid. Utilizing location-focused machine learning techniques and rules, active devices can be discerned. AI techniques transform power consumption patterns into \"energy device words\", and a \"Na\u00efve Bayes classifier\" discerns each energy load's category, highlighting discrepancies between digital and real-world representations. g. Data Visualization and Analysis Within the IoT platform, data is exhibited on user-centric dashboards. Real-time information is juxtaposed against reference benchmarks for intuitive comprehension. Time-series graphs facilitate historical data comparison across sensors. h. Augmentation Phase Given a Digital Twin's inherent requirement for scalability and expandability, the SmartLAB solution was conceived with adaptability in mind. Leveraging open-source software ensures seamless future tool integrations, augmenting the Digital Twin's prowess. Post-validation, this model's functionalities will extend to encompass the entire building, a testament to the platform's scalability accommodating multitudes of IoT devices. In the contemporary landscape of digital twin technology, there's a diverse spectrum of offerings. The market currently leans towards two primary segments: 1. Holistic Commercial Solutions: these are all-encompassing platforms offering end-to-end solutions for digital twin creation, management, and analysis.  124  2. Modular Solutions: this approach allows the combination of multiple applications, each catering to specific functions, thereby piecing together a more bespoke digital twin solution. Within this modular framework, both commercial and open-source solutions find representation. For the scope of the study, a hybrid methodology was carried out, emphasizing especially on leveraging the strengths of open-source platforms. The following diagram is related to the architecture of the DT system which is divided into various components and layers that work together to create a digital counterpart of a physical asset, allowing for simulation, monitoring, and management through the use of technologies such as IoT (Internet of Things), BIM (Building Information Modeling), and databases (Figure 29).              The main components are: 1. Virtual Representation: It includes the BIM model, the integration of engineering systems, and simulated sensors for synthetic data generation. 2. Physical Asset: Concerns IoT sensors and actuators, data streaming, and IoT system integration. 3. Data Acquisition & Ingestion: This step is responsible for the acquisition and ingestion of data from the physical level to the virtual one. Figure Figure  29. Proposed conceptual architecture for the CITERA SmartLAB Methodology 125  4. Data Management: Uses a PostgreSQL database for real-time processing, data aggregation, temporal data storage, and event logging. 5. User Interface: Comprises various modules such as the asset manager, BIM viewer, rules for command and control, insights for data analysis, and dashboards. 6. Authentication System: Deals with the security of devices and the system as a whole. 7. Actuation Layer: This is the output layer that allows the system to act on the physical world, likely through commands sent to actuators. The flow of data primarily occurs from the physical asset to the virtual representation and back, enabling continuous monitoring and control of the physical asset via its digital twin. This type of architecture is typically used for the management of buildings, industrial plants, and other infrastructures to optimize operations, maintenance, and planning.  2.6.3 Data acquisition and transmission Automated production operations can be networked together thanks to real-time data-driven technologies, producing direct communication and coordination systems and resulting in highly autonomous processes. Then the Digital Twin paradigm defines a model where computer-driven systems monitor physical processes, configuring a virtual copy of the physical world and obtaining decentralized decisions based on self-organization mechanisms (Smit, 2016) The collaboration between 3D information models and IoT devices is highly necessary for a successful implementation of real-time DT purposes as well as for developing energy management optimizations. As such, the BIM Model containing data and information useful to the process assessments becomes able to communicate with the real system using data from sensors, developing learning capabilities able to process the received information. The implementation of IoT in the real-world environments in a smart, ubiquitous and live-interconnected way is still partially restricted by barriers like device battery life, network capacity and the cost of maintaining both. The core functionality of IoT devices in DT configurations for energy and IAQ management is to reliably collect and share data (such as flow rates, temperatures, pressures, physical movements, distance, mass etc.) from its designated environment to the virtual world. The hardware element consists of a battery-powered sensor, an actuator and a communication system. The collected data is then processed on the device and consequently sent to remote servers through the communication network.   126  In the present methodology, the connection between the physical and virtual model is made through sensors (Raval, 2021) able to monitor and communicate electrical power data such as Power Energy Voltmeter Ammeter for lighting and HVAC systems, and Smart Plugs for electromotive equipment such as computers, televisions, washing machines and so forth (Karami et al., 2018). AI systems then allow the DT to develop predictive capabilities, learning from the events and improving the outputs, ultimately taking and implementing autonomous decisions based on the analysis carried out without human interventions.  Then the AI system achieves a balance between energy consumption and performance parameters (Corry et al., 2015) of energy production system, adapting himself to the environment in order to achieve the predefined objectives. In other words, the system takes data from sensing devices and uses a reasoning system to generate appropriate and specific actions, modifying the behavior of the equipment in order to optimize the energy consumption.   Figure  30. DT comprehensive conceptualization The precision-driven design of modern architectural environments requires a consistent approach, especially in integrating sensor-based monitoring systems. These sensors and their peripherals are crucial for real-time feedback, enabling users to fine-tune environmental conditions for optimal performance and safety (Figure  30). To achieve comprehensive monitoring of the stated environment, an array of strategically placed sensors has been deployed. These sensors are tasked with tracking various environmental parameters. Furthermore, the associated Methodology 127  peripherals are designed not only to receive this data but also to execute specific, targeted interventions based on the received input.  2.6.4 IoT sensors network In detail, the sensor suite comprises the following devices: Shelly SmartPlug S: a smart plug device that can remotely control and monitor the power consumption of connected electrical devices. Shelly Motion Sensor: a device adept at detecting motion within its field of view, crucial for understanding the occupancy and movement patterns in the space. Shelly Relay 2.5: a versatile actuator that allows for the remote toggling of devices, making it instrumental in dynamic environmental adjustments. Shelly Door/Window: this sensor provides insights into the opening or closure status of doors and windows, thus playing a crucial role in safety and energy conservation. Kolb Burmeister CO2 Ampel: a CO2 measurement device, ensuring that the indoor air quality ensuring safe and comfortable levels for the occupants. A notable feature of the Shelly devices is their compatibility with the MQTT protocol (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport). This lightweight, publish/subscribe network protocol is specifically tailored for devices operating over potentially unstable networks, making it ideal for IoT applications. Furthermore, these peripherals come with an in-built web server, functioning as MQTT brokers. This design facet ensures that the devices are self-reliant, negating the need for external servers, and can directly connect to the network, rendering them instantly operational. Complementing this setup are the XIAOMI sensors within the laboratory. These devices communicate through the proprietary MIoT-Spec protocol. They interact with dedicated gateways and use the ZIGBEE wireless standard for intra-laboratory communication. Lastly, the Schneider Electric PowerTags have been integrated into the system. Installed within the control panel, these devices liaise through the ModBus protocol, a time-tested serial communication protocol conceptualized in 1979 for interfacing programmable logic controllers. An intricate web of sensors, actuators, and communication protocols culminates in a responsive, adaptive, and efficient environment, reflecting the zenith of modern architectural practices described as follows (Figure  31).  128    Figure  31. Indoor IoT devices and Communication protocols  Outdoor devices are shown in Figure  32 and include sensors for photovoltaic production, consumption associated with electric vehicle charging, and the weather station.   Figure  32. Outdoor IoT devices and Communication protocols  Since most sensors monitor multiple parameters simultaneously, the list of quantities monitored by the different sensors is detailed in Figure  33 and Figure  34. Methodology 129   Figure  33. Quantities monitored by the different sensors                    Figure  34. SmartLAB's layout and sensors\u2019 location  130  Electricity Consumption Sensors The number of smart-plug electricity consumption sensors is determined by the need to monitor the consumption of individual users within the CITERA environments individually and to correlate the data with the presence data from cameras to simulate consumption profiles. The sensors can monitor the instantaneous power required by the user (W), the overall electrical consumption (kWh) by integrating power over time (min), and potentially turn on and off downstream devices to reduce consumption due to the presence of hardware in standby or service utilities (coffee machines, fixed lamps, etc.). The presence of power-meters at the panel allows for the monitoring of overall consumption (kWh) and the required power (W), taking into account and separating data from the lighting system, air conditioning, outlets not covered by smart-plugs, and energy losses due to transportation. Furthermore, both the photovoltaic system and the electric car charging station are monitored. However, these elements are currently not active within the structure of the Valle Giulia faculty due to delays in the authorization process. The number of channels provided in the power-meters is proportional to the number of environments and the main expected loads. Specifically, the following are monitored through the different channels of the power-meters: \uf0b7 CITERA's air conditioning system. \uf0b7 CITERA's motive power system. \uf0b7 CITERA's lighting system. \uf0b7 Photovoltaic system. \uf0b7 Electric charging station. Monitoring of electrical utilities occurs via smart plugs for the analysis of instantaneous and average power (W), status (on-off), and usage time (min); it is possible to monitor the general electrical consumption of utilities, lighting system, air conditioning, electric column, and photovoltaic system from the panel via dedicated power-meters, as well as the analysis of average and instantaneous power (W), and time (min). Presence Sensors Occupancy monitoring is ensured by the presence of occupancy sensors and cameras capable of working with computer vision algorithms. Monitoring of all environments is carried out using presence sensors, delegating the counting of people to cameras only for environments where crowding of several people at the same time is expected. IAQ Sensors The assessment of air quality (IAQ) and thermal comfort is carried out through the integration of data available from a series of sensors. In particular, IAQ is Methodology 131  guaranteed by the presence of sensors capable of analyzing the level of concentration of tVOC, PM2.5, PM10, and CO2 in terms of ppm simultaneously. Thus, air quality sensors are expected to be one per room. Considering the air recirculation in different environments due to thermal loads, it is not necessary to plan for more, since small variations in the values within the environments are not significant for monitoring IAQ and thermal comfort (the full scale and error of these sensors are normally lower than the concentration variations naturally present in the environments). The sensors are able to provide air quality assessments also through aggregated metrics (IAQ indices) and algorithms for compliance with the relevant ISO standards will be implemented on the SW side. Thermal Comfort Sensors In order to evaluate the temperature, sensors capable of recording the temperature in degrees (\u00b0C) and ambient humidity in terms of relative humidity (RH) are inserted in each environment. This information is obtained from presence sensors (temperature), IAQ sensors (temperature and humidity), and sensors for the closing of openings (temperature). The data will be taken both punctually and aggregated through Machine Learning logic in order to obtain a general data capable of describing each environment also at a predictive level and performing PVM and PPD calculations as described by UNI EN ISO 7730:2006. Lighting Sensors The overall assessment of internal lighting is carried out through the use of Luxmeters (Lux) installed inside presence sensors, IAQ sensor, and magnetic sensors for doors/windows. As for the assessment of thermal comfort, the data will be both aggregated and averaged to create a comprehensive and punctual measure based on the information collected in the environment. Furthermore, in the future, the data thus obtained may be used for the evaluation of lighting comfort at the level of work surfaces (Standard UNI EN 12464-1) and for the dimming of the fixtures (currently not supported by the lighting system). Actuators Smart Plugs, the automatic opening system of the openings, and the relays represent the main actuators inserted within the case study. The actuation of the devices must be carefully evaluated, as turning off the lighting systems represents a risk for safety, turning off the electrical outlets can cause data loss from computer devices, damage the connected devices, or interrupt ongoing experiments. The expected number is sufficient to ensure the monitoring of electrical loads and remote control of the individual workstations to which they are connected. The relays are instead inserted internally to the electrical panel for monitoring the loads and control (on/off) of the lights inside CITERA and  132  in the box for controlling the servomotor in charge of opening and closing the window. Each of the actuators is able to record general absorption in W, the system status, and the usage time. These data allow through their historicization the use in Machine Learning logics for the development of usage models and the creation of future predictions. Finally, among the actuators, the role of maintainers and users is integrated, who through a Human-in-the-loop logic, can perform the actions recommended by the system where the installation of automatic actuators is not foreseen or not possible.

MQTT, on the other hand, is a messaging protocol designed for Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The use of the MQTT protocol requires a specific Broker service that is performed separately through service within server nodes or concentrators. Where possible, the use of HTTP is preferred in order to reduce the number of active software services on the server. Modbus is a communication protocol used for transmitting information over serial lines between electronic devices to an industrial standard. ONVIF is a standard dedicated to managing video streams from IP cameras and is preferable to data access via FTP as it allows for the request of individual frames directly from the device and low latency. REST manages data calls over HTTP through APIs that are used for communication with local or external servers to access available data. Another preferential element is the ability to request data traffic on demand from the management platform in order to reduce network traffic, decide the update frequency for each device, and ensure system stability. During the infrastructure design, an effort was made to standardize the type of data protocols used as much as possible, preferring hardware from the same manufacturer (where possible) and equipped with open communication libraries already integrated into the main existing Digital Twin platforms. For example, Shelly peripherals are internally equipped with a web server to allow direct network access without the need for configuration of a dedicated MQTT Broker service; such peripherals can thus send traffic related to measured data through a standard connection. The ModBus protocol is used for the connection of Schneider power-meters, which devices are wired and physically integrated into the network via Ethernet cable. The weather station operates via REST APIs through the Davis service of the manufacturer. Finally, the cameras work through ONVIF. Each peripheral is assigned a static IP during registration to the network segment; these IPs are used to connect the specific peripheral with the management platform and ensure continuity in case of system restart. The internal management of the Schneider power-meters, which uses an internal radio protocol for wireless communication between the amperometric clamps and the data reading device (power-meter), is an exception to the previously stated. The system is configurable via the proprietary ECOStruxure software. In the case of integrating additional devices that use MQTT and are not equipped with an internal web server, Mosquitto Broker, an open-source message Methodology 137  broker that implements the said protocol and is widely used for managing lightweight messaging in various communication scenarios, will be employed.  2.6.5 Advanced system architecture  The construction of the system's architecture was founded on a comprehensive assessment of the capabilities and tailored solutions employed for the use case. This is visualized in a general schema in Figure  35.  Figure  35. Key components and system architecture  Local System Configuration and Data Management: A decision was made to deploy a localized system built upon a robust platform. This platform receives data inputs, processes it using a feed-forward mechanism, and subsequently disseminates this data. This processed data finds utility in three primary domains: \uf0b7 Implementation \uf0b7 Visualization \uf0b7 Archival for predictive analytics Network Configuration: The peripheral devices are linked to an exclusive WLAN to ensure their autonomy from the primary laboratory network. The dedicated network utilizes EDGE technology for data reception and processing. This design employs data publication to segregate the peripherals from logical flows. This strategic insertion guarantees peripheral shielding, safeguarding against unauthorized or aberrant activities. Notably, the IoT devices in the SmartLAB connect to the Digital Twin platform through a specialized Wi-Fi network, with certain exceptions like Schneider Acti9 PowerTag Links and the Fronius inverter, which employ a wired connection.  138  At the heart of this architecture are the following components: Edge System: interacts with the local sensor network, buffering data, and managing automated behaviors. It uses a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with the Raspbian operating system. Various software components, both basic and application-specific, are deployed. Notably, Real T s.r.l.'s Elettra system manages sensor data. Proxy: this intermediates the Edge and Server, ensuring uninterrupted data synchronization. For this, a standard PC with a Debian Linux distribution is employed, utilizing the Zabbix open-source software for data relay to the central system. Server: handles computation and provides a GUI. A robust server, situated outside the SmartLAB, was chosen, running on the Debian Linux distribution. This server interfaces with the Zabbix Server, manages connections to specific IoT devices, and houses the machine learning system for energy optimization. Energy Management System (EMS): in the context of EMS, IoT devices liaise with a local data concentrator (edge device), which further interfaces with a central data recording and processing unit. Due to the system's scale in this study, there's only one data concentrator and integration point with the sensor network, as depicted in Figure  36.  Figure  36. IoT devices and local data concentrator (edge device) for Energy Management System (EMS)  Centralized Processing and Analytics: The logical structure of the system is consolidated in Figure 29 and 30. The Central Control System on the server employs Artificial Intelligence to analyze collected data. Its objective is to craft algorithms that enhance energy efficiency without compromising comfort.  Methodology 139   Infrastructure Design and Implementation:  According to the network configuration described above, the core elements of this architecture are three: \u25cf Edge: it is responsible for interacting with the local sensor network and acting as a buffer for automatic data and behaviors; \u25cf Proxy: it enables the interface between Edge and Server, ensuring connection and synchronization of data and commands (and recovery after any momentary lack of connectivity); \u25cf Server: it is responsible for all computation and provides a graphical user interface (GUI). Edge computer: a classic SoC (System on Chip) often used in research has been chosen, the Raspberry system, specifically Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. The operating system is the Raspbian (a version of the Debian Linux distribution adapted to Raspberry hardware). A set of software, both basic and application-specific software, has been installed on this device. The basic software components are necessary for managing both wired and wireless communications with the sensor networks and the Proxy system. The communication chosen was via IP protocol and where possible via TCP/IP, as far as sensor networks are concerned, and certainly TCP/IP as far as communication with the Proxy is concerned. In this installation, being an experimental installation, a remote monitoring VPN (Virtual Private Network) was also installed: under normal use this is not expected to be a VPN installation in the Edge system. In terms of application-specific software, the sensor management component of Real T s.r.l.'s Elettra system has been installed. This component has the responsibility of the retrieval of consumption information using several communication protocols used by hardware vendors (e.g., Shelly, Schneider, Fronius) and the production of standardised data in the form [timestamp, device_identifier, measurement].  The Elettra subsystem is responsible for dialogue with assorted sensors and therefore must implement the communication protocols typical of each vendor; it is therefore appropriate for it to be in close proximity to the sensors themselves to minimize transmission problems and to monitor sensor networks even in the absence of connectivity to the central system.  For this reason, it has been installed on the Edge system. Proxy: a standard Personal Computer with a Linux system Debian distribution has been used for this purpose.   140  The Proxy subsystem has the responsibility of normalizing the data and transmitting it, when connectivity is available, to the central system from which it can then receive commands for turn-on or turn-off devices. A set of software has been installed on this device.  The communication software components use TCP/IP protocol through a dedicated VPN (Virtual Private Network) to guarantee the connection with the server located in a datacenter outside the SmartLAB facility.  As for the application-specific software, the Proxy component of the open-source software Zabbix has been installed: this software has the single responsibility of data transfer to the central system. Appropriate scripts have been created to enable the communication between the Zabbix Proxy and the Elettra subsystem; specifically, they allow to query the Elettra system and to properly format the data for the Zabbix Server. In the SmartLAB use case this solution might rightfully seem redundant; however, the architecture is designed to be scalable: the typical configuration should be one Edge system per apartment (or office) and one Proxy per building (about 20-30 apartments). In that case it is appropriate to have the Proxy responsible for proximity dialogue with the Edge systems and each Edge system responsible for dialogue with its own sensor network. Server: a server with appropriate computational resources has been chosen in a datacentre outside the SmartLAB. The operating system Linux distribution Debian has been installed on it. As in the proxy system a set of software, described hereafter, has been installed on the server. The basic software components are in charge of communications with the proxy system and are mainly related to the VPN (Virtual Private Network) with the proxy located at CITERA and to the web and application server necessary for the user interface. The Zabbix Server ensures communication with the edge device running the Zabbix Proxy. The central IoT platform is responsible for connections to IoT devices that don\u2019t require management using Elettra, for storing data and sending commands for turn-on or turn-off devices. The server also hosts the Machine Learning system that performs all calculations related to energy management optimization. Methodology 141  The logical architecture of the system is described in Figure 37, the software stack installed on the server is defined Central Control System. The infrastructure was realized in two stages: 1. Infrastructure design and implementation 2. Data acquisition, model training, and validation Considering energy data as time series recordings from sensors, each with its API, there's a need for a synchronous and unified dataset. Each workstation is equipped with sensors to monitor individual equipment, aiding in devising energy-efficient control solutions. The challenge was to centralize this data processing, necessitating a local system responsible for sensor and actuator interconnections over networks like the Internet. Two primary challenges were addressed: ensuring uniform data and having data processed at requisite locations. This led to the design of two subsystems: \u201celettra\u201d and \u201cproxy\u201d, as shown in Figure  38.   Figure  38. Design and implementation of the infrastructure  Figure 37. Logical Architecture of the System  142  As energy data are simple time series of power consumption or production, in a given time lapse coming from real sensors, each one transmits data with its own Application Programming Interface (API); moreover, they are located close to energy loads, or near power sources. This means that data are not all in the same place at the same time, which is a necessary condition to start the analysis which will led to the desired algorithms. The first nontrivial problem is therefore to plan and deploy a cost-effective IT infrastructure able to provide reliable data for the software to analyse. Each single workplace has been implemented with sensors monitoring every single equipment, so that the energy consumption of every device can be considered to model the control solution for the overall energy requirement of each workplace. All those metering sensor produce a huge amount of data requiring significative computational resources to obtain acceptable analysis performances, so the best solution for reducing installation expenses would be to control the system acquiring all the information in a data center or a service in a data center. This architecture leads to the necessity of setting a local system, each with responsibility for interconnecting sensors and actuators over a geographical network (e.g., the Internet), executing sort of local computation and buffering data in case of connection blackout, using the known \u201cUbiquitous and Pervasive computing\u201d (Tomazzoli et al., 2023a) techniques to deal with the computational problems of centralized intelligence. So, as mentioned, the first element in the infrastructure will be a sub-system, able to cope with several transmission protocols and several time frames, whose output will be the synchronized power consumption (or production) of the devices smart metered. This sub-system can accept instruction from the second element to switch on and off some of the controlled devices.  This element needs to dialogue with all sensor networks, so it has to be physically placed next to them, to minimize transmission problems and monitoring local environment even in absence of communication with the central control system. This kind of elements in the following will be called \u201celettra\u201d. The second architecture element will be another sub-system, composed of different \u201cproxy\u201d, and each proxy receive as input the outputs of the first sub-system. The proxies will deliver the data to the central unit, and receive back commands from the same device, taking care of bandwidth problems and unreliability of the network.  These proxies have to be physically close to the first sub-system while the central unit can be remote; the central control system, a centralized unit able to store Methodology 143  and process data, operate building digital simulation models and delivers commands back to the proxies. Following this logic infrastructure, a series of \u201ccheap\u201d small computer, or SoC (System on Chip) has to be equipped, containing both the \u201celettra\u201d and \u201cproxy\u201d sub-systems; all those computers are connected to a high-performing server in a data center able to run the software of the central control system. The operative concept of this infrastructure is exemplified in Figure  39, where are sketched only a few energy consumer devices as an example.  In Figure  39 elements e1, e2, e3, e4, e5 are the cheap computing unequip containing the elettra sub-system and the proxy, while elements c1 to c10 are energy load examples, and production system is related to photovoltaic panels for electric power production.  2.6.6 Multi-service approach Utilizing a composite methodology provides the advantage of exploring a diverse range of software solutions, each tailored with its unique attributes that address specific challenges and requirements. By analyzing software solutions through a comparative lens, one can discern the inherent strengths and limitations associated with each. Embracing an open-source philosophy for the process not only underscores transparency and community-driven development but also distinguishes this approach markedly from proprietary commercial solutions.  Open-source platforms typically foster a more collaborative environment, encouraging shared knowledge, rapid iteration, and the ability to customize applications to suit unique needs. Figure  39. Operative concept  144  In our quest to meet the outlined objectives and harness the capabilities desired, three distinct platforms were identified: \uf0b7 Node-Red: an event-driven programming tool that facilitates visual coding for wiring together devices, APIs, and online services. Its flow-based development environment is specifically designed to assist with the integration of disparate systems. \uf0b7 Godot: a multifaceted, open-source game engine that supports both 2D and 3D game creation. Beyond gaming, Godot's powerful scripting and visualization capabilities make it a viable tool for various interactive projects and simulations. \uf0b7 KNIME: an open analytics platform that offers advanced data integration, transformation, and exploration capabilities. With its rich set of nodes for data processing and visualization, KNIME provides a flexible environment for data-driven tasks and analytics. Although each platform excels in its domain, the true potential is realized when they operate in unison. By facilitating seamless interoperability and data exchange among these platforms, a cohesive workflow that maintains both the continuity and the integrity of the overarching process was ensured, as visualized in Figure  40's comprehensive diagram. This synergy underscores the potency of an integrated multi-platform approach in addressing complex challenges as described below.  Figure  40. Interoperability and data exchange  Data Collection \uf0b7 IoT: Internet of Things devices, which can range from smart appliances to industrial machines, collecting data from the environment. \uf0b7 EDGE: the edge computing component where the data from sensors and IoT devices is processed. It likely preprocesses this data before it's sent to the main system for further processing.  Methodology 145  Data Processing and Visualization \uf0b7 Raspbian: This is a free operating system based on Debian, optimized for the Raspberry Pi hardware. It hosts the applications mentioned in the diagram. \uf0b7 Node Red: A flow-based development tool for visual programming, mainly used for wiring together hardware devices, APIs, and online services. \uf0b7 SQLite Local: A local lightweight database used to store raw data. \uf0b7 Internal Event Driven Logic: Processes raw data based on specific events or conditions. \uf0b7 KNIME: An open-source data analytics platform. It seems to be used here for: \uf0b7 Data Mining: Extracting patterns from large data sets. \uf0b7 Historical Data & Prediction: using past data to forecast future events or trends. \uf0b7 KNIME/Power BI Data Visualization: Power BI is a business analytics tool by Microsoft. Together with KNIME, it's used for visual representation of the data. Data Output and Integration \uf0b7 Actuation: Represents actions or changes triggered based on the processed data. \uf0b7 Node Red Dashboard: A dashboard that displays data and perhaps allows user interaction. \uf0b7 Email: Notification or data sending mechanism. Graphics and Application Development \uf0b7 Godot 3.5: A game engine used for developing multiplatform games and applications. \uf0b7 IFC, ARC Input Blender: Input formats for 3D modeling, likely used to create graphics or representations of the data. \uf0b7 GLTF - 3D Open Format: A format for 3D scenes and models. It's a common format for three-dimensional graphics data. \uf0b7 Multiplatform App: The main application developed using Godot, which can run on multiple platforms. \uf0b7 HTML5 Windows Executable: A web-based application or frontend. The architecture provides an end-to-end flow starting from raw data collection to processing, analysis, visualization, and finally to actuation. It incorporates both data science elements (like prediction and data mining) and application development components (like the multiplatform app).   146  2.6.6.1 Node-Red In the expansive realm of applications tailored for managing data from peripheral devices, the Node-Red platform stands out and was consequently chosen to orchestrate a workflow adept at bi-directionally managing the IoT peripherals within the laboratory setting. Node-Red is ingeniously built atop Node.js, an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. This foundational choice ensures scalability, flexibility, and a strong compatibility across diverse hardware and software ecosystems. One of the pivotal strengths of Node-Red is its emphasis on a No-code or Low-code paradigm, primarily executed via nodes. This design philosophy paves the way for users to intuitively harness the platform's capabilities, eliminating the often-daunting necessity to craft original code from scratch. These nodes, which encapsulate specific functionalities, are predominantly authored in the ubiquitous JavaScript language. Given the vast and vibrant community behind Node-Red, there's a continual influx of novel nodes, each addressing unique challenges or streamlining existing processes. When these nodes are strategically sequenced, they culminate in automated workflows that can perpetually operate, ensuring uninterrupted data management and processing. This systematic approach has been instrumental in the laboratory, especially for the nuanced management of sensors and actuators, as depicted in Figure  41. The figure elucidates the strategic interplay of various nodes, each contributing to the seamless operation of the entire system.   Figure  41. Sensors network implementation  Node-Red offers an array of functionalities that facilitate multifaceted interactions. Some notable features encompass: Methodology 147  \uf0b7 Data Retrieval: Capability to source data from external devices, ensuring a continuous flow of real-time information. \uf0b7 Custom Processing: Leverage custom functions to process and transform incoming data to meet specific requirements. \uf0b7 Active Output Production: Generate outputs that can dynamically modify the states of interlinked machinery and peripherals, ensuring real-time response and adaptability. \uf0b7 Data Visualization: Feature-rich integrated dashboards that allow intuitive visualization and monitoring of the system's operations. \uf0b7 Image Recognition with Computer Vision: Integration with robust frameworks like TensorFlow and implementation of models like YOLO facilitates precise image recognition tasks. The hands-on experimentation conducted in the laboratory involved interfacing peripherals from diverse manufacturers such as SHELLY and KOLB BURMEISTER via the MQTT protocol. This flexible approach also postulated the potential for connecting peripherals that employ proprietary protocols or ones divergent from MQTT. A noteworthy application revolves around environmental sensors that monitor CO2 concentration. These sensors are adept not only at gauging the primary CO2 levels but also provide supplementary data like ambient temperature, relative humidity, and illuminance (Lux) measurements. In a practical scenario implemented within the laboratory, data from CO2 sensors undergoes a comparative analysis with real-time occupancy data. If the ambient CO2 concentration surpasses a predefined threshold (measured in parts per million or ppm), an automated process is triggered. This initiates the actuation of a servo motor to open a window, facilitating air circulation and renewal. The system is programmed to conclude this ventilation phase after a 15-minute duration. Post this, a magnetic sensor verifies the window's closure status, ensuring environmental safety and energy conservation. Furthermore, the lab's setup incorporated Smart Plugs and relays that could be remotely actuated by the platform to perform specific tasks associated with them. Unique nodes, tailored for each peripheral, were designed to enable seamless bidirectional communication through the platform, adapting to the requisite protocols. This intricate yet efficient arrangement is visually represented in Figure  42, illustrating the synergy among various components.  148   Figure  42. Sensor\u2019s network and communication protocols Node-Red, with its versatile and modular architecture, establishes a systematic flow of data through nodes. Here's a more scientific elucidation of the platform's operation: Initialization through the INJECT Node: The workflow commences via the INJECT node, which periodically triggers the process based on predefined intervals. The signal thus initiated is designated as \"Payload\", a packet of data that traverses through subsequent nodes in the workflow. Payload Transformation: as the Payload progresses, its constitution can be altered based on the interactions and operations specified. Figure  43 exemplifies a Payload associated with interconnected sensors. Possible transformations include data enrichment\u2014where data is augmented, revised, or aggregated to align with specific requirements. Methodology 149   Figure  43. Payload associated with interconnected sensors  Visualization through Custom Dashboards: the processed data is funneled through nodes to intuitive dashboards. These dashboards, exemplified in Figure  44, are tailored within the platform using pre-compiled themes, providing stakeholders with a consolidated view of the system's status and insights.   Figure  44. Data dashboard   150   Figure  45. Export to RDBMS & SQLite Integration  Export to RDBMS & SQLite Integration: data is not merely visualized but is also persisted in a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) configured as per the SQLite standard. SQLite, an embedded database library written in C, is renowned for its lightweight characteristics. It champions a serverless architecture, allowing the database to reside on the executing machine, facilitating in-place updates. Figure  45 outlines the structured database with its triad of tables, each tailored to accommodate data from distinct sensor types. Versatile Data Export Options: beyond relational databases, Node-Red offers flexibility in data export formats. Data can be exported in structured formats like JSON, CSV, XML, and YAML, or semi-structured formats like HTML, ensuring compatibility with diverse downstream applications and systems. Figure  46 illustrate the gamut of data export modalities available on the platform.    Figure  46. Data export modalities Integration with Game Engine: to ensure a more immersive experience, real-time IoT data was rendered accessible in textual formats (.txt) for visualization within a three-dimensional model inside a Game Engine. However, this solution Methodology 151  is slated for an upgrade. The future roadmap envisions leveraging dedicated WebSockets for broadcasting data, streamlining their integration and consumption in various applications.  2.6.6.2 Godot Game Engine The intricate world of game development hinges on powerful game engines, and in this context, the chosen game engine emerges as a robust yet lightweight solution, offering a plethora of features. Here's an enriched elucidation of the described integration process, enhanced with scientific and technical detail. The game engine under discussion is a potent, cross-platform engine designed for the creation of both 2D and 3D games. A hallmark of this engine is its impressively light footprint. Released under the MIT license, the engine is remarkable for its platform-agnostic export capabilities, with native support spanning platforms such as HTML5, Android, Windows, Mac, and more. Transition from IFC to glTF: A critical aspect of the model integration was the conversion from the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format, an open data model in the architecture and construction sector, to a format amenable to the game engine. Out of the multiple formats like FBX, OBJ, and 3ds, the Graphics Library Transmission Format (glTF) was singled out. Developed by the Khronos Group, glTF stands out as an open standard, purpose-built for the seamless transmission of 3D assets, especially in web environments. Blender & Blender BIM for Conversion: The conversion endeavor was facilitated by Blender, a renowned open-source 3D computer graphics software toolset. To specifically cater to IFC files, the Blender BIM plugin was employed, an open-source extension enhancing IFC capabilities within Blender. Post-conversion, the resultant file was funneled into the project's resource directory, triggering an automatic import into the game engine. Model Visualization & GUI Development: The model's visualization was anchored on the laboratory floor, leaning towards a more abstract rendition of the integrated geometries. Post-import, essential project elements were discerned and classified into distinct categories, accessible and filterable via a Graphic User Interface (GUI). This delineation encompassed machinery, CO2 metrics, and occupancy data (Refer Figure  47 for a snapshot of the operational GUI). Data Visualization via Particle Systems: To translate data into visual form within the model, a novel approach was employed. The various data outputs were tethered to particle systems, which excel at dynamically rendering geometric content based on data input. In this ecosystem, real-time data from the Node Red platform steers the behavior of these particle systems. Custom  152  scripts, crafted in the GDScript language, process this data to manifest a dynamic visualization reflecting the laboratory's real-world parameters.  Figure  47. Operational GUI The developed work was then exported in two different formats, the first in an executable format for a Windows environment as a stand-alone application and the second in HTML5 format for integration into web pages. The export in HTML5 format was then inserted into the general Node Red dashboard in order to create a single webpage for the reception of data and their consultation. This development process resulted in dual export formats, reflecting a broad vision to make the work both standalone and web interactive.  Exportation Flexibility: in today's dynamic software landscape, adaptability is crucial. Reflecting this, the project was tailored to be versatile in its exportation capabilities. The game engine's robustness played a pivotal role in facilitating this flexibility. The first export format is a standalone executable tailored for the Windows operating system. This format is beneficial for users who prefer a dedicated application, ensuring seamless performance without reliance on internet browsers or connectivity. It offers an encapsulated environment, streamlining the user experience by eliminating potential browser-based constraints or compatibility issues. HTML5 Format for Web Integration: in stark contrast to the standalone format, the second export, in HTML5, emphasizes accessibility and universal reach. HTML5, a modern web standard, is recognized for its multimedia capabilities and cross-platform nature. It's especially suited for rendering 2D and 3D graphics within web browsers without necessitating additional plugins. The choice of HTML5 ensures that users, irrespective of their device or operating system, can access and interact with the model seamlessly via a web interface. Unified Dashboard Integration: to elevate the user experience, the HTML5 export was seamlessly integrated into the overarching Node Red dashboard. This Methodology 153  strategic integration meant that users could access a unified web portal, amalgamating real-time data visualization with the 3D model. This singular webpage serves as a nexus for data reception and consultation, offering users a holistic view of the data interplay within the 3D environment (Figure  48).  Figure  48. Web view of the dashboard integrated with the model updated in real-time  2.6.6.3 Knime KNIME, standing for Konstanz Information Miner, is a hallmark in the realm of open-source data analytics, reporting, and integration platform. Emerging from the academic corridors of the University of Konstanz, KNIME offers an interactive platform that allows users to visually create data workflows (often  154  referred to as \"nodes\"), allowing for an intuitive process of data analytics and modeling. With its evolution into version 5, KNIME has continuously enhanced its capabilities, refined its tools, and expanded its node library. This evolution signifies its persistent commitment to address the escalating complexities of the data world. At the heart of KNIME lies its intricate node management system. This offers the advantage of segmenting various data processes, be it extraction, transformation, or modeling. Moreover, its prowess to handle voluminous data sets paves the way for comprehensive data analytics, catering to diverse objectives. The synergy between Node-Red and KNIME is evident when data exported from the former, specifically in the SQLite database format (.db), is ingested into KNIME seamlessly. The platform possesses dedicated nodes that facilitate the connection to specific format databases, as illustrated in Figure  49.   Figure  49. KNIME\u2019s nodes connection Once the data is ingested, the platform transitions into its cleaning and preprocessing phase. Leveraging its diverse nodes, specific tables can be cherry-picked from the database, ensuring the data aligns with the requirements of the subsequent analytic processes. Post-processing, visualization capabilities come into play. Data is orchestrated into dedicated dashboards, offering a visual narrative of the analytics. This not only enhances data interpretability but also aids in strategic decision-making. The true potential of data lies not just in understanding the present, but in predicting the future. With this vision, once the data is archived annually, the platform plans to delve into advanced ML (Machine Learning) and deep learning algorithms.  The objectives achieved by the experimentation have led to the creation within the Node-Red platform of a series of logical flows capable of communicating bidirectionally with the peripherals; the data exchange thus defined is archived in a SQLite database for processing in Knime and display in the Game Engine. Methodology 155  The connection was achieved for the IoT components through the use of dedicated nodes, it was possible to control their operation and design an on and off scheme linked to logics internal and external to the system. The real-time data is transmitted locally to the application developed by the game engine for visualization, so the data relating to CO2, switching on/off, absorption and crowding of the environments can be viewed. The data connected within the Game Engine in this phase only dealt with some portions of the available environments, the visualization led to the monitoring of an office area and a corridor area for presence checks, while the CO2 was monitored extensively for both environments. The platform is currently connected and ready for any experiments, such as data reading or an increase in physical peripherals. The case study offers the possibility of further implementations for both the hardware and software sides. Among the objectives to be achieved, we will try to connect the PowerTags through the ModBus protocol, for a correct reading of the laboratory's energy consumption, and to increase the number of peripherals and register them on an ad hoc network service, segregated from the external network, in in order to make monitoring more widespread with respect to the environment and current solutions. On the software side, the missing nodes will be integrated to develop and consolidate the overall functionality, improve the connectivity of the model by replacing the current exchange based on textual input with an ad hoc websocket service and increase its functionality by allowing the visualization not only of real-time data but also of historical data directly in the model. The historicization of at least one month of progressive operation is to be completed in order to begin the implementation of the ML algorithms for the development of forecasts relating to the use of spaces and energy within the environments. Once suitable times are reached, they can then be used widely for possible monitoring and forecasting on an annual basis. For comparison two similar works, developed by X. Zhang et al. (X. Zhang et al., 2023) and Muthiah-Nakarajan et al. (Muthiah-Nakarajan et al., 2021) discuss about the utilization of Machine Learning tools to reduce energy consumption in building also considering the presence of an Electric Veicle charging station. However, the two papers do not consider the integration of Machine Learning approach in a Digital Twin system.  Moreover, the present study discusses about the integration of many physical data comings from  156  different sensors (air quality, temperatures, weather, pressure, humidity, occupancy) and from the building itself (materials, HVAC, geometries, electric powered devices). Therefore, the presented approach can be considered innovative and aimed at developing a holistic model for building energy optimization purposes.  2.7 Results An Energy Management System (EMS) is a suite of integrated tools and strategies designed to monitor, control, and optimize the performance of the generation and load profiles in real-time. Deployed initially in 2022, the EMS at the SmartLAB has been a pivotal instrument in understanding the energy consumption patterns and making improvements based on quantitative experimental results, which will be detailed in subsequent sections. While the EMS focuses primarily on optimizing energy utilization, it's essential to underscore the holistic approach to sustainable operations. Parallelly, the SmartLAB has an operational Air Quality Management System (AQMS) aligned with pre-established management protocols. It monitors air contaminants and ensures optimal indoor air quality, crucial for both human health and efficient operation of laboratory equipment. The AQMS is in the process of collating historical data, which, upon reaching a significant volume, will serve as training datasets for a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm. This approach leverages ML's potential in predicting and improving indoor air quality based on patterns and trends. Over a span exceeding one-year, continuous monitoring has been conducted in the SmartLAB, capitalizing on sophisticated sensors. These sensors, integrated into a network, relay their readings to a Digital Twin platform. Upon comprehensive analysis of this data, the lab's energy consumption was delineated. A benchmark was set using a certified software which predicted an annual energy intake of 15.612 kWh. Diving deeper into the granularities of the data, we discerned the consumption metrics associated with individual socket points and the integrated lighting system. It's pivotal to note that each socket point was tagged to specific apparatuses, ranging from computational devices to routine appliances such as coffee machines. Given the architectural uniformity of the two workspaces examined, characterized by an identical configuration, equipment count, and operational hours, it provided a unique opportunity. This uniformity allowed for an extrapolation of the data, thereby estimating the energy consumption for the entire laboratory infrastructure. Methodology 157  Furthermore, a methodical observation of the lab's lighting system was executed, shedding light on its consumption metrics that were automatically detected through machine learning load recognition algorithms, as demonstrated in the following paragraphs. Subsequent graphical representations will illustrate device-wise consumption across a typical day (Figure  50-53) and week .          158                                     Figure  50. Energy consumption monitored over a typical day Methodology 159      Figure  51. Energy consumption monitored over a typical week              160        From the development of the specific consumption obtained from the initial data monitored in the two workspaces, an average daily consumption of 35Wh was achieved during the operating hours of the Smart Lab.   Figure  52. SmartLAB overall consumption on a month (April 2023) Methodology 161  2.7.1 Intelligent Energy Management Machine learning (ML), a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), is fundamentally rooted in the concept of enabling systems to acquire knowledge not from explicit code but from vast swathes of data. This paradigm shift is transformative: systems evolve based on patterns and regularities within datasets (Scannapieco & Tomazzoli, 2018). Drawing parallels with human cognition, just as young children refine their understanding of the world through experiential learning, ML models \"learn\" and \"refine\" through training data. The underlying algorithms, often referred to as \"machine-learning algorithms,\" iterate and improve their performance as they process more data (Bock, 2007).  The efficacy of an ML model is contingent upon both the quality and quantity of the training data. A richer dataset invariably lends itself to more robust model performance. Once the training phase culminates, these models can make predictions or classifications given new input data. It's pivotal to note that the computational intensity during the training phase far eclipses that during the model's execution or inference stage. Training, especially with deep neural networks, demands resources that are often orders of magnitude greater, necessitating specialized hardware like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) (Marques et al., 2019), (Marques & Pitarma, 2016). In the context of SmartLAB, the proposal to deploy a ML architecture stems from the imperative to derive insights from the vast troves of data it generates. This data, when centralized, takes the form of structured tuples, typically represented as {location, date-time, object, value}. This structured approach aids in segregating data by individual locations or units. With this granularity, it becomes feasible to discern the operational status of individual objects - be they energy consumers like appliances or producers like solar panels. Such temporal and spatial granularity allows stakeholders to gauge, for each monitored interval, which devices are in operation at specific locales. A powerful method to extract such insights is through rule-based machine learning techniques, notably Association Rule Learning. Such methods unravel correlations, helping delineate operational patterns and, subsequently, optimize energy consumption and production dynamics.  2.7.2 Association Rule Learning The pursuit of an optimal energy management strategy underscores the need for an intelligent system that harmonizes electrical loads with anticipated self- 162  energy-production. When bolstered with insights from Earth observation mechanisms, such as the Copernicus system, the potential of this synergy leaps forward. Preliminary estimations posit an efficiency augmentation of over 10%, translating to a stark reduction in the building complex's reliance on external distribution networks to a mere 15% of its overall energy consumption. The intricacies of energy efficiency within building structures are manifold, largely due to the cumulative effect of myriad small loads. True energy conservation, without compromising on functionality, demands a sophisticated approach. This entails meticulous monitoring and adaptive control of energy loads, leveraging real-time data on their state, power level, and dynamic interactions within the consumption-production continuum. Given the heterogeneity and sheer volume of devices in play, invoking principles from \"Ubiquitous and Pervasive Computing\" emerges as a cogent strategy to manage the computational demands of this multifaceted challenge. While the energy dynamics of each building are uniquely tethered to its structural design and user preferences, one cannot overgeneralize energy-saving strategies. Yet, there exists a realm of \"best practices\" tailored for energetically congruent environments. To actualize an autonomous energy management framework, a pivotal step involves the derivation of behavioral heuristics for diverse energy consumers. By closely observing and learning from varied energy behaviors, the system can dynamically evolve these \"best practices\", harnessing the prowess of machine learning techniques whose efficacy is well-established in academic literature. Such an ambitious venture mandates addressing a trifold set of sub-challenges (Tomazzoli et al., 2023b). 1. Categorization Strategy: Formulating methodologies to cluster installations based on energy efficiency commonalities. 2. Rule Source Determination: Identifying the pivotal installation within each cluster that serves as the learning paradigm. 3. Rule Derivation: Engaging in profound analytics to extract actionable rules from the consumption patterns of the designated installation. Complicating this mission is the inherent volatility of household energy loads, which flow with technological evolution and shifting human behaviors. Hence, a system's digital mapping must be perpetually rejuvenated, ensuring fidelity to the ground reality. This introduces two additional complexities (Tomazzoli et al., 2023b) a. Dynamic Load Representation: Crafting an adaptive schema that lucidly captures the current energy loads within a system.  Methodology 163  b. Device Recognition: Incorporating mechanisms that intuitively discern and catalog devices integral to an installation.  2.7.3 Clustering energy environments The landscape of machine learning is dotted with a plethora of techniques aimed at deciphering patterns within data. One of the cornerstones of this analytical arsenal is the conceptualization of data points within a multidimensional vector space. This paradigm paints a holistic picture of the dataset, mapping each unique entity (in our case, an energy environment or plant) as a distinct point in this expansive space. Imagine an energy environment as a complex amalgam of features: power usage, type of energy sources, consumption patterns, efficiency metrics, and more. Each of these features can be conceived as a dimension in our vector space. Consequently, an energy plant with a specific set of these features can be pinpointed as a unique vector in this space. The positioning of this vector is dictated by the values of its features, effectively transforming abstract characteristics into quantifiable coordinates. The use of representing energy plants in this geometric format is the inherent potential to gauge similarity. Plants that share analogous energy features will inevitably reside closer within the vector space, whereas those with divergent characteristics will be spaced further apart. In mathematical parlance, this spatial closeness is often quantified using distance metrics, such as the Euclidean distance. Clustering, in essence, is grouping entities based on their similarity. In our multidimensional vector space, a cluster is envisaged as a congregation of points (energy environments) that reside within close proximity to one another. The criterion for this proximity is often dictated by a predetermined threshold. If the distance between two points falls below this threshold, they are deemed similar and thus belong to the same cluster. K-means and hierarchical clustering Understanding the structure of data, especially in complex datasets like energy environments, is critical. Clustering algorithms facilitate this by grouping data points based on inherent similarities. Among the vast array of clustering techniques, K-means and hierarchical clustering are notably prominent. Here's a comprehensive exploration of both: K-means clustering aims to partition a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping subsets (or clusters). It does this by minimizing the variance within each cluster and maximizing the variance between clusters.  164  \uf0b7 Initialization: K cluster centroids are randomly chosen. \uf0b7 Assignment: Each data point is assigned to the closest centroid, and it becomes a member of that cluster. \uf0b7 Update: The centroid of each cluster is recalculated as the mean of all points in that cluster. \uf0b7 Repeat: Steps 2 and 3 are iterated until the centroids no longer change significantly, indicating that the algorithm has converged. Unlike K-means, which partitions the dataset outright, hierarchical clustering creates a tree of clusters. This tree, often visualized as a dendrogram, can be dissected at various levels to yield different clustering structures. \uf0b7 Initialization: Each data point is treated as a single cluster, meaning there are N clusters at the start (where N is the number of data points). \uf0b7 Agglomeration: In each of the subsequent stages, the two clusters that are closest to each other are merged into a single cluster. \uf0b7 Completion: This merging process is repeated until there is only one single cluster containing all data points. Both K-means and hierarchical clustering are heavily reliant on distance metrics to gauge the similarity between data points. Common metrics include: \uf0b7 Euclidean Distance: Geometric distance in the multidimensional space. \uf0b7 Manhattan Distance: Sum of absolute differences between coordinates. \uf0b7 Cosine Similarity: Measures cosine of the angle between two vectors. Without loss of generality, we can say that every energy load belongs to a specific type such as, for instance: light bulb, microwave induction plate, TV set, refrigerator. We define T = {t1 . . . tn} as the set of all possible types of devices belonging to any energy environment of a system S.  The feature representation of a plant pi (denoted by ~pi) is a n-dimensional vector whose j-th component ~pij , with 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n, is the number of devices of type tj in pi so that it can be considered a point in a vector space, as represented in Figure  53.  Consider, for instance, a system S with three consumers p1, p2, and p3 where:  \uf0b7 plant p1 consists of two computers, ten light bulbs and one microwave induction plate;  \uf0b7 plant p2 consists of one refrigerator, two TV sets, one washing machine, and one induction plate; \uf0b7 plant p3 consists of five computers, one microwave induction plate, one refrigerator and one light bulb.  Methodology 165  The set of all device types in S is thus T = {light bulb, Computer, Refrigerator, Microwave induction plate, TV set, Washing machine, Induction plate} and the feature representation of the aforementioned plants is  \u2192 \ud835\udc5d1 = [10 2 0 1 0 0 0] \u2192 \ud835\udc5d2 = [0 0 1 0 2 1 1] \u2192 \ud835\udc5d3 = [1 5 1 1 0 0 0]  Figure  53. Vector plant representation and clustering As a straightforward consequence, plants may be univocally represented in the n-dimensional vector space induced by |T| and a clustering algorithm such as k-means can be applied to isolate groups of similar plants.  2.7.4 Selecting exemplary performers in Energy Clusters The process of pinpointing high-performing energy plants within their respective clusters is foundational to the establishment of benchmarks and best practices. Let's delve into the rationale and methods behind this approach:  \uf0b7 Benchmarking: Identifying the top-performing plant within a cluster provides a standard against which others in the group can be compared. This fosters a competitive environment and encourages plants to strive for efficiency. \uf0b7 Learning from the Best: By scrutinizing the operational strategies and technologies of the top performers, valuable insights can be gleaned that can be disseminated to other members of the cluster, promoting energy-saving practices. \uf0b7 Motivation for Continuous Improvement: Recognizing and celebrating top-performers can incentivize other plants to constantly seek improvement in their operations. The methodology is described below.  166  1. Gather Data: Obtain energy consumption data for all plants in a cluster for a specific duration. This data can be sourced from utility bills, meter readings, or energy management systems. 2. Standardize the Time Frame: Ensure that the comparison is made over a consistent period, such as monthly, quarterly, or annually, to guarantee accuracy. 3. Compare and Rank: Rank plants based on their energy consumption. The plant with the lowest consumption, which implies the highest efficiency, emerges as the leader. 4. Adjust for External Factors: Ensure that the comparison is fair by considering external factors that might affect energy usage. These can include variations in production volume, weather patterns affecting heating or cooling needs, or periods of maintenance downtime. 5. Validation: To further validate the results, one could also examine the energy cost. Since energy prices can fluctuate based on demand, time-of-use, and other market dynamics, the energy bill provides a tangible metric that reflects both consumption and cost-effectiveness. 6. Feedback Loop: Communicate the results to all plants within the cluster. Encourage knowledge sharing and collaboration to lift the performance of all members. While the \"best\" plants serve as role models, it's essential to remember that every plant operates within its unique constraints and opportunities. The goal isn't necessarily for every plant to emulate the leader but to understand the efficient practices and apply them in ways that make sense for their specific context.  2.7.5 Extraction of Behavioral Rules from Energy consumption data Understanding the energy behavior of the best-performing environments is fundamental to extracting best practices and formulating strategies for efficient energy consumption. When dealing with extensive datasets that capture configurations and time series of energy usage data, rule-based methods like association rule learning are beneficial. However, a detailed methodology is required to extract meaningful insights: Data Representation: 1. Energy Consumption Dataset (D)  Represents the energy consumption of a system. Each data point captures: \uf0b7 Plant: the specific energy environment or setup. \uf0b7 Device: the specific gear or equipment consuming energy. \uf0b7 Power Value: energy level or power consumption of the device. Methodology 167  \uf0b7 Timestamp: the time when the measurement was taken.  2. Identification of relevant moments In any energy environment, not all moments are equally significant. Some moments reflect a change in configuration \u2013 a device being turned on/off, or a significant surge or drop in energy usage. These moments, called \"relevant moments,\" are pivotal for understanding energy behavior. Method: \uf0b7 From the dataset D, isolate records for each installation in the form: {device, power value, timestamp}. \uf0b7 Identify changes in power values. The corresponding timestamps become the candidate relevant moments. \uf0b7 Mark devices as active (power value > threshold) or inactive (power value <= threshold) based on the recorded power value.  3. Forming Configurations at relevant moments From the isolated records, derive a set of binary configurations corresponding to each relevant moment. Dataset D0: an itemset of configurations at relevant moments. \uf0b7 Each element d_0_i is labeled with a relevant moment. \uf0b7 Contains binary variables representing the activity status of each device at that moment. Variable Set V0: Contains binary variables for each device in system S, indicating active (1) or inactive (0) status. 4. Association Rule Mining With the data in the form of D0, association rule mining, such as the Apriori algorithm, can be applied to identify patterns and relationships between different devices' operational statuses. Example of a rule: \uf0b7 computer \u2192\u223c TV set o Meaning: If the computer is on, the TV set is likely off.  5. Rule Refinement and Learning Extracted rules can be further refined by: \uf0b7 Combining rules that overlap or are closely related. \uf0b7 Identifying exceptions where general rules may not apply.  168  \uf0b7 Assigning priorities to different rules based on frequency, importance, or other metrics.  2.7.6 Automatic load recognition using Text Mining and Machine Learning Ensuring the real-time accuracy of the composition of an installation is pivotal for the effective implementation of the method. Maintaining an updated database of connected devices is not only labor-intensive but is also susceptible to accumulating errors over time. Such inconsistencies pose a significant risk to the validity of the entire best-practices-based method. Thus, there's an imperative need to devise a solution that accurately mirrors the actual load in an energy system. In a theoretical framework, the power consumption of a device can be delineated as a continuous power-over-time function. In practical scenarios, however, measurements are typically acquired at discrete intervals. Thus, a pragmatic approximation of the power consumption curve can be obtained using linear interpolation between these discrete data points. When translating this sequence of energy measurements into a symbolic representation (as depicted in Figure  54), patterns such as \"OOOOVOOOOOOOPOOVOOOOOPO\" can be observed. To further refine this representation, consecutive similar symbols can be condensed, resulting in sequences like \"O VO O PO VO O PO\", thereby transmuting the power curve of a device into a textual footprint, termed \"energy words\". Drawing parallels from the established domain of text mining provides valuable insights. In the realm of text analytics, the bag-of-words model (Harris, 1954) suggests that textual entities sharing a greater number of common \"words\" or tokens are intrinsically more similar than those with fewer overlaps. Extending this analogy to our context, the energy word sequence of a device can be conceptualized as its unique \"bag of energy words.\" Consequently, the process of automated energy load classification can be succinctly encapsulated as: given a repository of predefined (labeled) devices and a newly introduced, unclassified device, the classification of this new device is ascertained by juxtaposing its energy word sequence with the energy word bags of the known devices. Through this comparative analysis, the unknown device is assigned to the most congruent category or class. Methodology 169   Figure  54. Alphabetic mapping applied to power measure In the realm of energy consumption optimization, the employment of best practices becomes paramount. However, defining a universally applicable set of best practices is challenging, given the heterogeneity of installations which can vary based on their intended use, be it residential (home), commercial (office), or hybrid (mixed-use), and the unique layouts they encompass. To address this challenge, leveraging machine learning, particularly clustering algorithms, can be instrumental. Clustering allows us to automatically categorize installations based on predefined similarity metrics, facilitating the management of large-scale energy systems. In creating a feature vector for each unit, every energy consumer and producer is meticulously cataloged and classified by type, ensuring a comprehensive representation of all energy elements within the structure (Tomazzoli et al., 2023b). For this undertaking, the K-means algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning technique, was employed. The algorithm's efficacy lies in its ability to discern and cluster units that exhibit analogous energy consumption patterns. Subsequent to the clustering phase, an observational period is designated. Post this phase, for each identified cluster, a representative location is chosen based on its energy performance metrics. This representative model, or a centroid, is then utilized to derive behavioral energy consumption rules, which can then be applied across all units within that specific cluster. Given real-time data acquisition capabilities, at any given instant, the configuration of an arbitrary apartment, say \"Ai\", can be juxtaposed against the centroid model \"As\". A potential application of this could be in the formation of actionable rules. For instance, consider the rule: \"At time instance 'tk', compare the state of device type 'dj' of apartment 'Ai' (dAij) with its counterpart in the centroid model 'As' (dAsj). If states are congruent, no action is necessitated; otherwise, toggle the state of 'dAij' to mirror that of 'dAsj'.\"  170  Such rules can be meticulously formulated into machine-executable formats, termed Association Rules. A quintessential association rule in an energy grid context might appear as: TheSolarPanel IsOn \u2192 TheWashingMachineIsOn. To derive such rules, the Apriori Algorithm, renowned for mining frequent item sets for boolean association rules, was employed. This algorithm operates by recognizing recurrent individual items within the dataset and successively aggregates them until a predefined frequency threshold is met. Once formulated, these models can be integrated into the control modules of each unit, providing either advisory recommendations or mandating specific energy consumption patterns. However, an intrinsic limitation of such automated systems is their susceptibility to inconsistencies between the digital representation and the actual built environment. For instance, during the lifecycle of an establishment, the relocation or replacement of smart plugs can inadvertently introduce discrepancies in the energy model. To counteract such discrepancies, AI-driven techniques have been devised. One such technique involves converting the power consumption curve of a device into a series of symbolic representations, termed \"energy words\". Thereafter, the Na\u00efve Bayes classifier, a probabilistic supervised learning method, discerns the nature of each energy load. This assists the system in identifying disparities between the digital representation and the actual connected load. Notably, the dictionary cataloging these \"energy words\" has expanded to over 60,000 entries. To mitigate potential dimensionality issues, any word appearing fewer than three times within the energy footprint was excluded. The predictive accuracy of the model, constructed using the Na\u00efve Bayes classifier, underwent rigorous validation. It was subjected to both a 66% training and 33% testing data split, and a ten-fold cross-validation method. For this purpose, the open-source machine learning software \"Weka\" (specifically the class weka.classifier.bayes.NaiveBayes) was employed.   171    172        Chapter 4     Discussions    Although energy consumption in industry has been studied in deep, when dealing with residential compounds or SOHO (Small Office Home Office) buildings we cannot directly borrow solutions from research experiences. In fact, the overall consumption is the sum of small contributions by a considerable amount and variety of devices, while in industrial environments there are generally few big powers draining that can be controlled one by one. Therefore, the problem of energy savings in buildings is strictly connected to the need of measuring and controlling energy loads in an efficient way, which can evolve complex scenarios. Several sensors and actuators must be involved, and their data shall be interconnected so that an ad-hoc algorithm derives the correct energy saving policy (e.g., a motion sensor shares data with electrical relays able to switch on/off the correct devices). A possible general solution is the adoption of best practices, which are hard to define due to the nature of all installations being quite different according to final uses (home, office, mixed use) and layouts; if grouped by location and similarities parameters (Westermann et al., 2020) Artificial Intelligence becomes able to automatize processes attributing each location to the most appropriate group, or cluster.  This aim can be achieved using machine techniques known as \u201cUnsupervised learning\u201d: these techniques refer to machine learning algorithms used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labelled responses Discussions 173  (Uhlemann et al., 2017). Unsupervised learning conducts an iterative process, analysing data without human intervention. The most common unsupervised learning method are cluster analysis and neural networks (recently led to deep learning). K-means is one of the simplest unsupervised learning algorithms that solve the well-known clustering problem. The procedure follows a simple and easy way to classify a given data set through a certain number of clusters (assume k clusters) fixed in a \u201ca priori\u201d logic. The main idea is to define k centroids, one for each cluster. These centroids should be placed specifically and in a cunning way since the result is strongly influenced by their position. The first step is to define the most efficient and performing context for each group or cluster by considering the energy bill over a few months confirmed by the energy data collected over a given interval of time.  The desired \u201clocal sample\u201d is the one with higher energy performances regarding to all other component of its cluster. Moreover, every automated system can easily fail if the digital representation of built environment doesn\u2019t match reality. Assuming that, inevitably during the lifetime of a building, some smart plug will be connected to different devices, this load variation can affect the reliability and accuracy of the digital model (Saini et al., 2020b). In order to keep the digital model continuously up-to-date, Artificial Intelligence techniques, using analytical processes similar to those of text analyses, transform a power absorption curve of a single device in a sequence of characters; than a supervised learning method named \u201cNa\u00efve Bayes classifier\u201d automatically identify the type of each energy load, so that the system can detect a mismatch between the digital representation and what is actually connected to the network.  2.8  AI for Energy Management Basing on the aforementioned studies, a Machine Learning model architecture has been proposed in order to analyse the data coming from the Interdepartmental Research Centre for Territory, Construction, Restoration and Environment (CITERA) SmartLAB located in Rome at the faculty of Architecture \u201cValle Giulia\u201d. The full architecture of models proposed is reported in the schematic of Figure 55. As can be seen the data architecture consists of a physical layer that contains the main physical data coming from sensors and the building, a Machine Learning layer that contains the data to be extracted from the physical layer,  174  and a physical action layer that is user oriented and is aimed at defining the main output for an Intelligent Digital Twin (IDT).   Figure 55. IDT\u2019s layers architecture In the chart all data coming as input/output from the previous node/model shall be used as input in the next note. Moreover, Machine Learning layer shows also the most suitable and promising models to apply for the different tasks, the choices are based on the literature studies and are listed below: Air quality forecasting: Air quality can be evaluated by Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) (Ugwuanyi, 2021). The model can be also used as classifier (for bad, average, and good air quality forecasting) and as regressor to give an estimation of the previsioned value. The model can be used both for indoor and outdoor air quality and it can be used as an input for comfort estimation and loads prediction (combined with the power needed by the ventilation system). For natural ventilation Deep Q-Network (DQN) model can be used to compare the contribution of opening windows on air quality in case of expected high outdoor values of PM (An et al., 2021). End users can also directly visualize data to understand the air quality expected in the next hours. Considering its importance, a good interpretability is fundamental to guide the choices of the decision-maker upon any eventual intervention on the building as for installing new air purifiers. Input data can be also integrated with and from the local weather services. Heat-Exchanging modelling: The purpose of modelling heat-exchangers should be underestimated by the end user; however, this data is fundamental to Discussions 175  determining the efficiency of the HVAC system and to monitor the status of the exchangers. If the efficiency lowers too much there could be some issues related to fouling or leakages, therefore a maintenance intervention shall be scheduled. Knowing efficiencies is also useful for future intervention where the destination of spaces changes (as for the number of people inside the environment) or in case of renovations that can alter the geometry of the building. This model can be neglected if no one of this element is deemed important by the decision maker. The best model to calculate Heat-Exchanging efficiencies is Nonlinear AutoRegressive Exogenous (NARX) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) MultiLayer Perpetron (MLP) as showed in the work of Z. Chen, Xiao, et al. (Z. Chen, Xiao, et al., 2022) and C. Yu et al. (C. Yu et al., 2020). HVAC efficiency estimation: Support Vector Machine (SVD) with Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) can be used to estimate HVAC efficiency basing on physical data as demonstrated in the work of C. Fan et al. (C. Fan et al., 2019). Using the data coming from the model it is possible to control the air conditioning using on a best efficiency approach and thus reducing the total energy usage of the device. Moreover, the output can be also used as input for the load prediction model to calculate the expected electrical consumption of the building. Solar radiation forecasting: The solar radiation can be obtained from local weather service data but also calculated in the specific position (that is subject to shading or partial coverage due to the placement of the photovoltaic panels). Deep Neural Networks with Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) can be used for the task (H. Wang et al., 2020). The data interpretability is useful to understand if there are shading elements that interacts with the surfaces and to program intervention, as example to increase the energy production obtained from the panels or to reduce or increase the solar heat contribution for the building. The tool can be also used to model the effect of increasing the panel surface on the building by increasing the number of panels. Moreover, solar radiation in an input for the photovoltaic energy production model and for the thermal load model. Thermal load prevision: Calculating thermal loads contributes to the determination of the building power consumption. Moreover, using Machine Learning tools is theoretically possible to assess the effect of outdoor condition to the total heat loss of the building Also any eventual intervention aimed at increasing the building insulation could be evaluated. The best previsioning Machine Learning model for thermal loads prevision is probably Artificial Neural Network (ANN) improved with a Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME) for the interpretation of results (Di Natale et al., 2022). In case of high natural ventilation, as for Near Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB), it is possible to divide the contribution of natural ventilation on the thermal load  176  using an ANN model with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to increase model interpretability (H. Park & Park, 2021). Knowing the most influential factor of thermal loads permits to evidence the criticalities that needs to be addressed to increase the global energy performance of the building. Thermal load prevision uses as input the data coming from weather, occupancy, natural ventilation, HVAC, and the building geometries and materials. Instead, the model output is used as input for the electrical power provisioning model and for the air quality model.  Occupancy prevision: Predict the number of people present in an environment in a specific time is a challenge, especially if there are no information about the number of people obtained by presence sensors. However, despite the difficulties, monitoring the number of people is a fundamental data that influences many parameters such as the air quality, thermal comfort, and power consumption. Therefore, Machine Learning could be very useful in addressing such issue as reported in the review of Dai et al. (Dai et al., 2020). A suitable Machine Learning tool for the task is Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) enhanced by a SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) model for interpretability. As input the model it is possible to use building data, CO2 concentration (or direct air quality measurements), power loads and presence sensors data. Then, occupancy data can be used as input for air quality forecasting, thermal load prevision, and indoor comport calculation. It must consider that, occupancy data is also a sensible information for security and safety, its knowledge must be controlled and not open to the public. Moreover, decision makers could use the previsions coming from the occupancy model also to dimension building services (as for calculating the number of people that need to eat at lunchroom, determining the number of parking needed, etc.) and to globally increase the building ergonomic. HVAC Control: Controlling HVAC permits to reduce and adapt the energy consumption of the building by changing the power used by the air conditioning system. An effective predictive control model can be developed using by using a Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II as suggested by M. G. Yu & Pavlak (M. G. Yu & Pavlak, 2022), moreover, if an alert system is implemented it is possible to use a Decision Tree algorithm to deliver textual useful information to users and stakeholder (Mollo Neto et al., 2020; Tai et al., 2020) such as if the HVAC system delivers enough cooling, if it is recommended to move from the building due to the excessive  load and other such information. The Control model takes as input the HVAC efficiency model, the indoor comfort prevision model, and the load prediction model to calculate the optimal response for controlling the HVAC. As output the model can relate to an alert and maintenance system, with the load management (deactivating unused electrical equipment by smart-plugs controls in case of high loads), with the Discussions 177  electrical actuator control (opening windows when the HVAC is off and the air quality and thermal comfort is good), and with the HVAC system itself.  Indoor comfort prevision: This model is aimed at evaluating the thermal comfort of the indoor area in the building. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are very suitable for comfort prevision tasks (Charalampopoulos, 2019). To develop alerts and recommendations to users and stakeholders both K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Tree models can be used (Mollo Neto et al., 2020; Tai et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2022; Yusuf Akbar et al., 2022). It must be considered that thermal comfort is a matter of legislation as expressed in EN ISO 7730 (Cheng et al., 2012; Fanger, 1986; ISO, 2005). Therefore, some empirical rules are recommended to aid the comfort model to maintain comfort values inside an acceptable range. As model input shall be used the data coming from the air quality forecasting model and the occupancy model and the thermal load model. As output the model can deliver alerts, act on building electrical actuators (as for opening windows), and on the HVAC control model. Solar power availability: To model the power output coming from solar panels Lu et al. developed a Deep Neural Network integrated enhanced by a SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to increase model for interpretability (Y. Lu et al., 2021). The model is useful to provide prevision on the expected power developed by solar panels and managing the power usage inside the building looking for energy neutrality (when consumption is equal to load). In this case the building efficiency is the highest and consumption are null, therefore it is the best operative case. However, the balance between load and production is usually different from zero and energy shall be stored in batteries or taken/delivered from the electrical network. Therefore, the model takes as input the solar radiation forecasting and the battery capacity to optimize the energy management and reduce consumptions. As output the model contributes to the input the loads prediction model. Load profiling: Profiling loads is fundamental for the understanding of what is connected to the electrical network and to monitor if there are some faults in the devices. For this tasks Wastensteiner et al. proposed a Machine Learning Model that employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) to increase the CNN interpretability (Wastensteiner et al., 2021). The use of a load profiling model can be also applied to monitor fraudulent energy usages identifying malevolent users as evidenced by (M. Wang et al., 2022). Knowing what is connected to the electrical system is usually a requirement made by decision makers for building management purposes. The model takes as input the data coming electrical loads and external loads (the EV charging station in the case of CITERA Smart-Lab). As output, energy profiles are an input of the load prediction model.  178  Loads prediction: Loads prediction is the main goal of any energy monitoring machine learning network. There are many literature studies that are focused on this issue; therefore, the solution is not unique. In the present work a Deep Neural Network model with a Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) is proposed. To develop alerts and recommendations to users and stakeholders a Decision Tree models can be used (Mollo Neto et al., 2020; Tai et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2022; Yusuf Akbar et al., 2022). Interpreting load prediction is considered a fundamental requirement for stakeholders because they need to know how to operate the power systems, which load is prevalent and to develop energy reports for the assessment of the energy class of the building. The model takes as input the HVAC efficiency model, the loads profiling model, the solar power availability, the thermal load model, and the occupancy prevision model. As output the model can deliver alerts, act on actuators, recommending maintenance activities and reducing the HVAC power usage. Fault detection: The last model is related to FDD, a good maintenance keeps the building efficient avoiding issue related to shot-circuit, End-of-Life (EoL) of devices, efficiency reduction, etc. There are many models that are specific to different equipment, as for air handling units (C. Fan et al., 2021). The proposed approach is to use two different models, one to detect numerically the efficiency reduction and one to interpretate errors and metadata data coming from sensors and devices. For numerical data a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model can be used tanks to its capability in interpretating data coming from very different devices (G. Li et al., 2021). For the metadata it is recommended to use an encoding-decoding model (C. Li et al., 2022). As input the model takes data coming from the physical layer devices and as output the model deliver alerts and can shut down faulty devices using the actuators.  4.2  Towards Smart Districts and Energy Communities The integration of digital technologies is key to initiating optimization processes with data-driven methodologies that lead to real-time monitoring of all the functional parameters that characterize the energy and environmental behavior of buildings and infrastructures. Indeed, only through continuous and real-time in-depth knowledge of physical, operational, usage, and performance parameters, combined with knowledge of boundary conditions, the system is capable of autonomously reacting to maintain optimal operating parameters both under standard conditions and in the event of unforeseen events. Such an approach becomes increasingly relevant for managing assets of considerable size and number, becoming essential for the governance of energy Discussions 179  districts, where the significant amount of data requires management techniques based on Artificial Intelligence and machine learning. The main objective of Digital Twin-based and data-driven approaches on an urban scale concern improving the energy efficiency of buildings and infrastructures, as well as implementing strategies for defining energy districts through a system architecture able to interface with users through a cloud-based platform. In the perspective of decentralizing electric energy production, the energy district can take on the role of the central core of a more extensive interconnected and scalable urban network, efficiently managed through Artificial Intelligence. In this scenario, the virtuous management of energy production requires a strategy for migrating consumption by the end-user. It is essential to align the network's maximum consumption with the peak renewable energy production time. This can be done on individual infrastructure, as well as through the creation of a smart grid capable of feeding the energy surplus into the network. Considering the heterogeneity of the energy district in terms of usage destinations and prosumer habits, non-renewable energy consumption can tend towards zero. The goal is to connect users of neighboring buildings in a single energy district, creating a cloud-based data platform that allows the integrated management of consumption and electric energy production, creating a virtuous, autonomous energy ecosystem capable of efficiently and effectively managing resources, distributing surplus energy among the prosumers, improving network efficiency, and minimizing waste. As such, the smart district's Digital Twin-based data platform will allow: \uf0b7 Archiving and profiling the habits of prosumers in the energy district; \uf0b7 Managing the amounts of energy produced from different renewable sources to be distributed to different prosumers based on their habits; \uf0b7 Sharing, dissemination, disclosure, and awareness-raising on energy-saving issues. To ensure the platform's usability, a scalable user interface is needed to implement the system architecture with different services and functionalities based on different needs of different users. Specifically, the cloud-based platform will need to interface with two types of users: \uf0b7 Technical staff and Infrastructure Management;  180  \uf0b7 Users of the Smart Energy District and Energy Community (tertiary, residential, commercial, etc.), local administrations, stakeholders, etc. The interpretation of the vast amount of data collected and updated in real time, and the subsequent profiling of users' energy consumption, through the use of specific machine learning (ML) algorithms validated following a monitoring period, allow the identification of preferential energy efficiency interventions, achieving the primary essential goal in the broader vision of a virtuous energy management of the built environment and the definition of a Smart Energy District and consequently an Energy Community. The amount of structured and unstructured data, directly proportional to the breadth and heterogeneity of the system's application area, results in the definition of Artificial Intelligence algorithms aimed at automatically implementing Intelligent Load Management operations, such as Load Shed and Load Shift (Figure  56), as well as reporting faults to the assets involved in the system through the analysis of anomalies in electrical loads, the prediction of consumption, and the estimation of future electrical costs. Specifically, the platform allows: \uf0b7 Real-time visualization of the infrastructure's electrical consumption through dynamic dashboards; \uf0b7 Analysis of loads and automatic recognition of consumption profiles to implement Intelligent Load Management actions: o Efficiency: Improvement of the energy efficiency of systems and components. o Load Shed: Reduction of load by distributing energy demand across multiple energy sources during peak usage periods.  o Load Shift: Management of energy supply and demand in such a way that the peak consumption is shifted to periods of low energy demand.  \uf0b7 Analysis of energy consumption and the production of electricity from renewable sources through integrated reports with possible intervention solutions; Figure  56. Load shift - shed Discussions 181  \uf0b7 Reporting faults to the assets involved in the system through the analysis of anomalies of electrical loads connected to the specific asset; \uf0b7 Creating a searchable database accessible at any time with the history of energy consumption connected to the infrastructure; \uf0b7 Archiving and profiling of user habits; \uf0b7 Forecasting consumption and estimating the future electrical costs of the building. To connect and incentivize the highest number of users with heterogeneous energy profiles to join the creation of a near-zero impact Smart Energy District and the Energy Community, a cloud-based system scaled based on the specific information and usage required by the user is necessary (Figure  57). This system can be translated into various services for users of the energy district that can monitor their consumption in real time and establish a relationship of sharing best practices, as well as take advantage of services such as data visualization, metaverse user experience, mixed reality, customer assistance, etc. Technical Manager & Stakeholders The data platform provides technical managers and stakeholders (owners and managers of real estate assets, local administrations, etc.) with: \uf0b7 Basic and technical data on assets; \uf0b7 Analytics on energy consumption and related costs; \uf0b7 Alerts and notifications for optimized interaction between the system and the user. People & Community Users of the Smart Energy District and the Energy Community can benefit from the services offered by the data platform through: \uf0b7 Web Apps; \uf0b7 Mobile Apps; \uf0b7 Immersive Reality & the Metaverse  182   Figure  57. Multi-service data platform Below are some of the objectives to be achieved towards the definition of a Digital Twin-based Data Platform for Energy Management in Smart Districts and Energy Communities in terms of system architecture.  The system is based on a Multi-Service Data Platform with a cloud architecture, integrating a data lake component for data ingestion and storage and a repository for unstructured data, as well as a data warehouse for managing certified data, and a set of specifically built data marts to meet the publishing needs through the Data Visualization and reporting component. Specifically, distinct data marts are planned where the calculation rules for the metrics needed to process the KPIs for monitoring and control areas will be implemented. The data ingestion component, using specific connectors, orchestrates data flows in streaming (near real-time) and batch modes, both structured and unstructured (data from sensors, documents, videos, images). The multi-service data platform will also have centralized governance that facilitates and simplifies the creation, protection, and management of data; the integrated data cataloging component allows secure publishing and management, defining the appropriate access levels and implementing data protection policies. The system comes with monitoring functions for the correct operation of application components and data transformation jobs and provides all the necessary auditing functions to verify access logs and configuration changes. Supporting the data processing functions, the platform will integrate an Artificial Intelligence Engine for energy management. Moreover, all necessary integrations towards the Data Presentation, BIM, Analytics, Command & Control, Mixed Reality, other external market systems and for exposing Open Data externally will be managed (Figure  58). Discussions 183     Figure  58. Data platform system architecture Data publication will occur through a data presentation component where monitoring and control dashboards can be created. The same component allows for the creation of reports that can be distributed to recipient lists either on a scheduled basis or upon the occurrence of specific events. Furthermore, the Analytics component will allow the user to perform data discovery and processing activities autonomously on the published data, either through the integration with office automation tools or by customizing the dashboards in a self-service manner. The Data Visualization component allows the integration of published dashboards into third-party applications. Within the multi-service data platform, a workflow management component allowing metadata configuration and information supporting the necessary monitoring dashboards, management of business rules for metric and monitoring KPI processing, as well as the definition of integration operation methods, the definition of alerts, and activation thresholds will be implemented. To support the publication and distribution of data, the platform also integrates the generation of alert events towards third-party applications using a service bus architecture sending push notifications when alert events occur, and querying all acquired data available in the data lake.  4.3  Energy storage optimization towards a Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) scenario The contemporary urban environment is becoming more shaped by the pursuit of eco-friendliness and energy conservation. Through the incorporation of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) into smart grid management, urban areas can  184  tap into a mix of energy resources to guarantee even nocturnal energy demands are met without relying on storage systems. Nevertheless, the volatile characteristics of essential renewable technologies, such as solar and wind, in conjunction with a rise in electrification, threaten the balance and reliability of the power grid. Various solutions to these issues include energy storage, utilizing steady power generators like nuclear or geothermal energy, long-range power transmission, excessive dependence on renewables causing surplus during low-consumption times, and transitioning electricity into gas forms. As expenses reduce, the prominence of battery storage as a method for energy conservation has risen, improving grid efficiency in multiple scenarios. Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) represents the two-way energy exchange between an electric vehicle's (EV) battery and the grid. To achieve the kind of stability offered by fixed batteries, genuine bidirectional V2G is essential, enabling energy to be both supplied to and drawn from EV batteries in a controlled manner. In this regard, the study by P.H. Kydd suggests a future where electric vehicles will play a pivotal role in energy storage and supply (Kydd, 2023). The storage capacity and power output of electric vehicles will see a significant rise over time, with a substantial potential impact on the electrical grid and the way energy is produced, distributed, and consumed.  Recent studies examined the potential of EVs in meeting grid storage needs investigating the utilization of EVs connected to the grid and batteries from retired EVs. Currently, most EV owners charge their cars at home overnight. When connected, these batteries could be repurposed for grid storage. By striking agreements with energy providers, EV owners can allow controlled charging and discharging of their batteries for grid support, earning financial incentives in return. When EV batteries deteriorate to 70-80% of their original capacity, they're typically unfit for transportation but can still serve in grid storage. The combined capacity from vehicle-to-grid and expired EV batteries is predicted to reach 32 to 62 terawatt-hours by 2050. In contrast, short-term grid storage needs might only be 3.4 to 19.2 TWh by that year, implying a potential surplus of battery storage supply. The study from Kydd reveals that only 12-43% of all EVs need to engage in vehicle-to-grid operations to meet global short-term grid-storage needs. This drops to under 10% if half the expired EV batteries are reused for grid storage. The adoption rate of these practices and the role of government incentives are crucial for maximizing EV contributions to grid storage. Effective participation requires user-friendly tools and strong regulations to recover and reintegrate batteries after their primary vehicle life (Kydd, 2023). Discussions 185  The chart below displays the projections for energy storage in electric vehicles (EV) in the United States from 2020 to 2050 (Figure  59).   Figure  59. Projections for energy storage in electric vehicles (EV) in the United States from 2020 to 2050 (Kydd, 2023)  \uf0b7 Total Fleet and Growth Rate: There are 253 million light vehicles in the United States in 2020, with an anticipated annual growth rate of 1%. \uf0b7 EV Percentage of Total: The proportion of electric vehicles out of the total vehicle count is expected to see a significant rise over time, going from 1% in 2020 to 75% by 2050. \uf0b7 Number of EVs: The total number of electric vehicles is projected to increase from 3 million in 2020 to 253 million by 2050. \uf0b7 Battery Capacity: The average battery capacity of electric vehicles is anticipated to grow over time. It starts at 55 kWh per vehicle in 2020 and is projected to reach 150 kWh per vehicle by 2050. \uf0b7 Total Storage Capacity: The overall energy storage capacity of electric vehicles will see a substantial increase, moving from 55 million kWh in 2020 to 37,908 million kWh by 2050. \uf0b7 EV Power Capacity: This refers to the maximum rate at which energy can be drawn from electric vehicle batteries. It's expected to rise from 68,750 MW in 2020 to 18,954,125 MW by 2050. \uf0b7 US Capacity: The total capacity of the United States will see a modest growth, from 456,308 MW in 2020 to 615,035 MW by 2050. The chart below shows the projected growth of V2G (Vehicle-to-Grid) technology from 2020 to 2040 (Figure  60).   186   Figure  60. Projected growth of V2G (Vehicle-to-Grid) technology from 2020 to 2040 (Kydd, 2023) Sales by Brand: \uf0b7 Ford: Ford sales are projected to rise from 200 thousand in 2020 to 2,140 thousand by 2040. \uf0b7 Chevy: Sales for Chevy are expected to increase from 150 thousand in 2025 to 3,211 thousand by 2040. \uf0b7 VW: VW's sales are anticipated to grow from 100 thousand in 2022 to 1,541 thousand in 2040. \uf0b7 Nissan: Nissan's sales are forecasted to align with VW's, increasing from 100 thousand in 2022 to 1,541 thousand by 2040. \uf0b7 Others: Sales from other brands are projected to rise from 100 thousand in 2022 to 1,238 thousand in 2040. \uf0b7 Total Sales: The combined sales from all brands indicate substantial growth during the period in focus. Total sales will increase from 200 thousand in 2020 to 8,771 thousand by 2040. \uf0b7 Total EV: The total number of electric vehicles (EV) in thousands will see a significant rise, from 200 in 2020 to 59,287 in 2040. \uf0b7 MWh: The overall capacity in MWh will experience a significant hike, moving from 20,000 MWh in 2020 to 5,928,663 MWh in 2040. In summary, studies depict a strong projected growth in V2G technology from 2020 to 2040, with a notable increase in V2G vehicle sales and the total MWh capacity. This implies a growing adoption and relevance of V2G technology in the transportation and energy sectors. By 2040, the energy storage capacity of V2G-compatible vehicles is estimated to account for 15% of the entire electric vehicle storage. This points to a growth equivalent to twenty times the daily solar energy supply and a similar amount to the daily usage of the EV fleet. This hints at a substantial potential for bidirectional V2G capabilities in the near future. Recent studies are examining the potential of electric vehicles (EVs) in meeting grid storage needs, investigating the utilization of EVs connected to the grid and batteries from retired EVs. Currently, most EV owners charge their cars at home overnight. When connected, these batteries could be repurposed for grid storage. Discussions 187  By striking agreements with energy providers, EV owners can allow controlled charging and discharging of their batteries for grid support, earning financial incentives in return. When EV batteries deteriorate to 70-80% of their original capacity, they're typically unfit for transportation but can still serve in grid storage. The researchers predict that the combined capacity from vehicle-to-grid and expired EV batteries could amass 32 to 62 terawatt-hours by 2050. In contrast, short-term grid storage needs might only be 3.4 to 19.2 TWh by that year, implying a potential surplus of battery storage supply. The study reveals that only 12-43% of all EVs need to engage in vehicle-to-grid operations to meet global short-term grid-storage needs. This drops to under 10% if half the expired EV batteries are reused for grid storage. The adoption rate of these practices and the role of government incentives are crucial for maximizing EV contributions to grid storage. Effective participation requires user-friendly tools and strong regulations to recover and reintegrate batteries after their primary vehicle life. The vehicle-to-grid capacity refers to the portion of EV battery stock capacity suitable for vehicle-to-grid applications, accounting for the capacity allocated for EV driving, the capacity of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) not participating in vehicle-to-grid due to limited capacity, and capacity decline resulting from battery degradation. EV batteries can serve a dual purpose, remaining within the vehicle for vehicle-to-grid utilization or being repurposed after the vehicle's end-of-life phase, where they are removed and utilized independently for stationary energy storage. \"Smart\" vehicle-to-grid charging strategies can facilitate dynamic EV charging and load-shifting grid services. EVs are capable of storing electricity and redistributing it to the grid during peak demand periods. As mentioned above, vehicle battery EoL is conventionally defined as the point at which the remaining battery capacity falls within the range of 70-80% of its original capacity. One crucial limitation is that these calculations presume that the rated capacity per vehicle will remain constant in the future and anticipate that a limited number of large battery electric vehicles (BEVs) could offer substantial actual vehicle-to-grid capacity. These capacities may undergo alterations in the future due to policy incentives, advancements in vehicle design, shifts in consumer preferences, enhancements in charging infrastructure, and various other influential factors. Moreover, the transportation ecosystem might experience profound and fundamental transformations, including a significant and rapid shift away from individual car usage toward mass transit, the adoption of shared electric vehicles, the implementation of autonomous driving technologies, and  188  the success of battery swapping systems, all of which could reshape the available capacity landscape by 2050. Using the Sustainable Development (SD) scenario, which envisions an electric vehicle fleet in line with the climate objectives of the Paris Agreement, the following graphs have been created by (C. Xu et al., 2023)to illustrate how the overall electric battery storage capacity is roughly evenly distributed between electric vehicles (EVs) and Energy Storage Systems (EoS) as in Figure  61.  Figure  61. Technical capacity (TWh) distributed between electric vehicles (EVs) and Energy Storage Systems (EoS) (C. Xu et al., 2023). The second graph (Figure  62), on the other hand, illustrates how, depending on the required power for storage in response to surpluses and the need to supply loads during a production deficit, Energy Storage Systems (EoS) can cover 100% of the demand up to a power requirement of 12 TWh (C. Xu et al., 2023). As the demand increases beyond 12 TWh and reaches 32 TWh, a portion of Electric Vehicles (EVs) becomes necessary for meeting the demand.  Figure  62. Second-use utilization rate vs. Vehicle-to-grid participation rate (C. Xu et al., 2023) In the context of the issue within Italy, and by focusing on batteries that are actually installed in the current vehicle fleet, excluding Energy Storage Systems Discussions 189  (EoS) for which current legislation may serve as a basis for future discussions, the following analysis can be made. Assuming the constant size of the circulating vehicle fleet in Italy until 2050, which is equal to about 39 million vehicles, and multiplying this number by the average annual mileage per vehicle in Italy, which is 6,800 kilometers per year, results in a total annual distance driven by our cars equal to [265.200.000.000 kilometers]. Given the current efficiency of electric cars, which consume about 20 kWh to travel 100 kilometers, there is an energy requirement for electric mobility equal to 53,04 TWh. According to the most recent document from the GSE (Gestore dei Servizi Energetici) on energy scenarios related to renewable sources and [insert relevant data], it is inferred that by 2050, the electricity produced will be equal to 321,5TWh (Figure  63).  Figure  63. The evolution of the electric mix by 2050  Assuming the current surplus production percentages by self-consumption data of year 2022 (as shown in Figure  64) of about 13% of the overall FV production, suitably reduced by 20% due to the progressive improvement in the  190  distribution network's efficiency, it can be hypothesized that by 2050, approximately 10% of the photovoltaic energy produced will be surplus to the load and will require storage.   Figure  64. Surplus production percentages by self-consumption data of year 2022  This surplus is equivalent to 32,5 TWh, which is less than the energy requirements of electric vehicles in circulation. Consequently, the present framework is oriented to manage energy production surplus through electric vehicles instead of traditional storage systems.    191  4.4 Final remarks The nexus between the built environment and energy utilization presents significant ramifications for global energy consumption, emissions, and the ongoing transition to more sustainable systems. Recent analyses reveal that buildings are responsible for consuming approximately 40% of global energy, contributing to over 70% of electricity consumption and nearly a third of all carbon emissions. As the energy landscape evolves, so does the interaction between the built environment and energy sources. The emergence of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) such as microgrids, nanogrids, and behind-the-meter energy storage introduces complexity but also opportunity. Other innovations, like grid-interactive efficient buildings and Electric Vehicle (EV) integration mechanisms (EV-to-grid, EV-to-home), are expanding the scope of demand response, ushering in a new era characterized by enhanced demand flexibility. With advancements on the Internet of Things (IoT) over the past decade, once rudimentary equipment is now equipped with sophisticated sensors and interconnected devices. This shift from minimal data to vast data repositories enables advanced anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, and other intelligent functionalities, leveraging machine learning and other advanced techniques. The inception of Digital Twins has revolutionized the modeling of context and environment in which new capabilities operate. Transitioning from smart offices to smart buildings and further to comprehensive smart spaces, showcasing its versatility across various scenarios including grid interactions and intelligent ecosystems, enhancing thermoigrometrical and IAQ real time parameters control. Modern grids are increasingly integrating renewable sources such as wind and solar, creating challenges associated with demand fluctuations and weather-dependent production. With new additions like local solar and electric vehicles, predicting energy dynamics becomes complex.  As the built environment plays a crucial role in this energy landscape, impacting both consumption patterns and infrastructure resilience. This study aims to contribute to the research on the topic of introducing digital twin ecosystems in the management of the built environment and energy smart grids, providing an operational framework supported by open-source tools and methods for the creation of intelligent digital twins capable of optimizing the energy management of buildings. As such it emerges from the study how the built environment intersects with multiple industry verticals. Whether it's a healthcare facility, a retail  192  distribution center, or a manufacturing plant, each has distinct energy needs and interfaces uniquely with the grid. The rapid digitization and IoT implementation, evident in innovations like smart poles integrated with EV charging, further blurs these boundaries. Incorporating digital twins, AI, and other advanced technologies enhances the ability to unlock significant capacities in the built environment. Embracing active efficiency \u2014 a blend of traditional energy-saving measures and digital transformation \u2014 ensures multi-dimensional benefits ranging from energy savings to improved grid resilience and building health. As the built environment continues to integrate more advanced technologies and aligns more closely with evolving energy systems, it will increasingly function as a dynamic component of broader energy networks. This transformation promises significant potential savings, both in terms of energy and costs, emphasizing the importance of ongoing research, collaboration, and policy support in this domain. Intelligent load management plays a pivotal role in optimizing energy efficiency. This revolves around several foundational principles: Load Shedding & Shifts: simply cutting down the energy consumption during peak times, or redistributing loads at various times, can lead to significant energy savings using at the same time electric car fleet as a bidirectional exchange between an electric vehicle's (EV) battery and the grid. This capability becomes particularly potent when integrated with advanced models and AI-driven capabilities. These technologies not only allow for better energy management but can also adjust based on varying external inputs, creating a dynamic system that reacts in real-time. Real Estate & Incentive Alignment: a challenge in energy management is the misalignment of incentives between property owners and tenants. Property owners may not feel the urge to invest in efficient systems as the cost savings are often passed to the tenants. Conversely, tenants might not be motivated to push for energy-efficient solutions for properties they don't own. Integrating AI-driven load management can create a win-win scenario. By optimizing energy usage, everyone benefits from the cost savings. Moreover, these savings can be integrated into a Distributed Energy Resource (DER) aggregation, adding another layer of benefits and incentives for various stakeholders. Advanced Control Systems & Reinforcement Learning: traditional control systems for managing energy loads have reached their capacity. While Fault Detection and Diagnostics (FDD) systems have made substantial progress, they still operate on static rules. This is where reinforcement learning, a subset of AI, offers transformative potential. By utilizing a technique that constantly learns and adapts, energy systems can optimize beyond what traditional algorithms Discussions 193  permit. This real-time adaptability means that energy systems can operate more efficiently, leading to substantial savings. An example is Microsoft's incorporation of Project Bonsai, which used reinforcement learning to increase energy savings from 15% to over 30%. Digital Twins & Federated Systems: the concept of a Digital Twin refers to a digital representation of a physical system. This can range from components of a building to an entire city grid. When these digital representations are interconnected, they create an intelligent ecosystem. This ecosystem can analyze vast amounts of data, from weather forecasts to energy prices, to optimize energy usage in real-time. The challenge lies in creating harmonized ontologies that allow for seamless data exchange between various digital twins. Open-source initiatives are working towards making this federation more streamlined. Equity in Energy Management: beyond efficiency, there's a need to ensure energy systems are equitable. As more sophisticated energy management solutions emerge, it's vital to ensure they benefit all sections of society. Furthermore, focusing on energy efficiency can particularly benefit low-income households, who proportionally spend more of their income on energy. Integrating AI and other advanced technologies in energy management can mitigate some of these disparities. In conclusion, while alternative energy sources like wind and solar are essential, optimizing our existing systems through Intelligent Digital Twins based on AI and advanced load management can lead to a more efficient and equitable energy landscape. The integration of these technologies is still a work in progress, but the potential benefits are immense.      194       195    References    Abramovici, M., G\u00f6bel, J. C., & Savarino, P.

The multi-agentsystem paradigm and societal structures were examined as an approach to a multi-stakeholderdomain and congregations were used as an aid to decentralisation in a non-hierarchical, non-market-based approach.

heat pumps, electric vehicles and small-scale generation intothe electricity grid at the household level is limited by technical constraints. This work addresses thissignificant challenge in power systems by presenting a novel approach that uses a decentralised multi-agent system where the controllers learn and use the location of equipment within the low-voltage sectionof the power system. The benefits include improved power quality, better environmental and economicperformance of small-scale generation, and a delay to network reinforcement of legacy electrical networks.The solution is implemented on a unique new test facility that combines real-time network simulation withembedded controllers to provide a electrical network/hardware/software-integrated multi-agent platform.The embedded controller platform developed for this project has enabled multi-agent system test-ing of a type that was not previously feasible: it combines real-time simulation of arbitrary electricalnetworks with any geographical/electrical arrangement of equipment, and low-cost, general-purpose em-bedded controller hardware, running an industry-standard multi-agent system platform. This facility isa significant asset for research into fuller exploitation of agent capabilities in electrical power systems.1.1 Structure of this ChapterThe research domain and background to this work are introduced in this chapter. The challenges presentedby existing infrastructure are explained and the new technologies that create the problem are described.By examining both the technological and regulatory environment, the significance of the problem isillustrated as a driver to push forward from the existing work in the area.The first section contains a description of the power system domain and how this work is a continuationof efforts into integrating new technologies. In the second section, the policy landscape that makes theresearch both timely and important is described. The low-voltage distribution network, as part of thepower system, is described in more detail in the third section. Individual technologies (distributed\u2013 1 \u20131.2.

An overview of the solution is provided in the fourth and fifth sections.The structure of this thesis is outlined in the final section of this chapter.1.2 Research BackgroundThe organisation of the system that delivers electricity from large-scale power plants to individual con-sumers is illustrated in Figure 1.1. The long-distance, high voltage (HV) (400kV to 132kV) transmissionsystem delivers power away from centres of power generation. Distribution refers to the part of thenetwork that delivers power from the transmission system to individual customers at voltages of 132kVand below. The low voltage (LV) section of the system is at the bottom of the diagram, between 230Vsingle-phase (or 400V 3-phase) and 1kV in the UK.Figure 1.1 shows all of the generation at the top of the diagram \u2014 conventionally, these are large\u2013 2 \u2013Chapter 1. Introductionthermal power stations: coal, gas or nuclear plants. However, smaller Distributed Generation (DG)(from a few hundred watts up to several MW) may be connected at the distribution level. These includebackup diesel generators, Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) incinerators, large biomass plants, individualwind turbines or farms, some gas turbines and, more recently, large solar photovoltaic (PV) farms. SmallScale Energy Generators (SSEGs) of under 100kW installed capacity (rooftop PV, micro-wind, smallbiomass and combined heat and power, see below) may be connected to LV distribution networks at230V/400V.The current paradigm for Low-Voltage Distribution Networks (LVDNs) is one of passive control,where networks are designed to operate continuously without monitoring or adjustment. In contrast,measurement, online analysis and control devices in active networks allow characteristics such as trans-former tap settings, equipment ratings or even network topology to be altered dynamically. This can beused as an alternative to network reinforcement or additional generation where capacity is reached; atthe planning stage to reduce required infrastructure; or to improve the economic or technical operationof existing equipment.Whilst active control techniques have gained acceptance in high-voltage transmission and distributionsystems, their implementation in LVDNs is less widespread and usually confined to specially-designedremote or island power systems or demonstration \u201cmicrogrids\u201d (see Section 2.2.3). Active control hasbeen increasingly viewed as a useful tool to solve network issues in distribution networks for some time:the UK DTI first recommended a move to active approaches in 2004[2]; since then some implementationhas followed but active control remains a significant research area: the results from the Low CarbonNetworks Fund projects included active techniques appropriate down to low-voltage networks, and the2016 HubNet analysis of these projects recommended Active Network Management (ANM) for all DGconnections[3].Widespread integration of DG, Electric Vehicle (EV) and other technologies into LVDNs poses severalchallenges. Combining these technologies with active control and demand-side management techniques(see Section 1.4.5) renders them into Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). DERs are resources at thedomestic level that can be used in managing the electric network as well as for their consumer purpose.The liberalised electricity system and the regulatory framework in the UK add non-technical facets tothe research landscape. The overall target for research is to propose and demonstrate the effectivenessof an active control approach at the LV level that can mitigate the technical issues to integration withinthe UK context.This work forms a continuation of research into control of DG in LVDNs undertaken by DurhamUniversity, focusing on increasing the environmental, commercial and technical benefits of small-scalegeneration in evolving distribution networks. It is supported and funded by EPSRC and E.ON.\u2013 3 \u20131.3. Regulatory Framework and Non-Technical Context1.3 Regulatory Framework and Non-Technical Context1.3.1 UK RegulationsThe UK electricity system is \u201cliberalised\u201d: that is, since the Electricity Act (1989)[4], it has been operatingas a mixture of competing and collaborating stakeholders. Generation plant, transmission networks anddistribution networks are owned and operated by separate legal entities, with electricity then retailed tocustomers by companies who compete on price by trading within wholesale energy futures and settlementmarkets.The 1989 Act was supplemented by the Energy Act (2008)[5], which added the Feed-In Tariff (FIT),and the Energy Act (2013) [6], which added a Capacity Market (CM) and Contracts for Difference (CfD),and these schemes run alongside the wholesale market[7]. Further details on these market structures andtheir implications are included in Section 1.3.3.Large energy companies may incorporate supply, distribution and retail roles as subsidiaries; thesevertically integrated organisations are regulated to ensure they operate as several competing, independentbusinesses.In the UK, the regulator is the Office of the Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM), which grantsregional monopoly licenses to network operators. It promotes competition and ensures that networkoperators adhere to the Distribution Code[8].In order to facilitate growth in distributed generation, Engineering Recommendation G83/1[9] was in-troduced as part of the Distribution Code. These guidelines for both users and operators of a distributionnetwork create simple, favourable conditions for owners of small generators. Currently, DG which out-puts at less than 16A per phase may be connected to existing LV networks following the \u201cfit-and-inform\u201dprinciple in which there is no centralised planning of how or where DG is connected by consumers. Theprocedure outlined in [9] specifies how a generator may be connected and describes limits on operat-ing conditions (e.g. mandatory disconnection after 1600ms of a low-voltage event) and a DistributionNetwork Operator (DNO) cannot refuse the connection without a good technical reason. Currently, theregulations do not permit small generators to be assessed as making any contribution to system security.1.3.2 The Broken Value ChainThe requirements of the multiple actors in the electricity network are quite different and sometimes inconflict: generation plant owners may be seeking revenue from an investment and hence maximise outputat all times; Combined Heat and Power (CHP) owners may only wish to export when there is a largelocal heat demand; a DNO may wish to limit loads or energy sources to protect equipment and ensurestable system operation; and a trader will wish to exploit patterns in electricity consumption to improve\u2013 4 \u2013Chapter 1. Introductiontheir market performance. Generation plant owners may be able to provide services to stakeholders notrepresented in the current market structure. A workshop in November 2010 involving the Department forEnergy and Climate Change, industry representatives and Durham Energy Institute described the lackof a clear and direct link as a barrier to the transition to a low carbon grid, summarising, \u201cIt is not clearwho the \u2018customer\u2019 is for smart grid technologies\u201d[10]. Even in 2016, a whitepaper by Policy Exchangelevelled significant criticisms at this disconnect. The policy thinktank directly called for simplification ofthe ancillary services markets, and commented,\u201cin order to further decarbonise the power system, it will need to become smarter and moreflexible.... Overall, it is clear that cleaner forms of flexibility such as demand response andstorage face a number of policy and regulatory barriers.\u201d[11]There is a continued \u201cbroken value chain\u201d between grid impacts, services, and stakeholders, which addscomplexity into any attempt to fully exploit the integration of DERs in the UK.1.3.3 Market DriversThe 2013 Energy Act added the Capacity Market (CM) and the Contract for Difference (CfD) to thewholesale market[6]. In a CM, \u2018firm\u2019 energy suppliers receive a payment for making energy available1.This allows a system that includes significant intermittent renewable energy: if intermittent sources donot deliver and there is a shortage of energy, the firm suppliers offered contracts through the CM arerequired to make up the shortfall. The CM payment is only for availability of generation\u2014 it does notpay for the energy supply itself.The CM is paired with Contracts for Difference. This incentivises intermittent generation by guaran-teeing a price for energy supplied. If the wholesale market energy price drops below the guaranteed \u2018strike\u2019price, the scheme tops up the payment; if if the market price is above the strike price, the generator mustpay back the difference. The contracts are awarded competitively as the strike price is determined bysealed-bid auction to determine true market prices. At the same time as reducing the risk in investmentin intermittent generation, the budget allocated for CfDs is allocated in order to keep costs within thebudget of the Levy Control Framework, a policy for managing government spending on renewables anddecarbonisation targets[12]. The strike price is adjusted by technology to reflect the differences in costof competing low-carbon generation.Onifade[7] offers insight into the effectiveness of the CM + CfD policy instrument for incentivisingthe uptake of renewables. However, these two support mechanisms apply mainly to larger facilities andbackup generators. At the small scale (and in particular at the domestic scale), the market driver is stillthe Feed-in Tariff for generation below 5MW in capacity.1In this case, the suppliers include conventional generators and also \u201cproven\u201d and \u201cunproven\u201d demand-side response;storage technologies; and interconnectors that can inject power into the UK grid.\u2013 5 \u20131.3.

Data from[14].After the passing of the 2008 Energy Act, Feed-In Tariffs (FITs) were implemented in March 2010[13].These guarantee a fixed electricity price to the owners of microgeneration technologies. The price iscomposed of two parts: the generation tariff subsidises generation whether the energy is used locally ornot; there is an additional export tariff payment if the electricity is exported to the grid. The generationtariff is dependent upon the type of technology.Initially, PV was more expensive to install and attracted a higher price than micro-Combined Heat andPower (\u00b5CHP); the generation rate for PV (43p/kWh) drove significant investment in new installations,at the same time as its capital costs reduced significantly. PV gave a rate of return in excess of manyconventional financial investments. As well as consumers claiming the subsidy, many companies startedto rent roofs (amongst other agreements) for installations. The feed-in tariff has been a significant driverto increasing microgeneration in the UK. As shown in Figure 1.2, the UK installed capacity is over 9GWin 2016, up from 0.015GW in 2010.However, the longer-term rate of PV uptake may reduce considerably in the due to changes in FITpolicy, in keeping with Onifade\u2019s observations on uncertainty caused by governmental changes in FITschemes[7]. The export tariff was recently cut to 4.91p/kWh for all technologies; the PV generationtariff dropped to 4.32p/kWh and the\u00b5CHP generation tariff was set to the comparatively higher rate of13.45p/kWh from April 2016[15]. Some uncertaintainty is reduced by the projection of tariff rates toMarch 2019.As of August 2016, National Grid has concluded a tendering process for new frequency responseservices[16]. These can be provided by large storage facilities, but also through demand response and\u2013 6 \u2013Chapter 1. Introductionaggregation. Whilst aggregators were able to bid in this process, none were successful in this round; inthe future, DERs may play a role in this market.In addition to the increasing cost of petrol creating market conditions for cost-effective EV use,UK government subsidies directly incentivise their uptake. More than 51,000 EVs were bought withgovernment support between up to December 2015[17]. The subsidy scheme has been extended to March2017, with support for EVs worth \u00a34500 per vehicle from March 2016[18].1.4 Low Voltage Distribution Networks1.4.1 Characteristics of LVDNsFigure 1.1 shows power flow from centralised generation through the transmission system to loads withinthe distribution system. The low voltage (LV) distribution system consists of the lower-voltage part ofthe network, taking power to individual customers connected at 230V/400V (single/three-phase).Household electrical power demand varies between users, depending upon precisely when particularappliances are used. However, the average demand can be assessed by taking an average across multiplehouseholds. Figure 1.3 shows this average demand profile for the UK over a 24-hour period.Figure 1.3: Daily demand profile of a houseThe diagram shows how the power demand of a UK household varies with time. The diagram illustratesa typical unrestricted (i.e. not Economy 7) customer, and is one of 8 domestic profiles used by suppliersto estimate demand. The data are averaged to show the after-diversity demand (in kW) over a 24-hourperiod in half-hourly intervals. Image from [19].The figure shows low demand during early morning hours, followed by an increase when people wake.There is a small peak around lunchtime, then another peak after 6pm, then the demand drops as peoplesleep. Demand is season-dependent. There is considerable variation in power use \u2014 demand on summer\u2013 7 \u20131.4. Low Voltage Distribution Networksnights may be less than a quarter of the winter peak.The demand profile is an average across many users and not all customers will be using appliancesin the same way at the same time; the coincidence curve in Figure 1.4 shows the decreasing ratio ofcumulative peak demand and the likely peak demand as the number of customers (and hence load di-versity) increases. This probabilistic method allows for specification of infrastructure that is below thecumulative load peak whilst remaining cost-effective. The exact shape of the demand and diversity curvesis determined by the profile of the users on a particular network segment.00.20.40.60.811 10 100 1,000 10,000 100,000Number of customersCioncidence factor Figure 1.4: Coincidence curveThe ratio of cumulative peak demand to probable peak demand reduces as the number of usersincreases[20].Conventional LV network planning takes into account growth in household use and number of cus-tomers on a feeder; however, many networks have been planned without taking into account the new,significant requirements for technologies such as microgeneration and electric cars, both of which willhave significant impacts on existing systems. These technologies and impacts are explored in Sections1.4.2-1.4.5 and in Chapter 2 in Section 2.2.1.1.4.2 Distributed Electricity GenerationThe role of small-scale DG has developed significantly over the past two decades. Diesel and gas generatorsand renewable technologies such as photovoltaic cells can be used to supplement a weak grid or provide areplacement for it in remote locations. DG has grown in importance as it is deployed for new reasons: aswell as having uses in securing reliability of supply and high quality power, it also forms part of the UKstrategy to provide low-carbon electricity using renewable energy sources and local CHP production. Thegeneration of electricity near its point of use reduces losses in transmission and distribution networks and\u2013 8 \u2013Chapter 1. Introductioncan provide cheaper energy than that bought from a supply company. Wind, CHP, biomass, anaerobicdigestion/gas turbine systems and photovoltaic generation are all connected at the distribution level. Inparticular, large wind turbines and farms can be connected to the distribution network if there is sufficientcapacity for the extra power. Wind turbines are connected across the complete range of voltage levels inthe distribution network, although micro-wind has not been extensively deployed at domestic voltages.The payback period (both economically and environmentally) for micro-wind is typically unfavourabledue to the combination of installation costs compared to capacity and poor wind characteristics in urbancontexts. Power system studies are required to assess the impacts of connecting larger DG, but low-powerDG is not examined in the same way and has the potential to be disruptive (see Section 1.3.1). PV and\u00b5CHP can be connected at low voltage at the household scale and have the potential to be deployedextensively.1.4.2.1 Combined Heat and PowerCombined Heat and Power (CHP) generation uses a thermal energy source (such as gas or biomass)to supply both electrical and heat demands, improving efficiency of power generation. In 2003, the UKDepartment for Trade and Industry (DTI) set out plans for 10GW of installed capacity of distributed CHPby 2010 [21], although by 2009 this had only resulted in a modest increase from 4.8GW to 5.5GW[22]. In2011, the government recommitted to increasing CHP capacity, saying: \u201cThe Government will continueto promote the development of good quality CHP in the UK\u201d[23]. It subsequently legislated for this tobe the policy and strategy under the Energy Act (2013)[6].The proportion of non-domestic small-scale CHP (of under 100kW electrical power) remains low,at only 454 installations constituting 28MW. Between 2011 and 2014, 477 \u00b5CHP units \u2014 below 2kWcapacity each, a total of less than 1MW \u2014 were installed in the domestic sector in the UK[24]. CHPuptake is driven by a combination of reduced energy costs and increased efficiency, with the impact ofreducing carbon emissions. There are market benefits since \u00b5CHP is included in the feed-in tariff schemedescribed in Section 1.3.2. The operation of CHP plant is typically driven by a local heat demand, sobenefits of increased efficiency are often dependent upon a coinciding electrical load.1.4.2.2 PhotovoltaicsPhotovoltaic (PV) panels can be fitted to roofs to supplement a building\u2019s energy needs. The use of PVhas expanded rapidly in the UK due to the introduction of FITs for generation and export (see Section1.3.2). Householders installing a new PV array are guaranteed a subsidy for any energy production.As well as for reducing electricity bills (and electricity-related CO2 emissions), consumers and others areusing PV arrays as stable investments. FITs have resulted in the formation of companies willing to buy orrent roof space for PV arrays in order to take advantage of the profitable subsidies. Figure 1.2 shows the\u2013 9 \u20131.4. Low Voltage Distribution Networksrecent rapid increase in UK PV capacity. Sustained growth of this magnitude will require interventionsto ensure safe electrical network operation; the implications of this are discussed in more detail in Section2.2.1.Daylight hours \u2014 and the power output of PV \u2014 may not match consumer use patterns, particularlyin cases where a PV array is fitted to a house where its occupants are absent during the day. Arrays maybe oversized for a building in order to take advantage of the FIT incentive, so there may be a considerableproportion of energy exported. In addition to the challenges associated with more predictable distributedgeneration, the electricity network must tolerate the intermittent nature of solar energy which can resultin power flow swings and harmonic distortion.1.4.3 Electric VehiclesThe transport sector produces 22% of UK annual greenhouse gas emissions[25] and road transport is thelargest component of this. Personal transport in petrol/diesel cars forms the majority of fuel consumptionand is a major target for decarbonisation. A move away from combustion engines to EVs and Plug-inHybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) has been part of the UK low carbon strategy since 2009[26]. Thisincludes government subsidies and investment in infrastructure. EVs need to be combined with a low-carbon electricity supply in order to have a beneficial impact on CO2 emissions. The additional generatingcapacity required for this transition (including personal transport and light goods vehicles) could be ashigh as 40GW by 2050[25].EVs could have a role as active network components, rather than just passively consuming electricityuntil fully charged. Their batteries can be used as energy storage devices for supporting network opera-tion. This approach where a car battery supplies energy, called Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), allows aggregationof large numbers of vehicles to provide ancillary services, for example, for frequency or voltage supportby supplying stored energy during periods of insufficient generation. This can help the integration ofintermittent renewable sources[27]. In this case, market-driven or specifically tailored pricing structurescould result in a vehicle charge controller buying electricity at cheap rates and selling it again at peaktimes, informally known as \u201ccarbitrage\u201d. At present, there is a lack of clear structure for settlement withvehicle owners. Consumers may be reluctant to participate where this may reduce their utility of havinga car available on demand or at the cost of battery life reduction.However, until these issues are addressed, they remain useful in other ways: they can be used tosmooth electricity demand profiles by adjusting charging power or delaying or advancing charging cyclesover time. Aside from the 40GW+ increase in the generation required to power large numbers of electriccars, the classic network problem is one of capacity and use patterns: a large number of users return totheir homes after work and plug in their cars to charge, creating a large number of high loads that drawpower for a long time. As the literature in Section 2.2.1 will demonstrate, with extensive EV use, the\u2013 10 \u2013Chapter 1. Introductioncombination of reduced diversity from typical load patterns and the large current draw for these deviceswill be sufficient to overload the existing infrastructure[1]; these network issues are discussed in moredetail in Section 2.2.1.1.4.4 Heat PumpsHeat pumps are important to the decarbonisation of energy for space and Domestic Hot Water (DHW)heating. The Coefficient of Performance (CoP) of a heat pump determines the efficiency with whichenergy from an external source is converted to useful heat. The UK Energy Mix is described in [28],but including transmission and distribution losses the average UK grid carbon intensity was around367gCO2/kWh in 2015. [29]. Consequently, a Heat Pump (HP) with a CoP of around 3 produces heat at122gCO2/kWh, which is comparable to efficient condensing gas boilers; as the UK energy mix becomesgreener, this comparison will only become more favourable. This makes it a low-carbon technology eligiblefor the Renewable Heat Incentive, a government subsidy scheme.Similarly to EVs, a HP is a large load with a long cycle. The network impacts are consequently similarin terms of thermal overloading and voltage drop. Consequently, electrical network reinforcement willbe required[30] if HPs are to contribute significantly to the UK\u2019s decarbonisation efforts. However, theelectrification of heating provides opportunities for Demand-Side Management (DSM). Existing staticTime of Use (ToU) tariffs encourage owners of immersion heaters and electric space heating to chargeovernight. However, models have shown that thermal storage (for space heating or via a tank for DHW)can allow staggered startup to mitigate the effects of large loads operating simultaneously and delaynetwork reinforcement (see [31]). The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM)-funded Customer-Led Network Revolution (CLNR) project[32] has demonstrated HPs with thermal storage in large fieldtrials with successful load-shifting for voltage support.1.4.5 Demand-Side ManagementDemand-Side Management (DSM) encompasses a range of techniques in network operation that altercustomer use of a system, rather than assets owned by a network operator. This comprises both technicaland behavioural interventions: for example, a DNO may send a signal to a customer instructing anappliance to switch off (demand response), or electricity pricing structures may discourage system use atparticular times of day. As well as instructing or incentivising the use of customer loads in a way that isbeneficial to the network, microgeneration may also be regarded as \u201cdemand-side\u201d for control purposes;small generators are modelled as a negative load on the customer\u2019s side of the network.1.4.5.1 Benefits of DSMOFGEM calculated that capability to load-shift 10% of UK customer electricity would avoid capitalcosts of \u00a3536million for new generation and \u00a328million for network reinforcement annually[33], as well\u2013 11 \u20131.4. Low Voltage Distribution Networksas reducing wholesale electricity costs. Strbac [20] outlines the advantages of adoption of DSM as:\u0088 Reduction in generating capacity margin.Generation capacity in the region of 20% above peak consumption is regarded as sufficient headroomfor system security. However, the cost of plant for capacity margin purposes may be \u00a3250-\u00a3400/kWor more; DSM may provide a more cost-effective alternative to standby generation.\u0088 Improving effectiveness and economic efficiency of distribution networks.Figure 1.5 shows the intended network impacts of DSM for load shaping, where DSM techniquespostpone or advance electricity consumption. Improved load profiles benefit a DNO through delayednetwork reinforcement, lower equipment ratings and reduced distribution losses. In addition toincreasing average utilisation of assets, DSM can be used in outage management and for powerquality improvements. Whilst Strbac mentions improved electrical efficiency and carbon reduction,DSM does not itself significantly reduce electricity use; Shaw et al. demonstrated that load-shiftingis likely to reduce consumption by 0.02% since a flatter load profile has lower overall I2R losses[35].This is not significant compared to other system losses, leading to the conclusion that DSM is ofhigher value for peak reduction, rather than directly improving network efficiency. Shaw drawsno conclusions about the value of matching local demand and generation for reducing distributionsystem losses, but Strbac notes that the potential 25-40% reduction in distribution network lossesfrom widespread use of \u00b5CHP is dependent upon matching generation with peak load[36].\u0088 Balancing supply and demand, particularly in systems with intermittent renewable energy sources.The installation of DG diversifies supply as well as demand, and increases the complexity of systembalancing. As well as reducing demand when generation is not available, the use of DSM has evolvedto include carbon considerations. Matching demand to renewable power production can improveFigure 1.5: Load-shaping impacts of demand-side management. Each sub-graph shows a load peak anda new shape that can result from DSM. Figure reproduced from [34].\u2013 12 \u2013Chapter 1. Introductioncarbon efficiency; time-shifting of a load so intermittent supply can replace conventional fossilgeneration significantly reduces per-MW CO2 emissions. DSM can be used to increase flexibility,such that intermittent sources are more fully exploited when available (including heat-demand-driven CHP as well as weather-dependent wind power), and less energy is consumed at other times.A direct benefit of this is that unfirm connections to the distribution network (i.e. where generatorsmay be required to curtail output due to network conditions such as low demand or high production)can use DSM to reduce \u201cspillage\u201d of excess power.\u0088 Improving efficiency of investment in transmission infrastructure.Currently, transmission assets typically only operate at 50% of capacity in order to accommodatethe headroom required by demand peaks. As is the case with distribution, these peaks can bereduced through DSM, allowing a higher average utilisation.It should be noted that DSM may have significant drawbacks, such as reducing load diversity. Load-shifting concentrates use into shorter time slots, so the proportion of devices in use at any one timeincreases after DSM interventions.Customer engagement is vital to the effectiveness of DSM schemes, from acceptance of direct controlof customer devices through to encouraging and maintaining behavioural change through market factors.OFGEM notes that its predicted scenario of increased use of electric heating (of space and water) andelectric cars is highly compatible with DSM techniques[33].1.5 ConclusionThe sections above describe the power systems domain, and the new technologies that must be integratedinto the low voltage (LV) electricity network. The introduction of widespread distributed generation isbeing driven by concerns over energy security, climate change, and commercial considerations of costs andprofits. These factors are also drivers towards Heat Pump (HP), Electric Vehicle (EV) and Demand-SideManagement (DSM) adoption. These technologies will create problems and opportunities where networklimits begin to impose constraints. Previous researchers have examined the impact of distributed gener-ation on LV networks and developed control approaches to mitigate these effects for network operators.The proceeding chapters show that these issues have not been solved in their entirety and illustrate thesignificant open research problem.1.6 Solution OverviewIn this work, the importance and impact of location in LVDNs are examined with respect to the challengesof integration described above. New techniques are developed that can be used to identify the location of\u2013 13 \u20131.7. Structure of this Documentdevices within electrical networks. The use of decentralised multi-agent systems in control applicationsis explored. The following new contributions are made to the field of distribution network control:1. New electrical network models, data and tools.2. New work in describing and identifying location.3. Design of a novel, decentralised Multi-Agent System (MAS) incorporating new MAS techniques.4. Design and build of a novel test rig to validate a location-based MAS approach for control.5. Implementation and validation of a location-aware MAS control system for a voltage support task.A case is built for location-aware systems through modelling the electrical network topology includingthe new technologies described above. New techniques are provided to detect or infer location by exploringthe links between electrical topology and network theory and non-electrical forms of location. Themulti-stakeholder context of the problem necessitates new multi-agent approaches, which are examinedand exploited beyond the current state of the art. Finally, the argument for such a location-aware,decentralised MAS control system is tested and validated through implementation on a new test rig thatincorporates real-time, online hardware-in-the-loop control with a dynamic electrical network simulation.1.7 Structure of this Document\u0088 The electricity distribution system is introduced in Chapter 1 and the context given for the workundertaken.\u0088 In Chapter 2, the literature is reviewed on the integration of distributed generation and othertechnologies, control techniques, and coordination approaches, with a focus on multi-agent systems.This review is used to clarify the research problem. Conclusions are drawn for the ideal propertiesof a proposed new solution.\u0088 In Chapter 3, electrical network theory is provided to explain the principles behind the researchproblem and to examine electrical aspects of location. Existing benchmarks are used to developnew electrical network models and create tools for examining, solving and testing solutions.\u0088 Chapter 4 contains new work that develops ideas of location in electrical networks. New techniquesare presented using geographical and electrical information to describe and derive network topologyin a key step towards a location-aware system.\u0088 The problem is examined in the context of the Multi-Agent System paradigm in Section 5.1. Agenttheory is used to develop a decentralised approach, including the new concept of Intention Transfer,for a novel control system.\u2013 14 \u2013Chapter 1. Introduction\u0088 The implementation of the new Multi-Agent System is described in Section 5.2. Proof-of-conceptsystems were used to demonstrate initial application of the various location and MAS componentsbefore development of a new test rig to allow on-line, real-time, hardware-in-the-loop testing of thesystem. This system incorporates the electrical and geographical aspects of location from Chapter4, and operates on an electrical network described in Chapter 3.\u0088 Results of the application of the control system using the real-time test facility are presented inSection 5.3; the new test facility is evaluated and the solution assessed in terms of the researchproblem statement.\u0088 Finally, Chapter 6 contains a summary of the work, including discussion of its significance andwider context and the direction of future research in the field is outlined.\u2013 15 \u20131.7. Structure of this Document\u2013 16 \u2013Chapter 2Literature ReviewThis chapter examines integration of small-scale generation, electric vehicles and other new technologiesinto electrical distribution networks. By examining existing literature in this area, it introduces the con-cepts of Microgrids and the Small-Scale Energy Zone. It identifies how multi-agent system programmingapproaches can be used for coordination and control of LVDNs as well as highlighting existing examplesof this approach. Finally, it uses this review of the state of LV network control technology to outline asignificant and original research problem.2.1 Low-Voltage Distribution Networks2.1.1 Legacy LVDNsAs outlined in Section 1.2, distribution refers to the part of the network below 132kV and the LV sectionis at 230V single-phase (or 400V 3-phase) to 11kV. In the UK, the electricity system is composed ofdistribution networks that are connected by high-voltage transmission infrastructure.The UK power network has been growing since the commissioning of the first modern three-phasedistribution system attached to Neptune Bank Power Station in 1901. The longevity of power systemscomponents was anticipated; according to the network planning literature of the 1980s in the UK,\u201cThe various items of equipment installed in power systems have long useful lives with someitems remaining in service for 40 or 50 years. Thus, proposals... should not just cover presentloads but be capable of meeting or being reinforced to meet future loads\u201d [37].Certainly, this has been borne out by experience \u2014 for example, as of 2012, the distribution networkserving London and the South East still includes thousands of power transformers commissioned in the1950-1960s and even earlier. Whilst the equipment lifespan may still support continued operation, the60-year-old assumptions around network use and growth from initial installation are no longer appropri-\u2013 17 \u20132.1. Low-Voltage Distribution Networksate. Whilst still allowing for future growth, \u201cplans to meet future demands are generally based on theassumption that load patterns will not change significantly\u201d[37]. With the recent and significant uptakeof HPs, EVs and PV generation (as outlined in Sections 1.4 and 1.3.2), the growth models are out of date.Not only this, but the customer load profiles used to analyse the maximum power demand in design areno longer representative of realistic customer use patterns incorporating these technologies, due to thedifferent characteristics of these new load (and generation) types in terms of magnitude, duration andtime of use.The long-term nature of electrical network planning for long-lasting assets means that as the electricalnetwork changes significantly and rapidly in the coming years, there is a need to integrate DER into thesesections of network that have existed \u2014 and will continue to exist \u2014 for decades. Consequently, as wellas updated planning techniques for the future, there is a need for tools to allow these new technologiesto fit within these legacy networks.2.1.2 Properties of LVDNsThe characteristics of the LV segment are dependent upon a number of properties of the infrastructure(such as topology, transformer ratings and conductor types) as well as customer use patterns. Conse-quently, network characteristics vary widely with geographies of settlements and housing density, usertypes and environmental considerations.LV networks can be designed in a way that reduces transformer requirements, improves security ofsupply and reduces cost. Possible topological arrangements are shown in Figure 2.1. The topology has aneffect on the power flows through the system and the voltage profile along the wires. Various topologiesmay be in use at different points in the distribution network, but at the customer end open loops (withnormally-open points depicted, Figure 2.1(d)), and the radial arrangement (Figure 2.1(e)) are common.In rural settings, long radial networks connected with overhead cables are the norm. In dense urbansettings, underground cables are used. The urban LV network is predominantly still radial, but withsome normally-open points: these switches isolate two halves of a loop under normal operation, but canbe closed to connect them, particularly to facilitate maintenance[38] or to electrify part of the networkwhere a conductor has been lost.Less power is transferred over the conductors at the distribution level; the cost of thicker conductors(with lower resistance) is compared with the value of the power losses. The consequence is that inLVDNs, thinner conductors are used. In contrast to the transmission network, the resistance of thewires is significant compared to the inductance. Unlike in the transmission network, resistance cannotbe neglected to simplify network analysis.The supply voltage is divided between the feeder resistance and the load applied. Resistance isdependent upon conductor length. A longer conductor increases resistance; loading of the feeder increases\u2013 18 \u2013Chapter 2.

Normally-open points are shown and may be closed to connect loops.the current through the conductor. Since V = IR, there is a voltage drop across the conductor thatincreases with distance along the radial feeder and with feeder load. There is a difference betweenthe nominal supply voltage and the actual voltage at customer equipment: the voltage drop across theconductor means that voltage at the remote (i.e. customer) end decreases with distance and load. UKlaw specifies that the voltage for the customer must not drop by more than 6% or rise by more than10% of the nominal supply voltage[39]; equipment is designed to operate safely within this range, anddeviation beyond it may cause damage. Consequently, the system must be designed to supply customerswith power that remains within acceptable voltage limits.The supply to individual domestic customers is typically single-phase. When customer loading pat-terns are not equally distributed across three phases, there will be some phase unbalance present in the\u2013 19 \u20132.2. Distributed Energy Resourcesnetwork, which must be kept within acceptable limits. The Unbalance Factor can be calculated usingthe definition provided in [40]; the maximum permitted unbalance is 1.3% in the UK.2.1.3 Current DER Integration ParadigmAs described under the regulatory framework in 1.3.1, currently, DG which outputs at less than 16A perphase may be connected to existing LV networks following the \u201cfit-and-inform\u201d principle in which thereis no centralised planning of how or where DG is connected by consumers. Heat pumps and EVs do notrequire any such notification. The technical aspects of integration beyond this notification process andthe state of the art in operating networks incorporating DER are detailed in Section 2.2.2.2 Distributed Energy Resources2.2.1 Impacts of DERsThe connection of DERs in distribution networks challenges many of the expectations regarding networkproperties in Section 2.1.2. In particular, the direction of power flow (usually from HV to LV), thevoltage profile (decreasing along a radial feeder with distance from the transformer) and phase balance(with significant clustering effects) can no longer be assumed at any given point.The impacts of DER have been explored extensively in the literature on DER integration. Theseinclude:Voltage rise and dropAttaching generators to the network causes the local voltage to rise. At a certain level, the voltagebecomes unacceptably high. Similarly, for large loads such as HPs and EVs, the voltage reduces asthe network becomes more heavily loaded.StabilityPower electronic interfaces used to invert the supply from DG do not provide system inertia likeconventional rotating machines; a higher proportion of power supply from SSEG reduces systemstability.Net power exportIn conventional systems, the generator voltage is transformed up to the transmission level, thenpower flows down through successively lower voltage levels, from top to bottom as per Figure 1.1.With generation embedded in the distribution system, power may flow in the opposite direction toreach other loads if it is not consumed locally, with some currents reversed from the original design.Existing protection systems are not configured for these reverse power flows.\u2013 20 \u2013Chapter 2. Literature ReviewUnintentional islandingAn entirely self-supplied system may become islanded and continue to operate separately fromthe grid. The frequency will deviate from the remainder of the grid, causing stability issues forreconnection; frequency and phase must be rematched to avoid large transient currents and systemoscillations. Safety is compromised: any on-line generators may still cause the system to be live,even if the grid supply is disconnected upstream in a way usually sufficient to ensure isolation.Maintenance may be difficult, as generators may need to be isolated individually.Thermal overloadingIncreased current from additional loading, reverse power flows and from phase unbalance causesincreased heating of power systems components; care must be taken to ensure this does not exceedthe existing design parameters.Fault levelThe inclusion of DER may change the current flows in the case of fault. This may render protectiondevices unable to detect faults, or increase the current that may be supplied past equipment ratings.UnbalanceClustering effects may occur where customers on the same phase acquire DERs in groups in a waythat does not fit balanced load growth projections. The resulting voltage unbalance has a significanteffect on phase current.Loss of diversitySimilar items of equipment, and in particular with long duty cycles, reduce the coincidence factor(see Section 1.4) used to plan networks. The value of maximum power consumption per customeris sensitive to the duration of equipment use.Harmonic injectionPower electronics that invert the supply from DG for grid connection superimpose harmonics onthe Alternating Current (AC) network. These, and any Direct Current (DC) component, reducepower quality, increase losses and may damage other equipment.Network lossesGeneration local to consumption may reduce energy losses through reducing the distance over whichpower is distributed. However, when more energy is produced than locally consumed, losses areincreased, particularly when SSEG operates at non-unity power factor. High-current loads (EVs,HPs) will increase I2R losses.\u2013 21 \u20132.2. Distributed Energy ResourcesThe work by Trichakis[1] built on the impacts analysis by Lyons[41] to create a methodology topredict the maximum permissible volume of microgeneration on a given LV network without technicalintervention. This was then expanded to include EVs[42]. The impact on voltage rise and regulation,phase unbalance, cable and transformer limits was dependent upon network configuration, necessitatingan impact study on a per-substation basis \u2014 for example, despite the wider EU constraints on phaseunbalance (%Voltage Unbalance Factor (VUF) of 2% versus 1.3% in the UK), the EU generic case studycould only tolerate around half the asymmetrical SSEG volume compared to the UK generic network.Whilst the impacts are configuration-specific, at times Trichakis argues that constraints on maximumSSEG volume within the UK system would vary by level, but not by the order in which they are encoun-tered \u2014 although the results actually presented show some re-ordering of this list. In order of decreasingsignificance, these are: a) voltage unbalance (if SSEG is significantly clustered on a single phase); b) volt-age rise; c) transformer thermal limits; d) voltage regulation; e) cable thermal limits; and f) networklosses. Under the EU regulatory regime, however, voltage regulation and thermal overloading were moresignificant. These results informed their approach to create a control system targeted at voltage andthermal limits.The impacts of EVs are primarily thermal overloading of transformers and voltage drop, with phaseunbalance, cable ratings and harmonics not normally realistic problems. The threshold for network issuesoccurs where more than a third of customers use EVs[42], though Putrus et al. estimate it to be evenlower[43].A number of researchers have attempted similar research to analyse the impact of large amounts ofDERs. Table 2.1 shows a summary of DER integration limits, extending the photovoltaics limits surveyby Whitaker[44] to include EVs for comparable recent context1. These limits are for cases where nocontrol or coordination is used. The table shows initial conservatism to maximum levels - 5% for PV and10% for EVs in early stages of use, with increasing confidence closer to the present day- but still withvoltage limits issues. Despite the increase in the maximum over time as understanding of impacts hasimproved, each of the authors places an upper limit, and it is clear that there is room for integration ofPV to be facilitated and expanded through the use of active control techniques.Approaches to improving integration of DER into distribution networks were explored in \u201cTechniquesfor DER integration and active networks management\u201d as part of the EU-wide SOLID-DER project[48].The do-nothing approach may be valid for very low numbers of DER and in the short-term, but beyondmonitoring (such as through G83 notification), the use of active control at the device and distributionnetwork level is necessary.Even after SOLID-DER, considerable obstacles remain in integration of DER. The 2014 review article1Papdopoulos et al. also evaluate pre-2012 EV integration literature[45]. These studies align with the themes of thermaloverloading and voltage drop, but also consider the acceptability of increased losses in distribution networks.\u2013 22 \u2013Chapter 2.

Distributed Energy Resourcesby Olivares et al.[49] enumerates some of the outstanding issues, which still include \u201cdevelopment ofnew voltage and frequency control techniques to account for the increase in power-electronics-interfaceddistributed generation\u201d, and in particular \u201ccontrol mechanisms that exhibit a plug-and-play feature toallow for seamless integration over time\u201d. In spite of approaches taken thus far in the literature towardssolving these issues, there is still a need for methods that do not require extensive o\ufb04ine configuration,setup or maintenance to effectively lower barriers to entry for DER. The cost of both technology andeffort in commissioning make plug-and-play functionality of particular importance.A market approach is common in attempting to solve these constraints, such as the MAS EV chargingcurrent/voltage limits method presented in Weckx et al. [50].2.2.2 Relevance of LocationMuch of the literature discusses the importance of device location. The resistive nature of the LV networkmeans that the power loss and voltage profile is dependent upon distance from the transformer. Voltagedrop becomes a significant issue when a device is connected by a long line; rural connections in particularare vulnerable to voltage issues. Location can also refer to phase: nearby domestic customers may beconnected to each other such that clustering effects become significant[42]. Alternatively, they may be onseparate phases and consequently a customer experiencing power quality problems and voltage drop mayderive no benefit from DG only a few metres away. Limits on the number of SSEG that may be installedin a passive network (due to the G83/1 system outlined in 1.3.1, for example) may not take account ofa connection next to a transformer having a minimal effect on voltage and consequently unfairly limitaccess to the benefits of SSEG ownership and slow implementation of low-carbon technologies.2.2.3 Active Approaches to DER IntegrationDevelopment of active approaches have continued well after SOLID-DER concluded. More recently, DNOsin the UK examined the integration of DER across distribution network scales in projects supported bythe Low Carbon Networks Fund (LCNF); several operators undertook research in this field, and ratherthan network reinforcement, these projects analysed Smart Grid approaches to the issue. The HubNetconsortium (see Section 2.2.5.1) summarised the outputs of the LCNF projects between 2009-2015[3]. Itcategorised the research effort into the following:\u0088 Innovations for Network Operation\u2013 Storage\u2013 Flexible Demand\u2013 Generator Control\u2013 Network Configuration\u2013 Equipment for Active Regulation of Voltage\u0088 Innovations for Network Visibility and Design\u2013 24 \u2013Chapter 2. Literature Review\u2013 Real Time Thermal Ratings\u2013 Enhanced Network Monitoring\u2013 Enhanced Network Visualisation\u2013 Enhanced Understanding of Existing Demand\u2013 Enhanced Understanding of Low Carbon Technologys (LCTs)Much of the research was aimed at the 11kV and above (especially for real-time thermal ratings andfor large battery storage), but some of the work examined residential LCTs (i.e. small-scale DG, heatpumps and EVs). The analysis recommended new research into:\u201cthe geographical nature of flexible demand requirement\u201d.This HubNet summary analysed the combined efforts of UK distribution network operators\u2019 progress inDER integration through the LCNF over more than 5 years with over \u00a3500m of research, and highlightsa significant need for further work on small-scale DER integration with a focus on geographical aspects.One of the key projects focused on residential LCTs was the Customer Led Network Revolution(CLNR)[32]. As part of CLNR, the approach in [51] outlines how a cluster of energy storage and demand-side response equipment could be used for voltage support, integrating customer equipment as essentialnetwork components. In comparison to approaches such as this that engage with DERs, some otherprojects within the cluster such as Customer Load Active System Services (CLASS)[52] examined activesubstation components to adjust voltage levels in order to improve network performance but withoutany integration with customer devices themselves. In the same paradigm, the network itself can bereconfigured, rather than adjusting DERs, such as in the system described by Capitanescu et al. whereactive network normally-open points can be used to dynamically adjust medium voltage (MV) networktopology when required to assist in DG integration[53].The move from simple active components to smart grids has developed significantly over time, andthrough a number of concepts and architectures.Distributed Generation may be included in small, specially designed LV grids, which may or may notbe islanded (isolated from a larger grid), with diverse generation technologies supplying a correspondingload. Whilst small grids were being designed and implemented earlier, Lasseter outlined the Microgridin 2001 [54] and then formalised the concept in 2002 [55], identified its component parts and described abasic control mechanism.In a Microgrid, a mix of sources and loads are controlled to provide power and achieve goals ofreliability, efficiency and voltage regulation; to operate as a single dispatchable entity; and managed tofunction as either a grid-connected or islanded system. Consequently, it is of great relevance in the field ofDER integration, as each item of equipment can be managed for both consumer function and for networksupport. Each element on the network can function autonomously: in its most basic form, each source\u2013 25 \u20132.2. Distributed Energy Resourceshas a controller that examines its local conditions and determines an appropriate operating point, butcoordination across the system is also possible. Haziargyriou reviews the state of research efforts intoMicrogrids in [56] and also enumerates many demonstration projects worldwide.The Small Scale Energy Zone (SSEZ) complements the Microgrid concept. Widespread DG, EVs andother technologies are incorporated over time into existing parts of the electricity distribution networkwithout central planning by a DNO and then grouped together with a common control approach toform an active grid[57]. Whilst Microgrids and SSEZs are similar, their development is quite different;Microgrids are carefully designed to ensure correct network operation and matching of generation andloading after analysis of a particular scenario, whereas SSEZs grow organically and upon legacy systemsas consumers and other stakeholders install new equipment.The Smart Grid concept combines information technologies and control at and across any level in theelectrical system. At the customer end, concerning integration of DG and EVs, it is thus highly relatedto Microgrids and SSEZs. Microgrids and SSEZs \u2014 as de facto Smart Grids \u2014 form a significant partof research activities into intelligent, active energy networks for DER integration.2.2.4 SSEZ ApproachesLyons described the SSEZ[41] and went on to create a physical model, creating the Durham ExperimentalSmall Scale Energy Zone (ExSSEZ), shown in Fig. 2.2, and diagrammatically in Fig. 2.3, which wereused for investigation of centralised control approaches[58].Figure 2.2: Photograph of Durham Experimental Small-Scale Energy Zone facility\u2013 26 \u2013Chapter 2.

Cipciganexamined how many smaller generators could be coordinated using these SSEZs to provide a larger \u2014and potentially more useful \u2014 dispatchable entity, with the benefit of offering ancillary services (such asvoltage support \u2014 see [59]) as a Virtual Power Plant[60].The control solution used by Trichakis has various advantages due to the strengths of the MASparadigm. The properties and advantages of a MAS in this type of task are discussed in Section 2.3.2.3.However, the decentralised system actually implemented in [1] suffers from a fundamental problem: thecontrol system relies on centralised information. A solution that removes this would be a considerableimprovement.Whilst covering the same research area, references to SSEZs have declined over time: more recently, theterm \u201cmicrogrid\u201d has expanded from its original definition to include active approaches to grid-connectedlegacy networks.2.2.5 Microgrid ApproachesMicrogrid control, both in standalone operation and in grid-connected mode, has been the subject ofextensive investigation. The \u201cTrends in Microgrid Control\u201d review[49] covers literature concerning DERintegration as well as issues around control hierarchy, centralisation and decentralisation, markets, DERtechnologies and progress made in particular control techniques to date. The importance of the move toSmart Grids and the role of microgrids has resulted in the availability of international strategic researchfunding. Some of the larger research projects \u2014 and their relevance to this work \u2014 are outlined below.\u2013 27 \u20132.2. Distributed Energy Resources2.2.5.1 UK ResearchIn the UK, major research in this field is funded by esearch Councils UK), primarily through Engineeringand Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).HubNet is an RCUK (Research Councils UK) - funded consortium between seven universities withinthe SUPERGEN (SUstainable PowER GENeration, supply, transmission and storage) initiative withinthe RCUK Energy Programme, and is one of seven other energy hubs. Some of those other hubs are rele-vant here: SUPERGEN-HiDEF (formerly SUPERGEN-HDPS) uses the \u201ccell\u201d concept in its approach \u2014this is similar technically to the SSEZ, but explicitly recognises roles of consumers, generators, regulators,network operators and other stakeholders as microcosms of existing electricity networks. SUPERGEN-FLEXNET has examined distributed voltage control through the use of power factor control[61]. However,the HubNet remit specifically includes smart grid infrastructure for electricity networks. It has been op-erating since 2011 and received follow-on funding in 2016. It cascades funding to projects within its remitand in particular has dedicated funding to distributed control.The HubNet consortium has contributed significantly in this area, with over 117 publications to date.Two are book chapters, 63 are conference papers, and 53 are journal articles; 22 of these journal articlesare on Smart Grids themselves (as opposed to, for example, power electronics or mega-grid technology),of which only one is on the topic of active control: in this approach, refrigerators are used for frequencycontrol by adjusting demand[62]. The authors demonstrate that a random element is required to preventovershoot from too many devices synchronising2.Of the remaining non-journal publications, the conference articles and consortium position papers arehighly indicative of the state of the art. Its 2016 review[63] highlighted some research gaps by drawingon the literature and examining the state of current systems and regulatory frameworks.A distributed agent-based multi-energy-vector control system was proposed by Arnold et al.[64]. Theydecomposed the energy systems into hubs which represent \u201cthe interface between the energy sourcesand transmission lines on the one hand and the power consumers on the other hand\u201d. These hubscould represent large demands or geographical areas. The distributed optimisation problem was solvediteratively. Control agents were associated with these hubs, with each agent responsible for its own(potentially geographical) sphere of control.Whilst this still does not solve issues of predetermined control areas or iterative communication withlarge numbers of agents, this study in particular informed the approach of the consortium in tacklingintegrated energy systems, including decentralisation, and formed part of their research gap analysis [63]for future work.2The issues of synchronisation were addressed for the voltage control problem solution in this thesis by using geographicaldistance to create sufficient disorder without compromising response.\u2013 28 \u2013Chapter 2. Literature ReviewConsequently, agent approaches have been used for modelling and control and in particular, formarket-based control systems. Some work has examined whether there is benefit in using smart controllersat the distribution level for demand response[65] and demonstrated the effects of using DR in a specificcommunity for control applications. Then, in applying agent-based approaches, Karangelos and Buffarduse a learning agent-based controller to determine a consumer\u2019s participation in a demand responsescheme[66]. Whilst this contributes to enabling more DER integration through allowing consumers toparticipate in the market, this approach makes no attempt to account for the distribution networkoperational constraints, and implementation of markets remains outside the scope of this work.Even in 2014, the HubNet consortium still considered voltage control in the network and at thedomestic meter to be an open issue[67]. However, the consortium identifies that smart technology in thedomestic setting can play a role in achieving control.Smart grid approaches for transformer equipment in LVDNs have examined the use of smart metersfor state estimation[68]; however, in this case the state estimation relied on the power consumption beingsimilar to the sum of all of the metered power usage plus some losses. This is not appropriate wheresmart meters are not fully deployed, or where there are unmetered users (e.g. for street lighting). Thereis significant progress yet to be made in leveraging information at the smart meter level in networkoperation.The consortium will continue to operate until at least 2018. The Top-And-Tail consortium concludedin 2015 having examined the \u201clast mile\u201d of LVDNs and included examination of voltage regulation, butdid not publish on active, agent-based control at this level. The latest HubNet Symposium included the\u201cDistributed Intelligence for Network Operation and Control\u201d theme, but as of the latest 2016 meeting,and despite the Integrated Energy Systems and the Distribution System Operations position papers[63,67] showing the need for research in this area, LVDN operation (including voltage control and using theirpreferred agent-based approach) is still only examined in terms of markets, small numbers of agents andpredetermined network topologies[69]. Overall, this indicates the research gap is still significant in termsof UK efforts in this area.2.2.5.2 EU ResearchAfter releasing a 10-year policy and strategy for sustainable energy in 2010[70], the European Unionset out a timeline for a transition to low-carbon energy supply through the European Strategic EnergyTechnology Plan (SET-Plan). Alongside other topics, it includes the European Electricity Grid Initiative(EEGI)[71], which provides funding for smart grids research including demonstration facilities. DERintegration is a theme under its research programme. As well as these European Industry Initiativeswithin the SET-Plan, other funding is available through a number of mechanisms. Currently, the Euro-pean Commission supports large, international projects through the Horizon2020 research and innovation\u2013 29 \u20132.2. Distributed Energy Resourcesprogramme, to run 2014-2020. The Societal Challenges pillar includes Secure, Clean and Efficient Energyas a theme which incorporates Smart Grids. A great deal of work in microgrids was included in the thenow-concluded Framework Programmes FP5-FP7, where active distribution network technology existedas research theme since cycle FP5.Since then, considerable progress has been made. IRED[72] was a cluster of large-scale projects fromFP5 and FP6 for improving distribution networks and integrating renewable energy sources. Table 2.2lists the relevant projects and their abstracts, which are discussed below.Table 2.2: Highlighted EU research projects within the IRED clusterProject Date AbstractMicrogrids [73] 01/2003 -12/2005To investigate, develop and demonstrate the operation, control,protection, safety and telecommunication infrastructure of Micro-Grids and determine and quantify their economic benefits.More Microgrids[74]01/2006 -12/2009To increase of penetration of microgeneration in electrical net-works through the exploitation and extension of the Microgridsconcept, involving the investigation of alternative microgeneratorcontrol strategies and alternative network designs, development ofnew tools for multi-microgrids management operation and stan-dardisation of technical and commercial protocols.DISPOWER [75] 01/2002 -12/2005\u201cDistributed Generation with High Penetration of Renewable En-ergy Sources\u201d \u2014 To help to prepare the safe, reliable and highquality implementation of distributed generation into Europeangrids focussing on the efficient integration of renewable energysources.DER-lab [76] 11/2005 -presentTo support the sustainable integration of renewable energy sources(RES) and distributed energy resources (DER) in the electricitysupply by developing common requirements, quality criteria, aswell as proposing test and certification procedures concerning con-nection, safety, operation and communication of DER-componentsand systems. A major objective is to establish a durable EuropeanDER-Lab Network that will be a world player in this field.FENIX [77] 01/2007 -12/2009To boost DER (Distributed Energy Resources) by maximizingtheir contribution to the electric power system, through aggrega-tion into Large Scale Virtual Power Plants (LSVPP) and decen-tralized management.SOLID-DER [78] 11/2005 -10/2008To tackle the barriers for further integration of DER, overcom-ing the lack of awareness and fragmentation in EU R&D resultsby consolidating all European DER research activities; to raiseawareness of DER solutions and benefits in the new EU MemberStates, thereby addressing the specific issues and barriers facedhere.Whilst some of the projects focus on large-scale DG and transmission networks, others focus onintegration of small generators. Microgrids[73] examined implementation of independent low-voltagegrids, examining safety, communications, islanded operation and control and markets. Much of theliterature in this field now uses the hierarchies and nomenclature set up in this project. It culminatedin two key papers: one on multi-agent methods for microgrid control[79], and one presented at CIGREsummarising large-scale integration of DER through microgrids using a market-based centrally-controlled\u2013 30 \u2013Chapter 2. Literature Reviewsystem[80].More Microgrids[74] was the logical extension to the project and investigated issues of widespreaddeployment[81], such as standardisation, evolving distribution management structures and control strate-gies, particularly in terms of (de)centralisation. A strictly hierarchical system, such as the zone-profit-maximizing customer-cost-minimising central controller[82], utilised market bids from microgenerators.However, load-shedding for frequency response was devolved, where agents each established a ranked listof shedding responsibilies to determine operation (see Section 2.3.2.3). Field trials were of this systemwere conducted on a system implemented on the Greek island of Kythnos[83].In another market-based approach, FENIX [77] used the Virtual Power Plant (VPP) as a vision forfuture power grids with extensive DG. It delivered a centrally-dispatchable VPP, used for the day-aheadmarket, 15-minute-ahead reserves and voltage control through setting reactive power at the SSEG[84].Functionality was separated into the technical VPP, and the commercial VPP, examining market inte-gration whilst facilitating system balancing functions for a system operator[85] by characterisation of azone as a single entity.DISPOWER[75] developed inverter technologies for grid integration, examining the problems of gridsynchronisation, load balancing and limiting power output to prevent overloading. It also examinedvoltage rise mitigation in LV networks using load control (DSM). Voltage and real - reactive powerwere measured at strategic network points by a central controller. The central controller instructedcustomer loads to switch on to adjust demand via a radio communications link, reducing generationconstraining and voltage rise[86]. In addition, the centralised load control system could be used toachieve the operational goal of zero (instantaneous) power export to the grid.In particular, DER-lab[76], as a strategic institution facilitating standardisation for distributed en-ergy resource technologies, outlived its sister projects. Through a network of European laboratories, itcoordinated and implemented significant international collaborative studies.With the IRED cluster concluded, EU funding continued to analyse DER integration through an-other 14 projects (INTEGRAL, IS-POWER, ADINE, CRISTAL, VSYNC, GROW-DERS, DESIRE,RELIANCE, CEERES, EU-DEEP, ADDRESS, MIRABEL, W2E and G4V) in the area in FP6-7. Afull list of these projects and their abstracts is in Appendix A.1. Some were more targeted towardsmicrogrids, decentralised and agent-based approaches; supporting ICT infrastructure research was alsoincluded. This infrastructure was recognised as a key requirement to support wide microgrid adoption,but now remains an open problem: Web to Energy (W2E)[87] was interested in the standardisation ofcommunications infrastructure and data management as an enabling technology for smart grids, predom-inantly by extending existing control architectures. Aggregation of SSEG was included in its projectobjectives in including communication down to consumers at the metering level. IEC61850[88] is a com-\u2013 31 \u20132.2. Distributed Energy Resourcesmunication standard intended for substation automation and its use in DER management and householdappliance control was never anticipated, however, W2E examined extending IEC61850 for DSM, andprovided an implementation of the standard for a VPP application by providing additional hardwarebetween non-IEC61850 smart grid equipment (meters and sensors) and the control system[89]. The useof IEC61850 in DER integration has also been carried forward beyond W2E. A proof-of-concept DCmicrogrid controlled using this standard was developed in [90]. Later, some of the criticisms regardingthe need for plug-and-play functionality were addressed in May 2015 when an adaptive architecture formicrogrids using IEC61850 was proposed[91]. There are still barriers to its uptake in this configurationin the UK: the multi-stakeholder system means a microgrid controller hierarchy is inappropriate, and ina peer-to-peer agent-based configuration, IEC61850 is incompatible with the use of FIPA-SL (see Section5.2.2.4 on MAS standards).However, the main focus remained upon control strategies in distribution networks. In particular, ofthose 14 above, particularly relevant projects were INTEGRAL, ADDRESS and MIRABEL (formerlyMIRACLE).The INTEGRAL project sought to provide a model for the creation of an active network for DERintegration. A major outcome was a framework for these active networks, divided into a series of issuesand requirements: operationally, this would include normal, critital, and emergency operation modes,and approached via an aggregation approach[92]. Most of the solution requirements (scaleable, open,multi-actor, market-aligned) are echoed in Section 2.5. One aspect examined decentralised operationapproaches for the three modes, although the final output of the project in this area only went as far asdescribing models and facilities for testing self-healing cells (through a microgrid approach) [93], ratherthan analysing decentralisation itself.MIRABEL[94] (formerly MIRACLE ) used market-based coordination methods[95] for demand-supplybalancing. It used Experimental Microgrid at Centre for Renewable Energy Sources and Saving (CRES),and applied the VPP-like technology to create low-emissions zones through optimising energy sourceson a carbon basis with a trial in Germany. The MIRABEL concept uses micro-requests for energy: adevice will specify its energy requirement and how much flexibility (in terms of time-shifting) it hasfor this demand, and defines a way to describe flexibility[96]. The MIRABEL Energy Data ManagementSystem (EDMS) was devised in order to perform aggregation of these micro-requests at centralised tradernodes[97]. The project successfully demonstrated balancing for energy supply and demand, taking intoaccount optimising for the availability of renewable energy, and optimising for price. This fits well withthe energy trading structure in the UK: the demand and aggregator nodes map to consumers and theirretailers. However, whilst the system accommodates the needs of a transmission operator for balancingpurposes, the network constraints of the distribution network operator are not directly addressed in\u2013 32 \u2013Chapter 2. Literature Reviewthis approach[96] particularly where there may be geographical clustering effects from the aggregationprocess.ADDRESS also approached DER integration through aggregation. Under the ADDRESS TechnicalConceptual Architecture, each DER is operated via an Aggregator, and those Aggregators trade onmarkets for 24 discrete services, participating in a similar way to larger DG or conventional generationoperators, retailers and traders[98]. Significantly, it highlights a need for a local intelligent service at thelow-voltage susbstation that provides real-time topological knowledge of the network[99] although theproject published no implemented solution for this. Intelligent solutions for network topology would fitthe knowledge gap identified here.Now the Framework Programme has concluded, microgrids and DER integration research continuesthrough the Horizon2020 EU funding programme. The Low Carbon Energy research strand includes\u201cLCE-02-2016 - Demonstration of smart grid, storage and system integration technologies with increasingshare of renewables: distribution system\u201d. P2P-SmarTest will examine peer-to-peer (P2P) operation forintegration of demand side flexibility (i.e. provision of ancillary services through DER)[100]; GOFLEX(Generalized Operational FLEXibility for Integrating Renewables in the Distribution Grid), startingin November 2016, will look at advanced aggregation and VPPs[101], alongside several other H2020projects in the area. GOGLEX and P2P-SmartTest are included also in AppendixA.1). These will,however, primarily focus on market participation of small-scale DER operators. Both projects makeexplicit reference to enabling energy storage and the use of flexibility for distribution network operationand the use of agent and microgrid approaches, but are in their early phases.The continuation of this significant funding stream underlines the importance of the microgrid paradigmin addressing issues of DERs in LVDNs. In particular, voltage control remains an open problem at lowvoltage[67]. With no current single, unified solution, it appears that microgrid and agent-based ap-proaches seem likely to continue to be of interest to the European community for some time, and thiswork will provide a contribution in this space.2.2.5.3 US ResearchThe US research into microgrids is not coordinated in a comparable fashion or scale to the EU pro-grammes. The United States Department of Energy funds research programmes into distributed genera-tion, primarily through the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability. The California EnergyCommission also commissions significant research into new and renewable technologies. Both of theseorganisations have been instrumental in the Consortium for Electric Reliability Technology Solutions(CERTS); this has contributed work in Microgrid research as a means to integrate DG. A major resourcefor this research is a full-scale distribution network facility comprising load and generation equipment upto a 13kV grid connection point[102]. The control approach is centralised, with \u201cplug-and-play\u201d capabil-\u2013 33 \u20132.2. Distributed Energy Resourcesities as equipment is connected or removed. Microgrid disturbance response is achieved in millisecondsby autonomous local control, and a central Energy Manager individually dispatches microsources with atimescale of minutes, for either grid-connected or islanded operation. This corresponds with the conclu-sions reached by the EU research[103] that real-time centralised dispatching is inappropriate.Subsequent to the Hatziargyriou review article[56] mentioned in Section 2.2.3, an energy bill in the USestablished \u201cSmart Grids\u201d research as a federal priority[104]. It created a task force to promote the use ofdigital information systems for control of the electric grid to improve reliability, security and efficiency. Inparticular, it provides for \u201cDeployment and integration of distributed resources and generation, includingrenewable resources; [and] development and incorporation of demand response, demand-side resources,and energy-efficiency resources.\u201d Research in these areas has expanded rapidly, bolstered by economicstimulus funding into energy programmes.Market participation is a common theme throughout research programmes[105]. Little explicit ref-erence is made to agent-based control systems, although descriptions of control system functionality(communication, autonomy, learning capabilities) are common to the MAS approach.2.2.5.4 Rest of WorldWhilst the EU and US perform the majority of research into DER integration through large and collabo-rative initiatives, the challenges are still faced by other countries with a large uptake of DG. In Australia,the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) collaborates with other in-ternational research groups in multi-agent coordination of microgrids. In Japan, the New Energy andIndustrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) is a government body that has been involvedin several microgrid projects including distribution network research for integration of very high levelsof PV in existing networks[106], with a physical installation of 553 arrays in a single urban area; here,studies focused on how to avoid constraining generation to maximise energy yield. Private researchersparticularly from Japanese technology companies have also examined microgrids comprising single build-ings, and some cases to the scale of manufacturing sites; however, details of the research, methods andresults are not publicly available for these corporate R&D programmes.A number of international collaborations have been particularly significant in microgrids development,such as the \u00bf5million, 2014-2017 collaboration between Aalborg University, Tsinghua University, Kam-strup and the Shanghai Solar Energy Science & Technology Company on \u201cMulti-energy ComplementaryMicro-grid Technology Research\u201d. Aalborg University has a microgrid research and demonstrator facil-ity for AC and DC networks[107] in the Department of Energy Technology. Guerrero and the PowerElectronic Systems group have published extensively on microgrid control and power electronics.Much of the work published by this group considers islanded microgrids and DC microgrids, and thecontrol strategies are predominantly hierarchical \u2014 such as in \u201cControl Strategies for Islanded Micro-\u2013 34 \u2013Chapter 2. Literature Reviewgrid using Enhances Hierarchical Control Structure with Multiple Current-Loop Damping Schemes\u201d[108]\u2014 and is consequently not appropriate for the UK domestic context. The group has also used GPStechnology in microgrid operation, albeit for its timing properties rather than geographical location, incommon with many other power systems applications of GPS. In [109] the authors propose control ofan islanded microgrid using GPS for synchronising timing for frequency management without requiringcommunications links.However, some of the group\u2019s work is highly relevant on decentralisation and multi-agent systems formicrogrid control. In 2016, the authors proposed in \u201cAgent-Based Decentralized Control Method forIslanded Microgrids\u201d[110] that a microgrid should be modelled as comprising an electrical network (withan electrical topology), with a control network (of a multi-agent system with associated communicationtopology) overlaid. This two-layer approach was then used to derive control laws for the island microgrid.Whilst identical topology for the electrical grid and communication network were used, the derivationcould operate over a system where these two layers were asymmetric - albeit requiring complete informa-tion about the system in the control law planning stage. Further details of the group\u2019s work in multi-agentsystems and decentralisation are discussed in Section 2.3.2.3.2.2.6 Using Location in IntegrationSome of the systems for DER integration use location in their solution (for example, Trichakis and Lyonsin 2.2.4 or AGORA in 2.3.2.3). However, this review has only found existing work where network data isalready known. In the context of attempts to decentralise the control system, then, there are no knownsolutions that use location or network data that is not provided centrally.Some techniques have been devised to develop dynamic information about the network. For a faultdetection system in the power systems domain, in He and Zhang[111], distributed measurements are usedin conjunction with network topology information in order to add properties to a graph of transmissionnetwork nodes for the purpose of identifying the geographical location of network faults. Messaging is usedto communicate local estimates of the graph properties through the network which are then reconstructedinto an improved estimate of the global system. They coined the term decentralised network inference todescribe this process. Again, however, this approach requires the network connections data in advance.A decentralised network inference method to derive topology information for distribution networks wouldobviate configuration effort.Using a database of known electrical network information is problematic; data may be commerciallysensitive or protected for security purposes. Coordination of multiple system operators is necessary, sincethe UK system is divided into regional monopolies. Data may not exist to a relevant detail level in alllocations. Perhaps more significantly, such a database must be maintained and updated regularly. Theability of a controller to learn its network location without needing or building a full model of the entire\u2013 35 \u20132.3. Multi-Agent Systems in Power Systemssystem can avoid some of these problems.2.3 Multi-Agent Systems in Power Systems2.3.1 Applications OverviewSpecific properties of agents are often highlighted within power systems applications: for example, socialability (communication, negotiation) is exploited for the coordination and aggregation of DERs into aVPP[112]. Ability to act autonomously improves agent-based transmission system secondary voltagecontrol in both response time and reliability by removing total reliance on a single central controller,particularly in fault cases[113]. Whilst expanding the use of markets within power systems is sometimesperceived as an aim in itself, it can be a useful tool in solving other problems, such as in the market-basedEV charge controllers for transformer current and voltage limits outlined in [50]. The participation ofagents within markets is covered extensively in the literature both within and without the power systemsdomain.Multi-agent techniques can be applied at all levels of power systems, from HV transmission networksdown to individual appliances in houses or even aboard ships[114]. As well as applications in protection,network monitoring, and simulation, distributed control is a focus for MAS research[115]. In particular,the multi-agent system approach allows for development of a control system that takes into accountthe various stakeholders whilst maintaining the functional independence of all of its components. As aminimum, the following topics (including those in Sections 1.4 and 2.2) have all been addressed usingagent functionality:\u0088 thermal overloading of transformers\u0088 voltage rise and drop\u0088 voltage regulation\u0088 voltage unbalance\u0088 cable thermal limits\u0088 frequency control\u0088 islanding\u0088 enabling DSM\u0088 market participation\u0088 maintenance planning\u0088 topology reconfiguration.The wide exploitation of specific and combined attributes of agents in these applications demonstratesthat the multi-agent system approach has considerable merit in this field.\u2013 36 \u2013Chapter 2. Literature Review2.3.2 Decentralisation2.3.2.1 Problems of CentralisationIn the liberalised electricity system described in Section 1.3.1, multiple stakeholders have different andsometimes conflicting control requirements. As a result, there is a lack of a clear control hierarchy for theresolution of network issues. The electricity market participants are not responsible for reliable networkoperation and the network operators are not responsible for operational decisions of generation equipmentowners.Centralised control has limitations including single points of failure and communication bottlenecks,as well as issues with system maintenance and scalability as components are added under G83/1. Thereis a lack of clear hierarchy since components are owned by different, self-interested entities. Marketderegulation is recognised as a driver towards cooperation-based, distributed control[116] since there isnot always a clear path from the entity responsible for a control goal to the entity responsible for itsimplementation. A decentralised approach can avoid hierarchy issues and is highly effective for localcontrol, allowing local controllers to assume responsibility. However, more effort and coordination isrequired when dealing with adjusting or optimising global conditions. Studies in artificial intelligencehave shown that combining markets with decentralised local controllers can yield a globally-effectivesystem[117], and this result has clearly informed some approaches to microgrid control[103]. However,in the absence of an effective market (see Section 1.3.1) or even a clear definition of its participants,an alternative method of achieving global control through decentralisation is necessary. The advantagesof decentralised control specifically outlined in [118] are a) scalability and openness; b) reliability andresilience; and c) communication efficiency, strongly suggesting that an LV control system should followthis approach.2.3.2.2 ScalabilityScalability must be a basic facet of any system for distribution network control, so mechanisms for coordi-nating an appropriate multi-agent system must be suitable for large numbers of agents. The effectivenessof a group of agents in solving a problem reaches an (application-specific) threshold, above which theadditional of more agents to a task impedes its solution[119], due to some resource constraint (such ascommunications bandwidth or physical space). Subsets of the agents can form ad-hoc teams for coopera-tion, removing the need to involve the entire agent society. A \u201cdynamic, partial centralisation\u201d[120] cancreate (temporary) teams and hierarchies for sub-problem or conflict resolution, providing a scalable anddistributed approach. It can also accommodate the need to degrade gracefully with component failure bymonitoring effectiveness and assigning new teams. The probability of some agent failing increases withagent society size and number of interactions, so a robust solution becomes increasingly important with\u2013 37 \u20132.3. Multi-Agent Systems in Power Systemslarger systems, providing more weight to the arguments for a distributed solution.2.3.2.3 Existing Approaches to DecentralisationCommunications can be used to improve microgrid operation, but are not essential in implementingdistributed control techniques. The Distributed Fuzzy Load Controller[121] examines frequency in anislanded microgrid \u2014 a global property \u2014 to determine under/over-utilisation of microgeneration. Eachload controller then autonomously calculates whether corrective action is necessary. The system incor-porates a random element in the controller logic such that actions are fairly distributed between themover time.One devolution example in the \u201cMore Microgrids\u201d Kythnos project used a low-priority load-sheddingDSM technique[83], triggered by low frequency. The central controller informs load agents of the total loadto be shed. The loads announce their own consumption, and they all establish a ranked list of the others.Loads that were shed in the previous cycle are placed at the bottom of the list. An agent determines fromits own position in the list whether or not it will shed load, and messages the central controller accordingly.If the sum of the shed loads is below the requirement, the central controller initiates another sheddingcycle. Decentralisation in the Kythnos microgrid[103] refers to load or source controllers independentlydetermining set-points based on bidding and negotiation through a central power market under normaloperation: whilst agents retain autonomy of action, the system is still subject to the constraints of asingle, central zone controller. Other examples of devolved control include the system to coordinate unitdecommitment for maintenance described in [116].Trichakis went some way to distributing control[1], but used a global database of measurement data,rather than giving each control agent a unique knowledge base. Reliance on global knowledge reducesan agent\u2019s ability to take action based on local knowledge. It also means that if an agent is unable toupdate a remote database for any reason, others will then act on incorrect information. Finally, theinformation representation method included network location data (phase location and a node referencenumber) which requires agent configuration and creates model maintenance issues as nodes are moved orchanged, so the advantages of a plug-and-play system are not realised.In existing power systems, power export from a zone may be limited by protection devices configuredfor unidirectional power flows, or by equipment ratings. Multi-agent systems are used to achieve opera-tional goals of zero power export or as a coordinated exporting entity, so can be used to ensure these limitsare not breached. Equipment upgrades could alleviate these limits but require reconfiguration of micro-grid controllers. Consequently, there is a need to develop a system that allows for a changing electricalnetwork. Static, human-configured, network-dependent designs are clearly inappropriate for the organic,unplanned SSEZ context. Unlike the configurations in [122] or [85], where the network constraints aredetermined at design by a DNO and included in a single centralised microgrid controller, the use of\u2013 38 \u2013Chapter 2. Literature Reviewmultiple Thermal Limits Agents (TLAs) in the scheme proposed by Trichakis [1] is highly suited to thispurpose: a TLA sends commands to direct control agents (at loads or generators) when its local statusindicates an alert or emergency state. Any number of constraint agents may be created, each takingeffect at different system operating points. This implementation has considerable drawbacks, however.Firstly, the TLA is not located at the measurement equipment, but rather hosted at a DNO-operatedfacility with a global measurements database. Secondly, relevant agents or equipment are determinedat the design stage and hard-coded into the system; no dynamic mechanism is proposed. Any form ofchange to load or generation would require considerable reconfiguration effort, effectively negating thepositive aspects of scaling plug-and-play agents that impose independent network constraints. Someform of dynamic network characterisation, team generation or fuller decentralisation could improve thisapproach considerably.One fully-decentralised, non-hierarchical control system is the \u201cAEN\u201d[123], an autonomous microgridfor integrating DG, enhanced by inter-device communication. The system comprises primary, secondaryand tertiary control levels, which correspond with the priority of control goals in the distribution net-work. Primary control allows for operation even in the absence of communication in response to frequencyand voltage and as a fail-safe. Secondary control then looks at voltages system-wide for power qualityimprovement. Finally, tertiary control performs economic optimisation. The lower two levels are decen-tralised by using a form of distributed averaging achieved through gossip communication. This entailsrepeated peer-to-peer interactions where agents exchange information and adjust their control set pointsaccordingly, by \u201ctrading\u201d small power output increments to keep total output constant. The economicoptimum to be reached is the minimization of total cost of production. However, in the UK, the marketis not complete: all power produced is purchased by the consumer at a fixed rate regardless of the costof production. Since the objective of feed-in tariffs is to stimulate uptake of more expensive renewabletechnologies, it makes little sense to impose control based on economic efficiency. DSM is modelled asnegative generation that will produce zero power when the unit cost reaches the correct incentive thresh-old. The binary nature of some loads is not appropriate for a proportional-integral control block forsecondary control, and the discontinuity in the cost function is incompatible with the tertiary optimisa-tion method; gossip-coordinated incremental power output change is not always possible. The frameworkfor inter-device communication, AGORA[124], uses an overlay communications network such that de-vices on the same electrical network are strongly connected, with a gossip-step every three seconds. Theexperimental results show secondary and tertiary control response times of the order of tens of seconds.Whilst bandwidth and latency are unlikely to be an issue, this negates the benefits described above of fastresponse to avoid disconnection under G83/1. Most significantly, however, is that the power reliabilitycontrol subsystem takes no account of network constraints such as transformer thermal limits, relying\u2013 39 \u20132.3. Multi-Agent Systems in Power Systemssolely on voltage and frequency measurements to determine safe system operation.The AGORA [124] system notes the importance of electrical network location of DERs in its controlsystem. It uses location in order to determine connections between devices. However, it provides nomechanism for doing so: the information must still either be provided centrally, or derived somehow.A notable collaboration between the US Department of Energy and CSIRO has resulted in a testfacility employing GridAgents, a MAS with a central market and aggregation (like the VPP approach)where agents use a bulletin-board for exchanging information[125]. System planning algorithms of interestassume predetermined fixed groups of agents; researchers intend to examine algorithms for the formationof these planning groups including a topological approach similar to the overlay network of the AENdescribed above.In [126], the authors describe a voltage control system in LV networks at 6kV. It uses power flowmeasurements to control Static Voltage Regulator (SVR) Static VAR Compensator (SVC) equipmentwhere PV generation and EV use may cause large voltage fluctuations. The system combines centralisedoptimisation with resilience in the case where communications networks are unavailable. The systemperforms centralised optimisation which determines operating points and a model supplied to each con-trol device for measurements across the system. When the communications network is unavailable, thecontrol device uses its local measurements as inputs to the model, assuming a static load, to provide anapproximation of the optimum with an error based on the deviation between the static load assumptionand actual load. The model uses a local measurement of P and Q to extrapolate to the global state.Whilst a central server is required to set up the initial models, the local node uses its own model toestimate the state of the surrounding network for voltage control in a decentralised mode.In \u201cDroop-free Distributed Control for AC Microgrids\u201d[127], the authors propose a system that pro-vides cooperative multi-agent control. Significantly, even in 2016 the authors highlight the need forscalability, modularity, plug-and-play capability, and the need for the system to avoid the use of priorknowledge. The solution provides for sparsely-connected agents, each of which operates according tothree layers to control voltage, reactive and real power at each node - and to account for exchange ingrid-connected mode. The plug-and-play system also resolves where one of the DG units is removed andits agent goes off-line. The decentralisation is achieved via cooperation in communicating the reactivepower supplied by each unit; each agent compares its set-point with those of its neighbours each time-stepand adjusts itself in order to share the burden of network operational requirements for frequency andvoltage. However, there is a significant move away from the decentralised approach for tertiary controlas soon as stochastic sources (i.e. intermittent renewable generation) are included, and the system usesa single centralised tertiary controller these set-points and to allow power exchange in grid-connectedoperation. Whilst a single microgrid in this configuration would have plug-and-play functionality, the\u2013 40 \u2013Chapter 2. Literature Reviewboundaries of each microgrid zone would need defining and a framework for establishing the (redundant)connectivity between the agents.Each of these systems contributes in the area of DER integration, but in each case some significantaspects are missing. The next sections use the existing work to clarify the gaps in the literature that areyet to be fully developed and describe a solution that advances current methods of DER integration.2.4 Research Problem StatementThe literature survey in the previous sections outlined research into DG integration and illustrated someof the attempts made thus far in addressing the concomitant LV network problems. Several systems havebeen designed to limit voltage rise and to address thermal overloading as part of a priority-based list ofnetwork control requirements. Some implementations incorporate DSM schemes for consumer loads andother equipment. Decentralisation of control and the absence of agent hierarchy can be used to increasethe value of a system by lowering the barriers to its implementation: no maintenance of central controllersis needed; agents should require neither pre-programming with network topologies, nor design-time in-structions about which controllers should cooperate. Some acknowledgement is made of the need fortopology information, such as the intelligent real-time topology service specified in ADDRESS2011, (dis-cussed in Section 2.2.5.2), but provided no implementation. Progress has been made in decentralisation,such as the gossip-based AEN (see Section 2.3.2.3), but there remains no system that simultaneously ad-dresses the major technical problems of DG integration into a market-free, demand-driven legacy networkcontext whilst also capturing the full benefits of a multi-agent solution.Consequently, a scalable, network-independent, decentralised control system for operation of an evolv-ing network with multiple system constraints remains an open research problem.2.5 Problem Solution RequirementsDrawing on the survey of relevant literature, the idealised multi-agent-based control system to solve thisproblem would have the following characteristics:1. Decentralised controlThe system should self-coordinate without the use of a central controller. Any aggregation mustbe distributed.2. Multi-goalThe system should allow for multiple and conflicting network constraints and control objectives.It should address the problems of voltage rise and thermal overloading as primary barriers to DGintegration. Network constraints must be imposed dynamically to allow for these to change overtime. The system must allow for the multi-stakeholder context of the liberalised electricity system.\u2013 41 \u20132.6. Summary3. Market-independentSystem coordination must be achieved without the use of supply or ancillary service markets.4. Towards \u201czero\u201d configurationThe system should be capable of adapting to changing network equipment, topologies and par-ticipants, whether these occur regularly or perhaps once in the 40-year lifetime of a system. Itmust avoid the need for a DNO to initialize and maintain a controlled zone with electrical networkconfiguration data. Control agents should require a minimum of setup to participate in the system.5. ScalableThe system should be capable of scaling from a few participants in grid-connected SSEZs up to alarge number of agents connected across the distribution network.6. ResilientThe system should be able to tolerate failures of equipment, software and communications in agraceful fashion.7. Standards-compliantThe system must implement standard communication techniques in order to facilitate open access.There is currently no system described in the literature that fulfills these criteria. A system with thesecombined characteristics constitutes a significant and original contribution in the field of DG integrationand LV network control.2.6 SummaryThe uptake of DG, EV and DSM technology poses problems for the legacy installations of traditional,passive-controlled networks. Smart grids will not replace these in the short term, so a managed evolutionto integrated networks is required. Decentralisation appears to be a very appropriate way to achievethis goal. Multi-agent systems provide a framework to solve a distributed control problem. Whilstsome ground in this area has been covered, there are significant gaps in implementing such a system.Attempts by Trichakis and Lyons (see Section 2.2.4) have issues around the actual decentralisation byusing prior knowledge of the network and a centralised storage system. Attempts using location (such asAGORA in Section 2.3.2.3) also suffer from the need to start with a network map. Other solutions maysuccesfully demonstrate forms of fully decentralised control but do not take into account device location,which is important for several network operational goals. Consequently, there is a need to explore fullydecentralised control for DER integration that uses location without requiring a centralised database ofknown network data.\u2013 42 \u2013Chapter 2. Literature ReviewIn conclusion, the solution to the research problem outlined in Section 2.4 would be a considerabledevelopment in the field of LV network control. This thesis will contribute new work in distributed networkinference and voltage control using a multi-agent approach to fulfil these requirements and advance thestate of the art of DER integration.\u2013 43 \u20132.6. Summary\u2013 44 \u2013Chapter 3Electrical Network ModellingThe electrical theory basis for understanding and modelling electrical networks is outlined in this chapter.Existing benchmark LV electrical networks are reviewed and used to create new models of legacy distri-bution networks incorporating widespread DER. These models were implemented using several softwarepackages to provide electrical data and tools for the control solution presented in Chapter 5, as well asto illustrate the effects of DER in LV networks with a focus on the impact of device location.3.1 Electrical NetworksIn this section, the basic electrical principles are outlined for some of the phenomena caused by DERsin LVDN. The properties of appropriate models of these networks are discussed. The techniques usedin extracting relevant results are presented, along with a discussion of software packages used to analysecomplex networks.3.1.1 Basic Network Theory3.1.1.1 Voltage DropThe electrical network delivers power to customer appliances through wires that have resistance andinductance, and this resistive property is relevant to the voltage supplied to the customer. It is thisvoltage that must be kept within the regulatory limits of no more than 6% drop or 10% rise of thenominal supply voltage[39]. The customer voltage depends upon both the properties of the distributionline and the size of customer load applied, as will be shown below.3.1.1.1.1 Line impedanceTo illustrate the voltage drop problem, a simple model is shown in Figure 3.1 showing a single loadconnected to an electrical generator. Resistor Rd and inductor Ld at the top of the diagram combine to\u2013 45 \u20133.1.

This represents a single phase distributionnetwork for an AC system where a sinusoidal current i flows with peak magnitude I. The voltage dropacross a resistor is given in Equation 3.1. An inductor opposes a change in current; the back ElectromotiveForce (EMF) produced across it is given in Equation 3.2vr = iR = I sin\u03c9t (3.1)vl = Ldidt= L\u03c9I cos\u03c9t (3.2)where \u03c9 = 2pif for grid frequency f and i = I sin\u03c9t. Note that the current lags the voltage by 90\u00b0.A sinusoidal waveform can be projected onto a rotating vector in the complex plane, such as thevoltage shown in Figure 3.2. Power system currents and voltages can be represented as vectors thatrotate at the same rate: the angle between them is constant.v = V sin (\u03c9t)RotationVoltageTimeV=Vej\u03c9t\u03c9tReImFigure 3.2: Rotating vectorThe reactance is given by X = \u03c9L, and the impedance is the vector sum of the resistance and reactanceto give the complex vector Z = R+ jX, where j is the unit vector along the imaginary axis of the phasordiagram. By the generalised form of Ohm\u2019s Law, potential difference is the product of the current and\u2013 46 \u2013Chapter 3. Electrical Network Modellingimpedance vectors, V = IZ.In a distribution line, the ratio of line resistance to reactance is high, i.e. R \u001d X. Because of this,the small angle approximation is made: that is, the angle between the current and the voltage at boththe source and the customer is approximately the same.The current flows through the line to the customer load. This creates a voltage divider: the sourcevoltage vs is applied across the line and the load, with a potential difference across each. Then, usingthe small angle approximation, the voltage drop across the line is given by:|Vd| = IR cos\u03c6+ IX sin\u03c6 (3.3)3.1.1.1.2 Customer loadingThe total impedance in series in Figure 3.1 is Z + ZC (i.e. line + customer), and the current id iscommon to both resistances. Decreasing ZC increases current through the cable, reducing the proportionof voltage dropped across the customer load and hence increasing the voltage drop across the distributionline.Rd LdVsidAdditionalLoadRSaLSaRCaLCaRSbLSbRCbLCbRd\u2019 Ld\u2019RextraLextraCustomer \u2018A\u2019 branchCustomer \u2018B\u2019 branchFigure 3.3: Electrical Network: two customers, extra loadingA two-customer model showing distribution lines, service cables and customer load.

An expanded two-customer model is shown in Figure 3.3. By application of Kirchoff\u2019sCurrent Law, the current through the distribution line id must equal the sum of the current through the\u2013 47 \u20133.1. Electrical Networksbranches A and B.Suppose that customer \u2018A\u2019 switches on some additional load. It is added as a parallel branch.Theadditional parallel load has the effect of reducing the equivalent impedance of the \u2018A\u2019 branch. Similarly,the equivalent impedance of \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 combined is reduced. Since the total impedance of line and loadsin the circuit is decreased, the overall current id will increase.The higher current causes an increased voltage drop across Zd. The proportion of supply voltageapplied across the customer loads is thus lower. With the \u2018B\u2019 branch unchanged, the voltage experiencedby Customer B is reduced. Increased loading thus causes voltage drop locally and for other customers.For the general case, in Figure 3.4, customers are connected at nodes along multiple distribution linesegments, with indices d1...dn.

Additional loading increases current through each upstream distribution linesegment. For all customers, the effect of voltage drop caused by a customer load is increased with theelectrical distance (i.e. resistance) from the source.3.1.1.2 Analysis by Symmetric ComponentsThe modelling above assumes a single-phase system for simplicity. The distribution network usuallydelivers single-phase power supplies to residential customers, with some exceptions for users with veryhigh consumption. Figure 3.5 shows a three-phase system, with single-phase customer loads attachedbetween one phase and a neutral point. The neutral point is common to the other phases.The customer supply voltage waveforms are sine waves, with frequency f . In a balanced three-phase\u2013 48 \u2013Chapter 3.

Similarly to Figure 3.2, by the application of Euler\u2019s formula, ej\u03b8 = cos \u03b8+ j sin \u03b8, the sine waves canbe projected onto real-imaginary axes, shown on the right, as vectors that rotate with angular velocity\u03c9 = 2pif . Since the vectors rotate at the same rate, the plane may rotate to allow them to be consideredas stationary phasors. In the balanced case, the resultant of adding the symmetric, equal-magnitudevoltage phasors together is zero.A B CPhasorrotationVoltageTimeABC\u03c9tPhaseFigure 3.6: 3-phase to vector projectionThe three sine waves (left) show the voltages of three network phases over time.

Rotation of the vectors plots a circle, shown with a dotted line.The voltage changes with time can be projected onto the vector diagram: dashed lines show a snapshotat an instant in time. As time t increases, the vectors on the right rotate in concert through angle \u03c9t.\u2013 49 \u20133.1. Electrical NetworksIn networks where residential customers are connected to single phases, large numbers of customers aredistributed across the three phases such that the average demand across each is the same. However, at theLV end of the network, the diverse customer loads (i.e. impedances) attached to a particular feeder maynot match perfectly at a given instant in time. Consequently, the current and voltage phasor magnitudeswill not be the same and the phase shifts will vary. The result is that the sum of the phasors is not zero.Systems where the impedances do not match are unbalanced. The general case of an unbalanced, 4-wirenetwork can be drawn and labelled as shown in Figure 3.7.SOURCEPhaseAVng ZnnVlcZda VanVcnZdb ZdcZbnZbbVlb ZbbVla ZaaZab   Zac  Zan, etcIlcIlbIlaGroundMutual impedancesSelf impedancesPhaseAPhaseCPhaseCPhaseBPhaseBLINE LOADFigure 3.7: Three phase systemA three-phase, four-wire system showing source, distribution line and load.Three voltages Ea, Eb, Ec can be represented as phasors, like A, B and C in Figure 3.6, each withtheir own magnitude and phase angle. The matrix of these voltages is thus:Eabc =\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0EaEbEc\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb (3.4)To aid analysis of the system, these unbalanced system phasors can be described completely as thecombination of symmetric components[128]: a superposition of three sets of symmetric phasors.Three component phasors are denoted E0, E1, and E2 (for zero, positive and negative sequencesrespectively):\u2013 50 \u2013Chapter 3.

This causes additional currentto flow. However, at this point the currents are no longer balanced, so Ia + Ib + Ic 6= 0, such that a\u2013 51 \u20133.2. Network Modellingcurrent In flows in the neutral wire, and a voltage drop is present across Zn. Unbalance in the networkdisplaces the neutral wire voltage from ground[58].The resulting voltage at the neutral is given byVN =EaZda + Zla+EbZdb + Zlb+EcZdc + Zlc1Zda + Zla+1Zdb + Zlb+1Zdc + Zlc+1Zn(3.10)With additional load, the neutral is displaced from ground by voltage VN , as shown in 3.8(b). Thisoffset of the neutral must be accounted for in examining customer voltage levels. The resultant phase-neutral voltages at the customer for the unchanged phases B and C show a change both phase angle andmagnitude compared to the balanced case.The line, load and neutral-ground voltage phasors are dependent up on the power factor of the loadas well as the line. Additional loading on phase A creates a neutral offset voltage, which can cause thephase-to-neutral voltage VCN to rise \u2014- one permutation of phasors is shown in Figure 3.8(b). Withextra loading, the line voltage VLA increases in length. An example of unbalance caused by reducedloading is shown in Figure 3.8(c), in which the length of VLA is shorter than the other phases. Othervariations in the remaining phasors will occur in different configurations of distribution networks: withan increased load of power factor close to 1, even the phase-to-ground voltage VCG may rise, due to theincrease of the magnitude and angle of VLC , as shown in Figure 3.8(d).For small variations at constant power factor, the neutral voltage phasor extends approximatelylinearly with added or reduced load, although at high levels the line properties become significant andthis causes some noticeable rotation of the neutral voltage phasor.To summarise, unbalanced load or generation on an individual phase causes voltage rises and dropsrelative to neutral, which are also experienced by customers on other phases. Since the distribution net-work is predominantly composed of single-phase customers with uncoordinated use, there will inevitablybe unbalance, resulting in power flows in the neutral wire and neutral voltage offsets compared to ground,with their phasors dependent upon the nature (i.e. size and real/reactive components) of the customerload, the distribution line and the neutral wire impedances.3.2 Network ModellingThe theory outlined above explains the basic principles involved in the network effects of increasing load orgeneration. To investigate the effects in more complex and realistic networks, some of the simplificationsmust be removed. However, additional complexity can render analysis by inspection somewhat unwieldy.With appropriate models, software packages can be used to automate these analyses.

Lengths and angles are exaggerated for clarity.\u2013 53 \u20133.3. Model Selectionunderstanding of a network, models can be used to examine the impacts and effectiveness of controlsystems imposed upon them. In this way, the model can provide a tool for both analysis and testing.One network model was used provided a baseline throughout, but was implemented in three differentsoftware packages (PSCAD, IPSA and RSCAD), each for different purposes.The PSCAD models were predominantly used to improve understanding of network behaviour withthe highest levels of detail in various scenarios. PSCAD provided results of the unbalanced, single-phase,dynamic operation.In contrast, the IPSA models were much simpler: only balanced, steady-state, 3-phase operationwas supported, and the underlying network was simplified considerably. With these simplifications, theoutputs were be used directly in a database of operating states to create a simulation to test a multi-agentsystem in software.The RSCAD model was used to create a dynamic, unbalanced, single-phase real-time simulation ofthe electrical network that could be used in conjunction with hardware.3.2.1 Model PropertiesThe challenges of DERs and network growth are present at the LV and MV level. This is the part ofthe electrical network below 132kV, as outlined in Section 1.2. In particular, the effects at the domesticlevel are of interest. Benchmark LV networks are described in the literature, and can be used to developappropriate models.3.3 Model SelectionThe CIGRE EU Benchmark Low Voltage Microgrid[130] was adopted as a general-purpose LV studynetwork by the EU Microgrids[73] project. It comprises three feeders: one residential, one commercial,and one industrial. The transformer and conductor properties are known, along with half-hourly loadingcharacteristics. The benchmark microgrid includes proposed connection points and specifications forvarious DERs. However, for the UK residential context, the model is only partly appropriate: with sixhouses and two apartment blocks, the total of 26 domestic connections is low.The UK Generic LVDN[131] was used instead, focusing more on residential connections: the feeder isintended only to represent domestic supply.Ingram contends that \u201cnetwork impacts [may] be investigated on a relatively simple network repre-senting a residential system which would give the most onerous condition for voltage regulation\u201d[131].This model does use the minimum standards for new service cable connections from UK DNO ENWLalthough legacy connections may not meet this specification. However, the design is highly symmetricto begin with, so analysis starts from a position of phase balance. In terms of customer connections, themodel is relatively light: the DNO ENWL specifies a maximum of 200 customers per feeder. However,\u2013 54 \u2013Chapter 3. Electrical Network Modellingthe 11kV/400V transformers are almost at their maximum loading (499.2kVA of maximum loading of500kVA).Some assumptions were made about the network in order to implement it here:\u0088 No automatic voltage regulators present\u0088 Perfectly transposed conductors, implying zero mutual inductance\u0088 In common with the assumptions made in [132], additional grounding along the neutral wire isneglected.The UK Generic model has no normally-open points (shown in Figure 2.1, for increasing systemsecurity). In some real-world cases, these are connected with solid neutral, i.e. only the three phases arenormally open, and the neutral wire is connected.3.3.1 Customers and LoadingThe customer types of profile classes 1 and 2 as specified by ELEXON[19] are domestic consumers whichmay include those on an Economy 7 tariff. Averaged load profiles for these classes have maximumdemands of 0.9kW and 1.8kW after diversity. The Average Daily Maximum Demand (ADMD) used inthe UK Generic Network (UKGN) is 1.6kW across all customers.In the context of exploring the future of distribution networks as they experience changing use patterns,a scenario was envisaged where the average daily maximum demand was assumed to have increased to2.2kW per customer along one LV feeder. The minimum demand was maintained at 0.16kW.The 1.6kW ADMD is a conservative estimate. The source network model data uses a ADMD of1.3kVA per customer[131]. Measured data from the Netherlands smart meter programme confirms acurrent value of 1.2kW, but its examination of individual consumer loads gives further weight to the needto re-examine the standard method of calculation using a decades-old coincidence factor method. Thisis reconfirmed by recent results from the 2014 CLNR trials[133] of 8000 customers, which give ADMDresults for heat pumps users of 1.69kW, and EV users of 1.79kW, up from a base load of 0.9kW \u2014 a0.7\u20130.8kW increase per technology. This agrees with other results from the LCNF cluster that concludedthere is a need to update ADMD figures[3]. In contrast, the ADMD in the model was increased by 0.8kW\u2014 the use of more than one of these technologies in a single household would significantly increase theaverage power and also increase the coincidence factor due to their long duty cycle. Consequently, thevalues in the model represent a conservative approach to future growth.Furthermore, the distribution networks in the UK will have experienced growth in connections ashouses are built and connected to existing networks since their initial planning. One segment at 230Vhas been extended by 10% (i.e. 3 customers per phase) to illustrate the effects of growth. This would\u2013 55 \u20133.4. New Tool Developmentrequire the transformer to operate beyond its rated capacity periodically, potentially leading to thermalissues.These changes transform the generic network to include a heavily loaded feeder which will demonstratethe impacts of the combined challenges of electric vehicles and distributed generation on the UKs legacynetworks.3.4 New Tool DevelopmentThe networks were turned into tools for research through the use of software modelling packages.PSCAD[134] provides an interface to the ElectroMagnetic Transients including DC (EMTDC) softwarepackage by Manitoba Hydro International. It uses the method described by Dommel[135]. Networkcomponents are converted to a number of connected equivalent networks, each composed of an impedanceand a current source. A connection matrix of these equivalent networks is then used to create a set of(nonintegrable) differential equations. These are then computed iteratively over small timesteps usingthe trapezium rule to approximate the system response over time. The consequence is that an arbitrary,nonlinear network can be constructed, allowing for a 4-wire, unbalanced network to be simulated.IPSA+[136], from TNEI, is used for static, balanced, 3-wire operation. It uses a Newton-Raphsonmethod applied to a single-wire approach with the approximation that the phases are symmetric.RSCAD[137] provides an interface to RTDS hardware, also from Manitoba Hydro. Similar to PSCAD/EMTDC, it uses Dommel\u2019s method[135] in an ElectroMagnetic Transients Program (EMTP) approach,but with an implementation designed for parallel operation, where multiple processors perform the cal-culations simultaneously to provide real-time operation.3.4.1 PSCAD ModelA validated PSCAD model of the UK Generic LVDN was completed by Trichakis[138]. This implementa-tion was used as the basis from which modifications were made for PSCAD studies to better understandbehaviour at more points in the network and to explore future conditions.In common with the IPSA model above, the basic model was extended on one feeder from 96 to134 customers. Some of the original model\u2019s simplifications were reduced: some load aggregation wasremoved. This additional complexity provided an additional, disaggregated feeder, to examine the linksin network behaviour between devices at various points that were not previously visible.SSEG was added, and variable levels of generation, phase clustering and uniformity could be selected.Figure 3.12 shows the household load model.Figure 3.9 shows a high-level view of the PSCAD model. The overall model retains the basis fromIngram et al.[131], but the modifications discussed above have been made. Diagrams have been redrawnfrom the PSCAD interface for clarity.\u2013 56 \u2013Chapter 3.

The household consumption is is modelled with the variable loadcomponent. The load and generation controllers are not shown.\u2013 59 \u20133.4. New Tool Development3.4.1.1 Modelling ResultsPSCAD was used to model and simulate the network under normal operating conditions.For future network growth scenarios, including clustering effects, EVs were modelled in a cluster atthe end of the feeder, comprising a third of the total number of houses. This was replaced by EVs in athird of the houses within a single phase, and then extended to a third of the houses uniformly distributedthroughout. A similar process was followed for the impact of embedded generators.Qualitatively, the model behaved as expected: switching in additional load or generation causedbehaviour in line with the theory described in Section 3.1.1.4. Clustering DERs on particular phasescaused greater imbalance; devices at the end of the feeder exacerbated the voltage rise or drop. Inparticular, line-ground voltage rise was displayed by the system where a purely real load characteristicwas used.To illustrate likely impacts of individual items of equipment, a single EV charger (at 3kW) was addedat the remote end.At simulation time t=0.6s (to allow the system to stabilise), a 3kW EV charger was connected at theremote end of the feeder. Figure 3.13 shows the change in voltage profile at this point. The effect ofthe single connection is visible towards the busbar, but signal becomes very small: at the middle of thefeeder, the visible change in voltage is 0.034%, and at the busbar this drops to only 0.0034%. At thedevice, the voltage dropped by 1.1%, or 2.41V. The effect of a single device connection was well withinthe +-3% D-code limit. Voltage rise and drop are visible on the other two phases, although considerablysmaller than the effect on the loaded phase. The resulting unbalance causes current in the neutral wire,with a voltage phasor shown in Figure 3.14.Time (s)0.595 0.6 0.605 0.61 0.615 0.62 0.625 0.63 0.635Voltage (p.u.)0.910.9120.9140.9160.9180.920.922VaVbVcFigure 3.13: Effect of additional loadingAdditional unbalanced loading on phase A causes changes in (per-unit) voltage.

This includes amodel for a 33kV grid connection and features a double transformer arrangement, connected to a busbarwith aggregated loads, of which one is presented in more detail; this, in turn, is further decomposed toshow a low-voltage transformer in front of clusters of individual customers.Load820kVALoad1020kVA20kVALoad9400VBusbar20kVA20kVALoad133kV busbarLoad143x125kVA20kVA 20kVALoad137x250kVA        20kVALoad720kVALoad11Load65x2MVA20kVALoad520kVALoad420kVALoad311kV busbar20kVALoad12Load233kV Supply20kVAFigure 3.15: IPSA+ model of extended UK Generic LVDNAlong with the existing lumped-feeder simplifications in the benchmark specification, the customerswere aggregated in groups of approximately nine and modelled as balanced three-phase loads.Before additional load or generation was added to the reference case, the validation study specified in[131] was repeated to assess that the model behaved as expected. For each of the points on the networkdiagram shown in Figure 3.16, the voltage level was recorded (per-unit of nominal at that level) and isshown in Figure 3.17.Three cases are used here: a) full load on 6 11kV feeders; b) full load on 3 11kV feeders, minimumload on 3 11kV feeders; and c) minimum load on 5 11kV feeders, full load on detailed feeder only.

The source voltage (at Position A in Figure 3.16) was fixed at 1.0 p.u.; validation testing did notinclude varying the source voltage. The voltage regulation figures are shown in Table 3.1.

The additional four aggregatedloads and service cables were added at uniform distances along the extension. The ADMD was increased\u2013 62 \u2013Chapter 3. Electrical Network Modellingfrom 1.3kVA to 2.1kVA to reflect increased consumption associated with technologies such as EVs andHPs. This quite deliberately pushes the network beyond its original design. Operation beyond the currentlimits of the transformers may be possible for limited durations, and in a real-world case, at this pointsome level of network reinforcement or intervention might be necessary.The software was used to compute the voltage levels at those 14 clustered load points with the systemin balanced 3-phase steady-state operation, each steady state referred to below as an \u201coperating point\u201d.The model was scripted in Python in order to iterate through all the permutations of 14 aggregatedloads, and later 6 aggregated SSEGs, switched either on or off to find the balanced steady steady stateof the system at each operating point. For a load, an \u201coff\u201d state reduced the demand to a nonzero baseload of the average minimum daily demand. This created a database of discrete steady-state voltagemeasurements for the network. This database was used for a computer simulation of the network state toa software load agent operating at the terminal of each aggregated load or generator through a SimulationAgent (SA) broadcasting the appropriate new voltage level at each location whenever the operating pointchanged. This formed a threshold for testing based on computer memory constraints. All the loadswere fully controllable, and an SSEG penetration of up to 43% at 3kW per customer (as per the G83/1regulations discussed in Chapter 2) could be simulated. This SSEG was modelled as a negative load,a common simplification which means no distinction is made between different sources such as CHP,micro-wind or PV. Overall, this allowed simple load profiles to be created to illustrate various scenarios.Tap changers were set at 1.02p.u., 1.04p.u. and 1.07p.u. for the 11kV-0.433V transformer. Thesteady-state voltage at the test feeder varied according to the values shown in Table 3.2. Whilst theovervoltage case appears to be shown in all the scenarios, the undervoltage case only appears at lowertap settings. In these simulations, the other feeders experienced only light loading: the UK GenericNetwork assumes that the feeders will not experience maximum demand at the same time. The modelshowed undervoltage cases extending to include more than a third of customers in the 1.04p.u. case wherethis load factor is increased on other feeders, even before the case where adding additional demand wasincluded for EVHP use. Table 3.2 also shows large values for voltage regulation (VR), and it is likelythat DNO-set limits would be exceeded.Simulation resultsTap setting Vmin (p.u.) Vmax (p.u.)

New Tool Development3.4.3 RSCAD ModelRSCAD, like PSCAD, simplifies a network and represents it as an impedance matrix. Whilst RSCADallows for construction of arbitrary networks, the complexity is limited by the the size of the matrix forwhich the hardware can compute the next state in real time. More complex networks can be simulated,but only if they incorporate components at a distance sufficient that they can be considered to beindependent over a single time-step. A step time of 50\u00b5s is used, so a separation of 15km is required,which is not present in the UKGN. Consequently, several simplifications have to be made in comparisonwith the PSCAD model.The overview of the RSCAD model is shown in Figure 3.18. The two-transformer arrangement at33kV has been replaced with a single transformer at full power rating. Aggregated loads are balanced,three-phase loads, with the exception of the final 400V feeder. There is a limitation at the 400V level,since the neutral line for the (disaggregated) single phase would be common to all three phases at thecustomer end, but in this case is not shared with the other two phases.Figure 3.19 shows the remote end of the feeder down to the household level. At the remote end, housesare modelled individually, where a house is at full or zero load. Houses usually retain a baseload (andaverage minimum of 160W is considered in the UKGN), but in comparison with the case of switchingan individual household load of around 3kW, this is not considered significant. As such, at a moredisaggregated level, switching events from the customer \u2014 by appliance use or by agent-based controller\u2014 are more accurately represented.At each house, a node is shown, labelled N1 . . . N15. At each node, the voltage is recorded for eachsimulation timestep and output to the RTDS hardware analogue IO cards. Control outputs from controlhardware are read by RTDS hardware digital IO cards at each timestep and applied as the state for eachswitch BRK1 . . . BRK15 which determines the connection state of that house\u2019s load.Whilst the RSCAD model can output to screen to show real-time voltage levels, its main function isfor real-time hardware integration into the MAS test-bed described in Section 5.2.5 in greater detail.\u2013 64 \u2013Chapter 3.

The individual loads are modelled as static resistances with circuit breakers.3.5 ConclusionRelevant basic theory of electrical network behaviour was outlined in Section 3.1. The requirements formore complex network modelling were outlined in Section 3.2, and existing study networks and theirqualities were discussed in Section 3.3. Software packages for modelling and simulation were discussedin Section 3.4 along with description of how tools were developed and adapted for the research task forthree purposes: demonstrating complex network behaviour, allowing simple software simulation, and forreal-time, dynamic, hardware-in-the-loop application.The PSCAD model showed highly location-dependent effects, in line with the underlying theory; theseproperties are used in the development of location tools in Chapter 4; the IPSA+ and RSCAD modelsare then used directly as tools in the Multi-Agent Testbed described in Section 5.2.\u2013 66 \u2013Chapter 4Location in Low-VoltageDistribution NetworksConcepts of location are developed in this chapter in terms of electrical location, geographical locationand parallels between them. Latitude and longitude are combined with electrical measurements in anoriginal technique to create a graph of proximate nodes. Electrical network theory and signal processingtechniques are used to develop new methods for identifying electrical connections and applied on a datasetof voltage measurements collected from the real distribution network. These combined derived locationdata are used in constructing network models that are useful for control systems.4.1 Location4.1.1 Location in controlThe specific impacts of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in Low-Voltage Distribution Networks(LVDNs) are explored in Chapter 3. As shown in the literature and from the results of the networkmodelling, there are several implications: voltage rise, reverse power flows and degraded power qualitymay result from large-scale integration of Distributed Generation (DG). EVs may cause network issues(primarily thermal overloading of transformers and voltage drop) where uptake reaches a third of cus-tomers, or even lower[43]. Connection phase affects unbalance and clusters of devices will impact moreheavily than if they were uniformly distributed[132]. Thermal and voltage issues due to heavy loadingare exacerbated by increasing the distance (and therefore line impedance) between equipment and trans-former busbars: the LV network has resistive conductors, so power is wasted through ohmic heating ofthe distribution line.Connection policies can be used to help prevent these problems. \u201cHeadrooom\u201d is the spare capacity in\u2013 67 \u20134.1. Locationthe network for additional connections. Where headroom is available, A first-come-first-served approachwould allow connection of power generation equipment up to the available system capacity, but could beconsidered unfair by customers paying the same service charge to DNOs but not permitted to connectSSEGs because of others installing equipment earlier.Alternatively, controllers could be added to DERs to mitigate some of these issues \u2014 for example, ina feeder with 100 customers, a new PV array may be permitted to supply power back to the grid for upto one hundredth of the available headroom in the equipment. However, this may not be optimal, andresult in a small handful of constrained generators operating alongside considerable unused headroom.A control solution that does not take the wider network context into account will either operatemore conservatively than required or risk the case of a locally acceptable operation causing unacceptableglobal impacts that are not assessed in any way by the control system. Consequently, a location-awarecontroller may be able to determine and operate within network-specific control requirements, or act ina more effective manner than a controller that does not have this information.4.1.2 Describing location in LVDNsThere are numerous properties that can be considered as location factors in electrical networks, such as:\u0088 nominal voltage level\u0088 impedance between nodes\u0088 connection phase\u0088 position on radial feeder\u0088 intermediate nodesThese properties begin to become analogous to geographical properties \u2014 impedance can be thought ofas a kind of electrical distance; intermediate nodes are nearer neighbours. These properties are important:as shown in Chapter 3, loads connected at the same substation may contribute to a common power limit,but if two nodes are on different phases then their influence over each other\u2019s voltages may be limited.These properties, then, could be represented for use in control. An appropriate representation mustbe developed to allow for their analysis, as conventional electrical network models only provide a partialsolution. Furthermore, as discussed in Section 2.2.6, the availability of network data cannot be assumed,and may even be undesirable. In the absence of existing models or complete data, there is an openresearch question of how to construct a network model using locally available information that is usefulfor control.4.1.3 Local and global informationA centralised control system could be pre-programmed with network topology including the location andproperties of any DERs. This system could use some centrally-held global information to determine\u2013 68 \u2013Chapter 4. Location in Low-Voltage Distribution Networksoptimum settings to control individual devices. However, this has several shortcomings \u2014 in scalabilityand reliability[4], including single points of failure and communication bottlenecks, as well as issues withsystem maintenance and scalability as components are added under G83/1. A database of known networkinformation is problematic: it may be commercially sensitive or protected for security purposes. Sincethe UK system is divided into regional monopolies, coordination of multiple system operators would benecessary. The multi-stakeholder context outlined in Section 1.3.1 makes it problematic to capture ordescribe the global context. Data may not exist to a relevant detail level in all locations. The databasewould have to be maintained and updated regularly.The rationale for decentralised control is similar to the reasoning behind why an individual con-troller may be improved through self-configuration with location information and learning about itsconnections. Decentralisation and self-configuration (where the network topology is derived locally) fit amulti-stakeholder context where generation, load and network assets have different owners.Consequently, a single owner for all the relevant data has significant disadvantages. Further, for asingle owner for all the relevant data even to exist, there would need to be a change in the regulatoryset-up of the power network.Self-configuration means that user intervention is not required and there is no need for a DNO torelease sensitive data or confidential information about network structure. This lowers the barriers toentry in LVDN control: the use of plug-and-play agents reduces the cost of implementation.4.1.4 Electrical network and modellingFigure 4.1 shows a conventional single-line diagram of a three-phase radial network. In comparison,Figure 4.2 shows an electrical network superimposed on a street map. It is generally indicative of thelayout of the network \u2013 the phase connections are visible, as are the locations of various transformers.The properties of the power lines are not included, nor are the connections to individual houses. However,the layout can be used in constructing the model shown in Figure 4.1.1kV/0.4kV TransformerLoad Load Load Load Load Load LoadFigure 4.1: Radial feeder. The transformer (left) steps voltage down to 400V (or 240V single-phase). Thesingle line running left to right represents a three phase distribution line; customers (usually) connect toa single phase of the supply.Models inevitably include simplifications. The single line in Figure 4.1 represents all three phases; theloads are clusters of houses \u2013 this model only goes part of the way to describing some connections shown\u2013 69 \u20134.1. LocationFigure 4.2: Electrical network overlaid on a mapThe image shows the electrical network overlaid on an outline street map of an urban area. Single,two- and three-phase lines are visible. The connections to individual properties are not marked. Figurereproduced from [140].\u2013 70 \u2013Chapter 4. Location in Low-Voltage Distribution Networksin the street map, and this sort of representation is widely used for static, balanced network studies.There are other ways of representing distribution networks in a way that facilitates analysis. Kersting[140]details an effective network model that uses a geographical area, such as a housing estate, covering all thecustomers supplied by a transformer. The area is bounded by a trapezium. It is assumed to have uniformloading across customers, and the area thus has a \u201cload density\u201d. Whilst the exact topology is not explicitin the model, the information is sufficient for estimating network behaviour (for approximating currentdraw and voltage drop) at any given point in the area and in aggregate.The accuracy of such a model could be improved by the use of loading and impedance density functionsfor the given area \u2014 although when the assumption of balanced operation is removed, the advantages ofthe model simplicity are lost. Such a model is also difficult to construct without prior information aboutthe characteristics of an area, including a method to allocate its geometry. Rather, by taking a graph-based approach, the nature of connection between network elements can be analysed: the system maybe represented as a graph consisting of a number of customer nodes connected by edges with electricalnetwork properties.Depending upon the goals of network analysis, the underlying topology could be simplified even fromFigure 4.1. A path structure (see Figure 4.3) might be appropriate for a voltage control task, since theimpact of a given node is related to its distance in a resistive distribution network.Smart MeterSmart MeterSmart MeterSmart MeterSmart MeterFigure 4.3: Simple pathSmart meter nodes connected as a path: they form a chain according to their position on a power line.However, this simplification may go too far for a general-purpose model. It does not allow for infor-mation about phase, and branches in the network and clusters of houses (of the kind visible in Figure4.2) are ignored.To expand a little, some complexity can be included. Figure 4.4 gives a picture of clusters of housesconnected to a transformer: Individual users are connected by service cables at a bus along a radial feeder(to points labelled as \u201cdummy nodes\u201d in Figure 4.4) \u2013 they are a point where the network branches butno active device exists at this point. This is a more complex graph: it uses a tree structure. Furtherdetail can be added: for example, edges connecting the nodes may be given relevant properties such as anumber to represent the impedance between them.End (consumer) nodes connected to one phase are connected in terms of total load, as per Chapter3, but separate to those on another phase for the purpose of line voltage. The structure of a graph usedfor control must then be relevant for its purpose.Figure 4.5 gives a simple tree structure appropriate for thermal limits control. It neglects the charac-\u2013 71 \u20134.1.

A number of customers (the nodes, represented by a smart meter) areconnected (via the edges of the graph) to the common transformer node. Despite the graph not repre-senting physical powerlines connecting devices, it may still be an adequate model for a thermal limitscontrol task where all the nodes have an impact on total current draw.As in both Kersting\u2019s area-based approximation[140] and the single-line simplification, the networkmodel that is used by any individual controller need not necessarily adopt a topology that strictly followsthat of the electrical connections. Rather, it is important that the model is useful in allowing the controllerto assess its impact on the network. Instead of attempting create a model of all three phases, a hybrid ofthese simplifications outlined above would allow a controller to assess its link to other nodes for voltageand current. This has the advantage that the information held about the edges reflects the impact of therelevant node and can be updated as the result of controller action becomes known.The final graph will thus combine a geographical approach with electrical assessment to form a modelthat will reflect electrical connection properties (rather than exact powerline layouts) to inform controllerchoices and allow for revision over time.4.1.5 Types of Location4.1.5.1 Electrical Topology AnaloguesImpedance of a distribution line is proportional to its length, so for two connected devices the distancebetween them is analogous to the impedance between them. This premise forms the basis for the calcu-lations in [140], which assumes a uniformly-distributed load in a residential setting to estimate voltagedrop along a feeder.Information for electrical network location information can be derived from several sources, such asan address within an IT network, Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates, or by measuring localelectrical network activity and comparing it with other locations in the system.Adjacent houses may be connected to the same part of the electricity network. However, this is byno means guaranteed: houses may be connected to different phases, or even different feeders entirely.\u2013 73 \u20134.1. LocationDistant houses in rural areas may be connected over much larger distances than those in urban areas.Despite this, location data of various sorts offer an approximation to electrical network data. These caninclude geographical location, area derived from the mobile phone network, or through communicationsnetwork properties.As well as referring to location as the point of connection in an electrical network, location can alsoapply to geographical position or connection to an Information and Communication Technology (ICT)network. There may be overlap between these locations: for example, we may suppose that two geograph-ically adjacent houses may be connected to the same electric distribution feeder. Location informationcan be derived from many sources: radio signals from GPS satellites give a precise geographical position;a postal code input upon installation provides an approximate area. Many smart meters are networkedvia mobile phone towers, which could be grouped by cell ID, or mapped to physical coverage area. Thesegeographical properties can be used as an analogue to electrical location, although proximity is not neces-sarily a guarantee of a common connection. ICT network proximity (measured by latency or by commonaccess point hardware) may indicate a common electrical connection. In particular, Power Line Commu-nication (PLC) can be used directly to infer electrical connections between devices, since the distributionline itself is used as the medium for passing data.Electrical network characteristics can be used to identify the nature of connections by using directon-line measurement. Analysis of signals on the electrical network will show differences in connectionphase, as well as identify where devices do not have any common connection.4.1.5.2 Multi-Factor LocationMultiple sources of location information can be used together. Strong indicators \u2014 such as identifyingcommon signals on the electrical network \u2014 can be combined with appropriately weighted weaker indi-cators, such as geographical coordinates or areas, to give both a location and a value for confidence inthat assessment. A process whereby the agent learns about the effectiveness of its control actions allowsa dynamic multi-factor location system to adjust its confidence in topology. Machine learning used inconjunction with assessment of the impact of each action would provide a degree of intelligence in controlsystems in a network.Several layers could be used: control graphs of different types, such as Figure 4.5 or 4.3, could becombined with an overlay graph where each edge is allocated a weight that corresponds to the impact anaction may have with respect to those nodes. Due to a reflexive process of adjusting confidences basedon location data sources and observing responses to control decisions, the correctness of the initial treebecomes less relevant than knowledge of what its impacts are as the controller learns from experience.This learning, combined approach is beyond the scope of this work, but the implementation of multipleassessments of location provides first steps towards an intelligent capability in this regard.\u2013 74 \u2013Chapter 4. Location in Low-Voltage Distribution Networks4.2 Location from Geographical InformationWhile latitude/longitude coordinates do not provide a complete picture of electrical connections, theycan be used as a first filter to drastically reduce the search space of connected devices.The Global Positioning System (GPS) allows a radio receiver to determine latitude/longitude coor-dinates accurate to within a few feet by the use of highly accurate time signals sent from a network ofsatellites. These can be used to determine the geographical distance between devices.There is currently a lack of reliable or ubiquitous communication links between grid-connected devices,and the cost of deploying wired technology is high. The approach to the UK smart meter roll-outincludes the use of the mobile telephone network[141], where each meter contains a SIM card to allowcommunication through GPRS, 3G or 4G connection. Under a standard cellular network, each deviceconnects to a base station which covers a certain geographical area; the unique identifier assigned toeach receiver can be used to identify devices within the same \u2018cell\u2019. The ID number does not providegeographical location. Users may be nearby but in different cells; in areas of overlap the cell identity maychange. The cell ID \u2014 along with signal strength data and other detected cells \u2014 can be used to providea more precise location. There are companies partnered with the mobile phone network operators ableto provide Geographical Information System (GIS)) data including base station ID, coverage areas andgeographical location as a basis for a location service. Public implementations such as the W3C or GoogleGeolocation Application Program Interfaces (APIs) provide a direct location lookup using these data.For additional accuracy, other signals such as nearby WiFi networks may be included. Areas with highdensity of mobile cells and additional signals may provide accuracy to a few tens of metres; in extra-ruralareas, this is reduced to the kilometre scale.Postcode lookup provides a hybrid between geographical point and mobile-like cell structure. Post-codes are areas that cover clusters of nearby buildings, although some high-volume post users are assigneda unique postcode. Coverage areas are publicly available. The postcode of the device would be enteredonce during commissioning. Postcodes are usually static once assigned, but some areas have been re-structured over time.PLC offers one solution: devices superimpose data signals onto the electrical network. This providesan easy way to find nearby devices: they are connected to the same information network bus, and anyconnected to the same feeder will be able to read those signals. Additional equipment would be requiredto filter signals going up the distribution network, so as not to cause interference, and inter-feeder (orinter-phase) communications would require an addressing and bridging system. The system would needto be designed not to interfere with any existing PLC equipment.Similarly, directional antennae may be used in conjunction with a radio communications network to\u2013 75 \u20134.2. Location from Geographical Informationidentify the distance to neighbours sharing the link. Each agent maintains a list of neighbours whosesignals it can detect and the signal strength and direction indicates its location. No absolute geographicalposition is known.IP geo-location uses communications network connection information to determine location. At itsmost basic level, devices connected to the Internet are assigned an address which can be used to establishthe Internet Service Provider (ISP), and provide a city of connection. Sometimes, more detailed analysisis possible, where network exchanges are known and additional data (such as packet round-trip time)is available, but the resolution and accuracy of this approach is insufficient for LV network connectioninformation. It is possible, however, to assign addresses based on a known location; devices wouldthen address a particular subnet to communicate with connected devices at the appropriate level. Thisunfortunately begs the question, since correctly assigning an address requires complete knowledge of thedistribution network.The GPS routing protocol requires each device to be connected to a tree of (virtual) routers, thisincreases points of failure, and creates an issue of maintenance and responsibility. Similar approachesusing agents at dummy nodes are also excluded for the same reason.For the purposes of this work, the acquisition of geographical data is simplified to using the coordinatesfrom GPS to provide a straightforward geographical location that does not rely on additional (remote)equipment, or complex mutliparameter analysis.4.2.1 Geographical tree creationIn the first instance, it is assumed that the distribution network is radial, has no spurs, and that thegeographical distance increases with electrical distance, as in Figure 4.1. The aim is to create an undi-rected graph (Figure 4.6) of connected nodes on the same phase, where each node is a control agent atthe customer.Upon startup, a new agent registers with the agent platform and directories. It registers its owngeographical coordinates, and requests those of its two nearest neighbours. This allows it to begin toconstruct a graph of nodes, shown in Figure 4.7, where the new device N \u2032 is situated between existingdevices N1 and N2 on the network and the edge is the geographical distance. The graph is representedinternally as a connection matrix. Self-connections are excluded and disconnections are represented as\u221e. Each agent stores a partial representation of the full network topology.Agent Agent Agent Agent AgentFigure 4.6: Agents are connected in a path. according to their positionRepresenting connections in this graph form already allows the agent to make deductions about the\u2013 76 \u2013Chapter 4.

Here, a new customer is represented by a deviceN \u2032, and it is inserted into the graph G1.structure of the network: if the distances N1\u2212N \u2032 and N2\u2212N \u2032 are both less than N1\u2212N2, the device isbetween them (true in the 1D case below, requiring verification in the 2D case due to the possibility ofcomplex geometry); otherwise, it is at the end of the graph. In the case where N \u2032 is not the most remoteon the feeder, N2 has knowledge of a node (e.g. N3) on the feeder beyond N\u2032; having found a connection,N \u2032 announces its existence to N1 and N2; if appropriate, N2 responds with details of N3.If this is connection is found, N \u2032 is inserted into G1 between N1 and the next closest neighbour in G1.This change is then propagated through the tree. If, however, the test shows the nodes are not connectedto the same phase, N \u2032 selects the next-nearest neighbour that is not in G1 and repeats the process. Ifit exhausts G1, it has no neighbours on the same phase or feeder, and is the start of a new section ofdistribution network.Figure 4.7 shows the updated graph G1\u2032 after successfully identifying its location. The node N hasbeen registered with the global database. The edge connecting N1 and N2 must be removed, and twoconnecting edges put in its place. Rather than the tree structure in Figure 4.5 and the more realisticFigure 4.4, this graph describes the simplified connection shown in Figure 4.3, and it is assumed that theorder of two devices at a common terminal is not important.4.2.2 2D GeometryIf a node fails to find a connection altogether, it forms the start of a new graph.One potential shortcoming of this method is the potential for disjoint graphs to form where a con-nection existed. As well as in the complex geometries that may occur in an urban setting, this may alsooccur at a boundary such as an urban-rural transition (shown in Figure 4.8) where a high concentrationof users drops off suddenly to long, sparse connections.R2 is the closest electrically connected node to a new node at R1. If the node ends its attempts tooearly, then it will form an isolated tree, and nodes connecting between R1 and R2 will be isolated fromone another despite their electrical connection.Geographical distance does not necessarily increase with electrical distance. Consider the terracedhousing in Figure 4.9. In this case, Load 1 is geographically closer to Load 12 than to Load 6. However,it is electrically more distant, so creating the graph in Figure 4.7 is not appropriate. In order to examinethis, the node performs a walk.\u2013 77 \u20134.2. Location from Geographical InformationUrban RuralR1R2Figure 4.8: Urban-rural transition. In this exaggerated illustration, the node R1 is close to a large numberof electrically disconnected nodes, and may end up isolated from its neighbour R2.Load 12 Load 11 Load 10 Load 9 Load 8 Load 7Load 2 Load 3 Load 4 Load 5 Load 6Load 11kV/0.4kV TransformerFigure 4.9: Geographical layout of network topologyThe figure shows a hypothetical network with 2D geometry where a housing terrace has electricallydistant but geographically proximate nodes.\u2013 78 \u2013Chapter 4. Location in Low-Voltage Distribution Networks4.2.2.1 Tree walkConsider nodes at Loads 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 in Figure 4.9. A new controller enters at Load 12, and it isclosest geographically to the node at Load 1. N \u2032 receives the graph G1. It walks the tree (potentially intwo directions, if N1 is not at the start or end of the tree). If, at any point, the next node is closer toN \u2032 than the previous one encountered on the walk, the network has the geographical property outlinedabove: here, distance from Load 12 increases for Loads 1, 3, and 5 \u2014 but decreases from Load 5 to Load7, and again from Load 7 to Load 9, leading it to conclude it has this geometry. The node will be finallyadded at the minimum geographical distance.4.2.3 Proof of conceptIn order to test these initial approaches to tree creation, the UK Generic LVDN[131] was assumed torepresent a linear UK residential street. The tool developed for testing in Section 3.4.2 was used for thispurpose: arbitrary location co-ordinates were assigned to each load. Figure 4.10 shows the schematicof the proof-of-concept network: an extract of the remote end of the UK Generic LVDN is shown; thedashed arrows to the left indicate the upstream network beyond the 11kV busbar. The loads (indicatedwith arrows and labelled) are connected along a hypothetical linear housing terrace, depicted below.Each load point is allocated arbitrary (x,y) geographical coordinates in 3D space. An additional load,indicated by the dashed line, will be connected for illustration. A controller at each load will determineits own local connection graph.11kV/0.4kV Transformer3 x 125kVA11kV busbarTo 33kV transformers and supplyTo further 11kV connections Load 2(0,2)Load 1(0,1)Load 4(0,4)Load 6(0,6)Load 3(0,3)Load 5(0,5)Load 8(0,8)Load 7(0,7)Load 10(0,10)Load 12(0,12)Load 9(0,9)Load 11(0,11)Load 8'(0,8.7)Figure 4.10: Proof-of-concept geographical graphThe figure shows the remote end of the UK Generic Network[131], with loads at coordinates (x,y) rep-reseenting a hypothetical linear housing terrace. An additional load, indicated at the house with dashedline, will be connected.\u2013 79 \u20134.2. Location from Geographical InformationA Multi-Agent System (MAS) was used to represent the load nodes1. Each agent supported thealgorithm developed above in Section 4.2.1. The size of the graph representation held by each agentwas arbitrarity limited: for a full implementation, a trade-off is required between minimising graph sizefor internal storage, processing and planning, whilst keeping a reasonable representation of its sphere ofinfluence2. For the purpose of the proof-of-concept, each node would attempt to build a graph of threenodes only, to demonstrate the cases in Section 4.2.1. This forced the graph to be limited and withoutrepresenting the complete network, whilst allowing each node knowledge of its surrounding peers.The load nodes each joined the network in sequence 1-12. To illustrate, the output of the end nodeL12 is given in Figure 4.11, edited for readability.Load Agent 12 L12Current location 0 12[...]finished all setup[Find neighbours]Received neighbour list (# 0 L12; # 1 L11; # 2 L10 [...])[Measure distances][Connection matrix][ ][L12, L11, L10][L12][inf, 100, inf][L11][100, inf, 100][L10][inf, 100, inf]Figure 4.11: Edited debug output from proof-of-concept graph agentThe agent starts; takes a list of nearby agents, and draws up the connection matrix.

The graph from the connection matrix is shown in Figure 4.14.At this point, an update would be propagated to the surrounding nodes via a whisper protocol3,1For reference, the technical set-up for the hardware platform and multi-agent framework are described in detail inSection 5.2.32In Section 4.3.7, it is argued that computational intensity of processing the full graph of N nodes increases with N2.3Simple, unicast message propagation, also commonly referred to as gossip or telephone.\u2013 80 \u2013Chapter 4.

Thus, each agent L in the network has constructed a graph GL that represents itsgeographical conditions constrained by local knowledge. These geographically-derived graphs will requireverification of electrical connection, which will be discussed in Section 4.3.4.3 Location from electrical signals4.3.1 OverviewLocal electrical measurements of voltage and current can be used by a node to infer electrical locationinformation.Local current measurements can be used to determine whether events on power systems are caused byloads at the customer. These events can be characterised as upstream or downstream[142]. These can beused for determining the equivalent impedance of the grid at the node. However, this does not directlygive information about the impact of nearby nodes and requires combination with other information tocharacterise the nature of the connection between them.Another approach is to examine local voltages. Consider the electrical network consisting of an ACgenerator, an RL distribution line and a load impedance, shown in Figure 4.15.When we consider two users connected to a common electrical network separated by a power line\u2013 81 \u20134.3.

Location in Low-Voltage Distribution Networks(Figure 4.15(b)), there will be a difference in the line-neutral voltage at those two nodes. The voltagefor a household consumer is permitted to vary from a nominal value. In the UK, this is 220V, \u00b110%[39].In the traditional distribution network, the voltage will decrease over the line with increasing line lengthfrom the transformer.The voltage along the line may be altered by the voltage output of the transformer. The windingsof the transformer will have a number of \u2018taps\u2019 that allow connection to some numbers of turns thatdeviate from the nominal ratio by a small amount. The transformer will usually be configured with anoutput voltage a little above the nominal value so that at the remote end it will still be above the lowerpermitted voltage limits after accounting for the voltage drop over the line. A change in voltage at ahigher voltage level will change the voltage lower down the system, since the transformers merely operateon a ratio of one voltage level to another. At higher voltages, the winding tap of the transformer may bechanged whilst it is still energised; these are not frequently changed at the low voltage end of the system,although this may change as On-Load Tap Changers (OLTCs) become cheaper and viable as these activenetwork technologies are applied deeper into distribution networks.A change in load will change the current through the line. Because of the resistance of the line,increasing loading will decrease voltage. Conversely, there will also be a rise in voltage towards anygenerator (e.g. PV panel) connected to the system.As previously described, changes in transformer taps, load or generation will cause changes in themagnitude of the voltage that will be experienced by two electrically connected nodes, with the changeincluding a phase shift dictated by the impedance of the line between them.Household consumers use the electricity network by connecting to a single phase. Areas are splitso that the aggregated consumption patterns give, on average, balanced power use across the phases.However, in reality they are not perfectly balanced.A radial feeder experiences voltage drop across its length. By comparing voltage levels with sur-rounding nodes, it may be feasible to create an ordered list of nodes with increasing distance from thetransformer. This requires a simplifying assumption that neglects the contribution of the impedance ofthe service cable to the property; uneven loading; and different lengths of cable. Depending on the ap-plication, however, strict ordering may not be necessary: the size of the error caused by this assumptionmay determine whether a poorly ordered list is a sufficient approximation of the reality to remain usefulfor control. In any event, however, the voltage rise caused by DG unfortunately rules this out as a reliabletechnique as networks transition to smart grids incorporating DERs.Instantaneous measurements, then, do not provide sufficient location information. Observations overtime allow a node to observe the behaviour of the network from its location. Communication with othernodes then allows for these behaviours to be compared, and for network topology information to be\u2013 83 \u20134.3. Location from electrical signalsinferred. It is useful to consider how location data that might be derived from observations over differenttimescales, and the challenges that arise from these respective approaches.4.3.2 Signal processing techniquesIn considering how local measurements taken over time may be used to infer location, there are existingsignal processing tools that can be adapted to this application. The following section gives an overview ofsignal cross-correlation, hypothesis testing and filtering; the subsequent sections then discuss the availablesignals and how these techniques may be applied.4.3.2.1 Cross-correlationThe cross-correlation of two signals f and g gives a measure of the similarity between them.(f ? g)(\u03c4)def=\u222b \u221e\u2212\u221ef\u2217(t) g(t+ \u03c4) dt (4.1)That is, cross-correlation at time \u03c4 is the sum of the product of each data point pair (f(t), g(t + \u03c4)) ofthe two waveforms.For a system using sampled (i.e. discrete) data, normalised to the number of samples,(f ? g)[m]def=1NN\u22121\u2211n=0f [n] g[n+m] (4.2)Equation 4.2 allows finite-length, discrete signals that share sampling intervals to be examined: theresult is a new sequence that is the combined length of series f and g. Whilst 4.1 is centred around timet = 0, the resulting series of 4.2 begins at sample m = 0.Where the waveform is most similar, the product is maximised. A time delay between the two signalsbecomes apparent, as the maximum will be at some value that is not \u03c4 = 0. For sampled data, thismeans that a maximum at m = n indicates there is no phase shift between the two signals.4.3.2.2 Hypothesis testing4.3.2.2.1 Choosing from alternativesIn considering the application of cross-correlation to establish the existence of a connection betweennodes and their phase allocations, there are several alternatives that are possible. The following casesare possible and of use in the control problem for voltage:\u0088 nodes not connected to the same feeder.\u0088 nodes connected to the same feeder, but different phases\u0088 nodes connected to the same feeder on the same phase\u2013 84 \u2013Chapter 4. Location in Low-Voltage Distribution NetworksOther location information may be useful - multiple feeders may emerge from a single transformer,and the information might be used in control for thermal limits at that transformer. For voltage limitscontrol, however, these are the appropriate cases to include in the electrical topology map since themodelling in Chapter 3 shows the voltage linkage from customer use is minor across multiple feeders.Hypothesis testing provides a method for choosing between a number of options given a test statistic,based on the probability of the individual observation occurring for each alternative.4.3.2.2.2 Probabilistic ApproachThe probabilities of the cases occurring may be known in advance, a priori. The probability, P , of thehypothesis Hn occurring isP (Hn) (4.3)The probability, P , of the hypothesis Hn being correct, given a particular observation x, is denoted:P (Hn|x) (4.4)These probabilities are after measurement of x, and hence a posteriori. A simple decision rule is to chooseH0 ifP (H0|x) > P (H1|x) (4.5)That is,P (H0|x)P (H1|x) > 1 (4.6)The probability of a particular observation can be expressed as a Probability Density Function (PDF), apriori in p(x) and a posteriori in pn(x) for each case Hn. Then,P (H0|x) = p0(x)P (H0)p(x)(4.7)This can then be substituted back into the test in Equation 4.6 to give:p0(x)P (H0)p1(x)[1\u2212 P (H0)] > 1 (4.8)where P (H1) = 1\u2212 P (H0). Rearranging, choose H1 ifp1(x)p0(x)\u2265 P (H0)1\u2212 P (H0) (4.9)The ratio on the left of Equation 4.9 is the likelihood ratio.\u2013 85 \u20134.3. Location from electrical signals4.3.2.2.3 Error rates and a priori informationWith two overlapping PDFs, it is obvious that an observation in the overlap region could have occurreddue to either case. It is useful to define the likelihood of an incorrect hypothesis being chosen. Considerthe decision, D1, to choose H1. Assuming that the case was, in fact, H0, the probability the decision isincorrect isP (D1|H0) (4.10)and is the probability of \u2018false alarm\u2019 (i.e. a Type I error). Similarly,P (D0|H1) (4.11)is the probability of a false negative (i.e. a Type II error).The a priori probabilities of the cases may not be known, although the conditional PDFs may be. Itcan be shown that the error rates can be used to define the threshold for a decision rule. The Neyman-Pearson criterion can be used to define the threshold to maximise the probability of detection for a givenprobability of false alarm. Consider the region R1 in which H1 is chosen; then the probability of falsealarm is the area of the PDF for H0 in that region:P (D1|H0) =\u222bR1p0(x)dx (4.12)The solution for the lower bound of R1 is then the threshold for the likelihood ratio test (Equation 4.9),and may be obtained without the a priori probabilities.4.3.2.3 FilteringThe components that make up the power system include customer equipment and power system equip-ment. Customer equipment might include kettles or power showers switched on for a few minutes ata time, or lower-power equipment such as a refrigerator with a known duty cycle. Network equipmentincludes components such as transformers with tap-changers used for voltage control. Filtering allows fre-quency components of signals to be isolated or removed. Filters can be used to identify patterns in voltagemeasurements that describe particular equipment, or longer patterns of change that are characteristic ofa particular area.4.3.3 Micro timescale: millisecondsThis section examines the millisecond-timescale impacts of connecting loads to the network, and howthese are related to location in the electrical network.When a large, simple load is connected, it causes a drop in the voltage magnitude at the load. The\u2013 86 \u2013Chapter 4. Location in Low-Voltage Distribution Networksvoltage observed at the terminal will exhibit a change in the sine waveform amplitude, shown in Figure4.16. A second customer connected to the network will experience a similar change in voltage magnitudewhen the first load is connected.VoltageTimeSwitch eventVoltage change envelopetFigure 4.16: Voltage drop during switching eventThe figure shows a switching event at time t at peak voltage. The voltage decreases along the envelopeindicated by a dashed line.An observer at the customer terminals might be able to use this to verify the existence of a connectionbetween those customers: if there is a voltage magnitude change at exactly the same point on thewaveform, a common connection between them can be inferred. However, if this is not observed, it mightbe reasonable to conclude the customers have different supplies.In the three-phase power system, customers may be supplied by different phases. Single-phase loadingcauses unbalance, which can be observed on the other phases as a decrease or increase in voltage. Thechange happens at the point in time when the load is connected, but observations across different phaseswill show this change at a different point on the waveform due to the 120\u00b0phase shift.Similarly, this could be used to identify connection. As shown in Chapter 3, two connections onthe same phase will observe the magnitude change at the same time and same point on the waveform;connections on different phases will observe a small (positive or negative, depending upon phase andreactive power) magnitude change at the same time caused by unbalance.In some cases, the envelope may describe a fast change, but the characteristics of the line and loads maybe such that the voltage changes over the course of several cycles, as in Figure 4.16. Whilst attempts couldbe made to identify phase based on the point on the waveform at which change begins, this is challengingdue to the potential variation in equipment, noise, event timing and so forth, especially considering thelow magnitude of the voltage variation in question. Figure 4.17 shows a series of 5 cycles around aswitching event of a 1kW load - but pinpointing the exact moment of connection certainly cannot beperformed by inspection.The results from chapter 3 show the voltage change from additional loading to be no more than afew percent, and well below the +10, -6 % voltage rise/drop limits. There are many sources of noise in\u2013 87 \u20134.3.

The change in voltage results in a ramp inthe RMS voltage.

The correlation for VB is not stronglypositive, and its peak exhibits lag. The other measured voltages are omitted for clarity.When considering how to implement such a technique, further practicalities become apparent: it isnecessary for the sampling to be synchronised to between the observers. Whilst GPS receivers can be usedto provide timestamps accurate to microsecond-level, this functionality is not commonly implemented incommodity hardware. Consequently, voltage must be examined at the macro level. The next section willexplore how the network behaves over the course of seconds, minutes or hours and use these propertiesfor analysis.\u2013 91 \u20134.3. Location from electrical signals4.3.4 Macro timescale events: seconds and minutesOn the macro scale, it is useful to examine the RMS voltage and its behaviour over time. The voltagechanges over the course of a day, caused by a variety of power systems components including automaticvoltage regulation systems as well as customer loads connecting and disconnecting, with fluctuationslasting from under a second to cyclic daily phenomena. With the power system model described in Figure4.15, there will be local variations common to connected nodes \u2014 it is proposed that these variations beused as a fingerprinting method to determine the connection between customers.In the electrical network as described in 4.1.4, customers close to each other will experience a similarvoltage to each other; disconnected customers will have different profiles. There will be some differencein the former case \u2014 the loads and distribution lines will distort this signal.The cross-correlation of two RMS voltage signals over a common 24-hour time period will be used toassess the potential connection between nodes on the electrical network. The magnitude and the peakof the cross-correlation between the voltage signals measured by customers will give an indication of thesimilarity. A high peak at the midpoint suggests a very similar signal aligned to the same timebase, andindicates a common customer connection.Cross-correlation was used in [143] in a small residential network where the data on allocation of phaseconnection to a household was unavailable. The study sampled voltage at properties on the network,and performed the cross-correlation with a known three-phase reference location. The resulting serieswith the highest maximum was selected as a method to determine the phase of the house. However, inthe context of this research, a three-phase reference location is not available. The study also made noassessment of the phase shift indicated by the location of the maximum. Further, the case where nodesmay not be connected is not examined. .Voltage variations will occur as a result of daily, predictable consumption patterns. Control equipmentoperates to adjust the voltage in an area to maintain performance within acceptable limits \u2013 but the timingof operation of these items will vary from area to area. Filters can be used to attempt to improve thecross-correlation results: the use of a low-pass filter increases the visibility of daily variation and slowerpower system control responses. In particular, the cross-correlation between areas under the influence ofdifferent control equipment will exhibit a phase lag as their controllers intervene at different times. Thiswill be shown by a variation in the index of the peak away from the midpoint. Similarly, a highpassfilter can be used to exclude consumption patterns and control equipment, such that the magnitude ofthe peak of the cross-correlation will be more reflective of local variation.\u2013 92 \u2013Chapter 4. Location in Low-Voltage Distribution Networks4.3.5 Data collectionThe idealised models described in Chapter 3 contain neither noise nor power system events such astransformer tap changes. It is useful to use logged voltage measurements from a real power network toprovide a variety of events comprising different customer equipment operating on a noisy connection.OpenEnergyMonitor.org energy monitors were used to log the voltage at 10s (0.1Hz) resolution onthe legacy network Durham, UK, with the setup as per Figure 4.24.Figure 4.24: Datalogger setupDatalogger setup. The image shows the data hub (Raspberry Pi, left) with radio component visible;OpenEnergyMonitor datalogger (centre) and plug-in voltage transformer (right).Over the course of a three-week period, the voltage was logged in 4 properties, A-D. Three wereadjacent to each other (A,B,C), with two on the same phase (A,B) and one on a different phase (C).This was verified by measuring the voltages on a common timebase. The verification of the 120\u00b0 phasedifference in (A,C) can be seen in Figure 4.25. The fourth property (D) was in same city but on a differentpart of the network, approximately 2.6km away.Figure 4.25: Identifying phase for dataloggingAn oscilloscope was used to observe the voltage waveforms at properties A and C simultaneously to verifythe nature of the electrical connection between them; this figure shows the 120\u00b0 phase difference betweenthem.\u2013 93 \u20134.3.

Location from electrical signals4.3.6 Application and results4.3.6.1 FilteringLow- and high-pass filters were used to improve the ability to discriminate between connection types byisolating different kinds of variation, as per 4.3.4. The filters were designed in MATLAB[144] with theproperties in Table 4.2. These filters were then applied to the signals before cross-correlation.Type Filter Pass frequency Stop frequencyHigh-pass Equiripple FIR 2\u00d7 10\u22124Hz 0.5\u00d7 10\u22124HzLow-pass Equiripple FIR 0.5\u00d7 10\u22124Hz 2\u00d7 10\u22124HzTable 4.2: Filters for event isolationThe high-pass Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter removes frequencies with period greater than 1.5hours, so highlights (local) short-term variation; the low-pass FIR filter emphasises events longer than1.5 hours, more likely to be characteristic of the power system.4.3.6.2 Cross-correlationTo allow for analysis of different node pairs and remove the effect of individual voltage levels across thepower system, the offset in RMS voltage (approximately 230V) was removed from each time series, anda normalised cross-corelation was used in order to compare peak maxima. By doing so, the effect ofabsolute local voltage (which will depend upon factors such as the service cable properties) and of nodeproximity to a stiff grid is reduced. The variations in voltage will be smaller, but are normalised.The cross-correlation between the properties was performed in MATLAB[144] for each recorded 24-hour period for signal pairs (A,B), (A,C) and (C,D) to examine the phase-connected, feeder-connected,and disconnected cases. The three plots in Figure 4.28 show the (unfiltered) results for each pair.4.3.6.2.1 Peak MaximaThe first, Figure 4.28(a), shows a clear peak in the middle with a magnitude very close to 1. Fromthis, the voltage fluctuations in properties A and B are very similar. The peak in the middle shows thatno time-shifting is necessary for the maximum similarity between the signals \u2014 since they are recordedsimultaneously, this is to be expected.The second, Figure 4.28(b), shows a similar spike, although with a lower peak magnitude. The third,Figure 4.28(c), shows the disconnected case. There is still a higher value around the centre, althoughthe shoulders around the peak are wider than in the connected case, giving a weaker similarity than inFigure 4.28(b).\u2013 96 \u2013Chapter 4.

The central box is bounded by the upper and lower quartiles of the data, with the mean indicatedinside. The range of the data is shown by a dashed line. The box gives an indication of the shape of thedistribution including its skewness.The box plot in Figure 4.29 contains the distribution of daily peak magnitudes for each time seriesand each signal pair. There is very little variation for (A,B) - the range is less than 0.1%. The meanpeak magnitude is considerably lower for the other two cases. The connected case is clearly identifiable.The results of the cross-correlation after applying the filters are shown in Figure 4.30. The distributionfor the disconnected case shows higher magnitude as upstream power system characteristics become moresignificant.The high-pass filter results, shown in Figure 4.31, reduce the peak of the feeder-connected (A,C) case.This shows how the similarities are dominated by phase-balanced system behaviour rather than localconsumption \u2014 which is in line with the modelling in Chapter 3, where single-phase loading producesrelatively small interaction with other phases, and potentially contributing to negative correlation. Thechange, then, shows sufficient balanced low-frequency behaviour to discriminate between the cases wherethe nodes are connected to a common feeder and the disconnected case.\u2013 98 \u2013Chapter 4.

Location in Low-Voltage Distribution NetworksThe position of the peak in the phase-connected (A,B) cases are at 8641, i.e. the midpoint, but in(A,C) the values are distributed - although with the mean still the midpoint; and in (C,D) showingpotentially several minutes of delay from the others.In particular, the distribution for (C,D) in Figure 4.32(b) shows shows D leading C by intervals ofup to 1800 samples, or 30 minutes. With the low-pass filter applied, this is a clear demonstration of thecombination of differing network loading patterns and timing of voltage control equipment.For disconnected equipment, lead and lag are equally likely, so the important factor is the likelihoodof deviation from the midpoint. This particular distribution, then, shows the difference in the networkbut is only illustrative of the two network sections in question and does not reflect a general case. Rather,this may be better represented by a high probability of nonzero shift.Based on the descriptions of the effects of electrical network structure and equipment on cross-correlation in Section 4.3.4 and the observations in Section 4.3.6.2, descriptions of the cases may beconstructed; these are shown in Table 4.3.Connection Peak magnitude Peak Index High-Pass Filter effectFeeder connected, phase-connected very high at midpoint limited changeFeeder-connected, phase-disconnected medium around midpoint reduced peakDisconnected low (large deviations) limited changeTable 4.3: Connection identification matrixThese qualitative descriptions will require quantitative determination in order for them to be used.4.3.6.3 Hypothesis TestingThresholds must be determined for the descriptions in Table 4.3. In order to decide which category aresult falls into, the hypothesis testing described in 4.3.2.2 can be applied. Further work will be requiredto provide confidence in a generalised set of thresholds. However, the peak magnitudes of the feeder-disconnected, phase-disconnected case and the fully disconnected case show some overlap in the datagathered, so the decision threshold is developed for this case.4.3.6.3.1 ParametersThe value of the maximum of the cross-correlation function described above is a random variable. Simi-larly, the index of the maximum of the cross-correlation is a random variable.In the case of deciding between \u201cnodes connected to the same phase of a common feeder\u201d and \u201cnodesconnected to a different phase of a common feeder\u201d, the a priori probabilities can be assumed to be 13and 23 respectively, since there are three possible configurations: connected to the same phase, a leadingphase or a lagging phase. However, the relative probability of the disconnected case is not known inadvance.\u2013 103 \u20134.3. Location from electrical signals4.3.6.3.2 Peak MagnitudeSome skew is visible in the box plots in Figures 4.29-4.31, but the peak magnitudes will be modelled asnormally distributed.It is assumed at this point that the peak magnitude results are broadly indicative of the three cases- however, in the absence of further work regarding the sensitivity of the peak magnitude to networkproperties, the results for the filtered cases are more similar. The exact thresholds will vary; theydetermine and describe the \u201csphere of influence\u201d of both customer action and network components.Consequently, the unfiltered data (Figure 4.29) is used, showing the distinction between the disconnectedand the connected case.To fit a normal distribution to the (unfiltered) data, then, the following properties for are calculated:Connection Mean \u00b5 Standard deviation \u03c3(A,C) - feeder-connected 0.520 0.124(C,D) - disconnected 0.327 0.096Table 4.4: Distribution propertiesFitting the normal distribution with these parameters provides the PDFs shown in Figure 4.33.0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.900.020.040.060.080.10.120.140.160.18Peak magnitude (normalised)Probability  Figure 4.33: Connection PDFsThe figure shows the probability density functions of the disconnected (left) and feeder-connected (right)cases.\u2013 104 \u2013Chapter 4. Location in Low-Voltage Distribution NetworksThe hypotheses in this case are:H0: Nodes are disconnectedH1: Nodes are connected to common feeder(4.13)There is a cost associated with an incorrect decision: a false detection will result in controller actionthat will not achieve its objectives; a false negative will exclude the controller from taking action whereit could provide support. The cost of excess action, however, is more significant. Rather than attemptingto use cost functions, this preference is reflected in the choice of a low false alarm rate of 0.05.Following the definition of a gaussian distribution, the a posteriori probabilities are:p(x) =1\u221a2pi\u03c3e\u2212(x\u2212\u00b5)22\u03c32 (4.14)The decision threshold for a given false alarm rate, then, is the boundary of the region described byEquation 4.12. Consequently,P (D1|H0) = 0.05 =\u222bR1p0(x)dx =\u222b \u221e\u03b31\u221a2pi\u03c3e\u2212(x\u2212\u00b5)22\u03c32 dx (4.15)Substituting \u00b5 and \u03c3 from 4.4,\u03b3 = 0.485 (4.16)For any peak magnitude measurement x \u2264 \u03b3, the disconnected case will be assumed.4.3.7 Proof of ConceptWith the macro-timescale properties described qualitatively in 4.3.4, the quantitative parameters werederived using real data in Section 4.3.6. In order to verify the approach, the parameters can be recalculatedfor the connections of nodes A-D in Section 4.3.5 to establish repeatability.Verification must be performed on data not used in the original derivation. An additional 24-hourdataset was collected from locations A-D with the method decribed in Section 4.3.5. These four signalsare shown in Figure 4.34.The methods described in Sections 4.3.4 - 4.3.6 were applied. The cross-correlation between signalswas calculated using MATLAB for each pair in A-D (i.e. 12 pairs, excluding same-node pairs). Thenormalised peak magnitude and peak index were recorded. These are shown in the matrix in Table 4.5.\u2013 105 \u20134.3. Location from electrical signalst (Seconds)0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 70,000 80,000Voltage (RMS)230235240245250255260265270ABCDFigure 4.34: 24h recorded time seriesThe figure shows the verification dataset: RMS voltage measured at locations A-D recorded at 10sintervals to a common 24-hour timebase.By comparing the results with the thresholds developed in Section 4.3.6, an adjacency matrix maybe formed, shown in Table 4.6. In this case, the peak index occurs at the mid-point for the D cases;it still clearly falls into the disconnected category. The adjacency matrix is then used to create the fullconnection graph, as shown in Figure 4.35A B C DA - 0.97, 8641 0.78, 8665 0.33, 8641B 0.97, 8641 - 0.74, 8665 0.36, 8642C 0.78, 8617 0.74, 8617 - 0.33, 8641D 0.33, 8641 0.36, 8640 0.33, 8641 -Table 4.5: Proof-of-concept: trial resultsThe dataset shows the normalised peak magnitude (0-1) and the peak index (1-17281) of the cross-correlation of recorded node voltagesA B C DA - phase feeder disconnectedB phase - feeder disconnectedC feeder feeder - disconnectedD disconnected disconnected disconnected -Table 4.6: Proof-of-concept: adjacency matrix resultThe results are translated into connection properties through the developed thresholds and given herefor each non-self pair. Note that this figure indicates the same connections indicated in Figure 4.26.When compared with the known connection properties of nodes A-D as shown in Table 4.1 and Figure4.26, these results confirm successful use of the electrical identification techniques developed.\u2013 106 \u2013Chapter 4.

The prop-erties of the connections are indicated by the text by the connecting edges.These properties can be used to construct a path for voltage control (see Figure 4.6) and a star (ortree) for current control (see Figure 4.5). A node will calculate the cross-correlation between itself andpotential neighbours. Beginning from node A, then, a path and a star can be constructed from theseproperties, as shown in Figure 4.36: Figure 4.36(a) shows the path and Figure 4.36(b) shows the star.Importantly, the edge between B and C is not visible in Figure 4.36(b): no assessment is made of theconnection between the two nodes by A, since as the number N of neighbours grows, the number of cross-correlations to be calculated increases with N2 and rapidly become a significant burden for calculation.However, the node\u2019s own internal representation still carries information about which nodes are connectedto it.A BPhase & feeder \u2013 0.97(a) Voltage control: pathABCFeeder \u20130.78 Phase & feeder \u2013 0.97(b) Current control: starFigure 4.36: Electrically-derived graphs for Node AThis technique, then, has been shown to correctly identify the location properties (as shown in Figure\u2013 107 \u20134.4. Final location consolidation4.35) and to be used in graph structures for internal representation of connection properties (as shownin Figure 4.36). The geographical and electrical approaches must be combined: Section 4.4 provides asummary of the complete approach.4.4 Final location consolidationA final graph can constructed by combining all these data: Firstly, the geographical approach selectslikely candidates. The measured signals are then analysed: a confirmation of the phase-connected casefor voltage control can be obtained with a lower threshold for peak magnitude of 0.9. The node is thusincorporated into the path graph with the structure from the geographical tree creation process (seeSection 4.2.1. The feeder-connected attribute can be used to create a star graph suitable for currentcontrol: if the phase connection is not shown, further analysis is performed: as shown above, the criteriafor inclusion as sharing a feeder are both the index of the peak occurring near the midpoint of thecross-correlation, and a peak magnitude above \u03b3 = 0.485; otherwise, it is added to a list of disconnectednodes. The node is thus incorporated into the graph, and the edge weighted with the 3-tuple (distance,connection type, peak magnitude) to distinguish the overlay of voltage/current graphs and the connectionquality.For the purposes of this work, the initial approach the voltage control task will only necessitate thephase-connected (i.e. path) graph.4.5 ConclusionThe importance of location was discussed in Section 4.1. New concepts of location in the electricalnetwork are discussed and location analogues and sources of location data are explored. A geographicalapproach was outlined to derive location information, and a new method was presented using distancesand tree walks for using this information in creating a network graph suitable for use by a control system.The properties of the electrical network were explored as a source for location data; signals were capturedfrom the live power system and then used to establish the real-world validity of a novel, non-intrusivemethod of confirming the existence and nature of connection between points on a network. The modelcan consequently be used in both voltage and current control, and is derived from locally availableinformation. The combined new geographical approach, electrical analysis and graphing method willbe taken forward as key functionality in the implementation of a location-learning multi-agent controlsystem to be described in Chapter 5.\u2013 108 \u2013Chapter 5Multi-Agent Systems for LVDNControlThis chapter contains the implementation of location-based control for Low-Voltage Distribution Net-works (LVDNs) using a novel real-time test rig.The impacts of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) on LVDNs are described in the literature (seeSection 2.2.1) and Chapter 3 outlined models incorporating them to demonstrate these effects. Thischapter details a Multi-Agent System (MAS) approach as a means to tackling those technical challenges.The design and testing of this system required new facilities. The development of multi-agent testbedsis described in Section 5.2 and voltage control agents were applied that use the techniques developed inprevious chapters to demonstrate the capabilities of those new facilities.A review of MAS theory is presented at the start of this chapter, where decentralisation is examinedas both challenge and tool in electrical network control. It introduces concepts of multi-agent systemsand cognitive models of agents. Existing paradigms of (non-) hierarchical societies of agents are describedthrough the lens of distributed control systems. Existing and new approaches are described for groupproblem solving through communication. Formal descriptions of agent attitudes are used to describeand critique intention and the new technique of Intention Transfer is presented as a decentralised opt-incollaboration tool.In Section 5.2.2, the novel control agents developed to address the research problem are outlinedalong with the components of the MAS software platform used. Three original MAS test bed hardwareimplementations are described: a proof-of-concept system, a cluster supercomputer implementation, anda unique electrical network/control software/hardware-in-loop platform.The results of the system operating on the network models are given in Section 5.3. The performanceof the location-based control approach is examined over the course of the development of the project.\u2013 109 \u20135.1. Multi-Agent SystemsFinally, the novel approach against the problem statement is evaluated alongside the features of the newtest facilities developed to demonstrate it.5.1 Multi-Agent Systems5.1.1 Agent ConceptAgents are widely described as autonomous, proactive, reactive (and, often, social) entities. They mightbe software programs, humans or hardware articles with these properties. Agents reason (at varying levelsof complexity) and make decisions for themselves based on their own knowledge. They will actively seekto achieve or maintain a particular state or to solve a problem. They might change operational strategiesto do so if necessary. Agents may adjust and adapt to external changes, creating a closed-loop feedbackapproach to affecting their environment. It is often expedient for agents to communicate directly in orderto share information, negotiate or achieve a better solution through collaboration. In some cases, agentsare capable of learning, or exhibiting intelligence.Multiple autonomous, reactive, proactive and social software entities acting on the same domain canbe referred to as a Multi-Agent System (MAS).In software, MAS is a programming approach that uses independent software entities to performactions and communicate to achieve some functionality. Multi-agent systems are distinct from mono-lithic (single-agent) programming, in which one piece of software has complete control over all of thesystem inputs and outputs, and the client-server model where resources are centralised and accessed in ahierarchical fashion.Multi-Agent Systems have been used to create robust, resilient and effective systems in many indus-tries, such as manufacturing and telecommunications. In some applications, agents are used for modellingrather than acting upon a physical system, for example by representing human behaviours in order toestablish emergent system-wide phenomena. There are platforms and toolkits for agent software devel-opment in different applications, standards for information exchange, and proposals and specificationsspecific to power engineering.In the power systems domain, agents could be control routines, monitoring devices or a proxy for aconsumer; in this way, the multi-agent system becomes analogous to the electricity system itself, witheach element represented in some fashion by a connected agent. Communication of information aboutthe state of the distribution network, independent decisionmaking, and negotiation allows deduction ofrational, relevant control actions.\u2013 110 \u2013Chapter 5. Multi-Agent Systems for LVDN Control5.1.2 Multi-Agent Systems in Power SystemsMulti-Agent Systems have been applied in power systems from generation, transmission, distribution,supply and domestic control. The review by McArthur et al. [115] discusses distribution network ap-plications in protection, network monitoring, and simulation, and highlight that distributed control is aparticular focus for MAS research[115].In particular, the following topics have all been addressed using agent functionality:\u0088 thermal overloading of transformers\u0088 voltage rise and drop\u0088 voltage regulation\u0088 voltage unbalance\u0088 cable thermal limits\u0088 frequency control\u0088 islanding\u0088 enabling DSM\u0088 market participation\u0088 maintenance planning\u0088 topology reconfigurationThe properties of agents are evidently appropriate for the power systems domain. Distributed controlapproaches are of interest: purely autonomous agents can operate to create an emergent control system,such as in [145]. However, currently underexploited is the social aspect of agents in control, at least inpart because of the timing requirements for different control goals[1] as well as the difficulties of reliablecommunication. As an approach to the research problem, then, the social and communicative aspects ofmulti-agent systems may be exploited to improve LV network behaviour.In constructing a multi-agent system, it is useful to understand how an agent can make rationaldecisions: to this end, there are several cognitive models of an agent that can be used to create rulesand programmes that result in an entity exhibiting behaviour of the type described above. The followingsection describes appropriate modelling, which is used later in the chapter to develop reasoning andcommunication approaches.5.1.3 Distributed, Decentralised, Devolved ControlControl could be considered to be distributed either by a distributed algorithm (i.e. performance of ashared algorithm by multiple participants), or by changing hierarchies in decisionmaking and action.Hierarchy manifests in the degree to which an agent will obey another, and the autonomy or initiative\u2013 111 \u20135.1. Multi-Agent Systemsan agent possesses to achieve an objective. A hybrid of the two is devolution, where some centrally deter-mined requirement or goal in a hierarchical organisation of agents is achieved by passing the responsibilityfor determining a solution and its implementation to lower-level, locally-relevant agents. Often, however,any combination of these ideas is simply called \u201cdecentralisation\u201d, being any system that does not usesome form of service-oriented or client-server model.Different systems of organising agents will result in varying hierarchy and autonomy.5.1.4 CommunicationThe MAS paradigm involves independent (software) entities which operate autonomously in order toachieve individual goals. However, individual- or system-level goals may be hard or impossible to achievewhere only individual actions are available. Agents may work together through communication in orderto achieve these goals. The literature is approached from the perspective of the electrical power systemsdomain, with the aim of identifying techniques that may be useful and transferable to distribution networkcontrol.5.1.5 Cognitive Models of AgentsIt is useful to consider the internal structure of a software agent to assist understanding of its operationand to facilitate implementation. From the outside, agents are considered to be \u201cblack boxes\u201d. Agentsare usually unaware of the internal structure of other agents and how this relates to their behaviour. A\u201ccognitive model\u201d is a description of an agent\u2019s subsystems that a programmer can use to design how itresponds to stimulus in order to simplify its construction. There are several ways to describe the \u201cmind\u201dof an agent \u2014 existing models include BDI, CLARION, DUAL and others. Much like a programminglanguage, the choice of analysis model is partly an implementation choice with some advantages to each.For reasons of familiarity, the Beliefs, Desires, Intentions (BDI) model is used here.The BDI cognitive model[146] provides a way to compartmentalise agent reasoning systems. A complexagent is broken down into a knowledge base (beliefs), a set of goals the agent may wish to achieve (desires),and, having decided to act, a commitment to a set of actions the agent may take to actually achieve them(intentions).Separation in this way allows an agent to perform reasoning about each of these discrete componentsand make decisions about them, such as whether it is feasible to take a certain action, or whether itbelieves a goal has been achieved. This facilitates the internal decision-making process.In the electrical domain, then, an EV controller agent could be modelled in this way: with a setof beliefs (e.g. the current battery status), desires (e.g. \u2018a full EV battery\u2019 or\u2018\u2019minimise the cost ofcharging) and intentions (e.g. \u2018charge the EV battery\u2019). This informs the construction of the variousfunctions (sensing, evaluation, and action routines) that make up the overall controller.\u2013 112 \u2013Chapter 5. Multi-Agent Systems for LVDN ControlFunctions such as communication interpretation and goal management can be placed alongside theBDI model to allow the agent to select its behaviour and perform social functions. An agent may possessconflicting desires, but must not rationally attempt to enact incompatible intentions simultaneously.Intentions are implemented at the lowest level by choosing an appropriate plan (sometimes known as arecipe) from a library of functions which could perform a physical or communicative act. Beliefs onlyreflect the agent\u2019s (incomplete) knowledge about the world it inhabits, and may be incorrect or out ofdate. The terms goal and desire are used interchangeably here.Cohen and Levesque [147] describe a domain of possible worlds, each connected by sequence of non-overlapping events which occur along some temporal index. An agent (with incomplete information) mayinhabit a world compatible with its perceptions. The agent can make a transition to a compatible world(including the current world) at some other point on the temporal index, linked by its beliefs and goals;the latter are expressed as choices. Between two consecutive points on the temporal index, an event mayoccur which changes the state of the world that an agent perceives that it inhabits. This event may alsoalter the accessibility of other worlds.Cohen and Levesque use a modal logic representation to describe agents; agent beliefs; goals, intentionsand other mental attitudes; information and communication; truth propositions; and how choices andactions affect the real world. Modal logic notation is used throughout this thesis.In a communicative agent society, multiple agents could operate upon their environments simultane-ously to achieve their goals. Some similar goals might be held by multiple agents \u2014 in this context, thiscould be an overall control scheme. The following sections discuss forms of interaction between agents tocreate group actions.5.1.6 Agent CollaborationAgent interaction can be used to achieve a goal, whether locally decided or globally designed. Agents maycooperate and work together to achieve a common goal. The notion of \u201cjoint action\u201d (and correspondingly,joint intention, see Section 5.1.10.2) involves two or more agents operating simultaneously towards acommon goal, but more importantly incorporates an element of belief that other agents are also actingto achieve the same ends[148]. This requires explicit communication of these beliefs. Other concepts incooperative action include the formation of interdependent plans, where agents share a common solutionand members execute the relevant components[149].However, the application of a common goal and its representation in a devolved agent-based systemis problematic. An agent may be willing to cooperate, but be unable to do so due to some operationalconstraint. Or, it may cooperate, but know that doing so is to the detriment of the requesting agent.This can be a particular issue where agents only perceive their immediate environment but can formbeliefs about the rest of the world through communication. Other approaches, such as competition or\u2013 113 \u20135.1. Multi-Agent Systemsmarket-driven negotiation may be redundant or irrelevant in the context.The following section explores systems of organisation as a means to achieve joint action in multi-agentsocieties.5.1.7 Organisational ParadigmsAgent societal structure has a significant impact on the effectiveness of groups of agents at solvingparticular tasks[150]. These structures have strengths and weaknesses and there are differences in theway these groups are formed. Some structures could promote altruistic or competitive cooperation; othersmay restrict agent interactions dependent upon location or function. Table 5.1.7 gives a summary of thekey types, strengths and weaknesses the various structures. Whilst coalition has a specific meaningdescribed below, it is more generally a group that agrees to attempt a common goal; other structures areeffectively special cases of coalitions.5.1.7.1 SocietyThe finite set of agents N from Definition 1 is a society ; however, society has properties not expressed inthis model of a game. As well as a set of agents, society incorporates ideas of conventions for interactions.In the society, agents must act according to these social laws; a society may enforce these laws withpenalties such as fines or exclusion. These can be used to create a particular behaviour, for example ina microgrid where a customer may not draw more than 5kW on pain of having supply cut off. Sociallaws and norms (for example, electricity unit trading in pounds sterling) form part of the environmentthe agents exist in. However, these laws require representation or internalisation within agents if theyare to exploit cooperation or coordination[151]. Hierarchy, distribution and autonomy are properties ofan agent society that are partly resultant from social laws and norms, but also derive from the choice oforganisational paradigm used to achieve a task.5.1.7.2 CoalitionAny subset S of a society N can be a coalition. A coalition is a set of agents formed to solve a specificgoal. They are formed dynamically and are only relevant whilst the goal is maintained. Coalitions maybe formed whether agents are cooperative or self-interested. Self-interested rational agents will only joina coalition if the resulting payout is individually fair, that is, no worse than if the agent acted alone.Whilst a coalition is a flat structure, there may be hierarchies within it; coalitions may be nested, or oneagent may have some centralising or coordinating role. A leading agent may be decided by an electionbetween the agents before action, or determined by the nature of the goal to be fulfilled. Horling andLesser give the example of a deadline negotiated by a coalition leader, rather than by its componentagents[150]. Coalitions have similarities with federations described below, but federations have a distinctand persistent facilitator role. Coalitions formed from a society must have common communication and\u2013 114 \u2013Chapter 5. Multi-Agent Systems for LVDN Controlzation exists for any situation, due the inevitable tradeoffsthat must be made and the uncertainty, lack of global co-herence and dynamism present in any realistic population(Romelaer, 2002). What is clear is that all approacheshave different characteristics which may be more suitablefor some problems and less suitable for others. Orga-nizations can be used to limit the scope of interactions,provide strength in numbers, reduce or manage uncer-tainty, reduce or explicitly increase redundancy or formal-ize high-level goals which no single agent may be awareof (Lesser and Corkill, 1981; Fox, 1981). At the sametime, organizations can also adversely affect computa-tional or communication overhead, reduce overall flexibil-ity or reactivity, and add an additional layer of complex-ity to the system (Horling et al., 2004). By discoveringand evaluating these characteristics, and then encodingthem using an explicit representation (Fox et al., 1998),one can facilitate the process of organizational-self design(Corkill and Lesser, 1983) whereby a system automatesthe process of selecting and adapting an appropriate orga-nization dynamically (Lesser, 1998; Schwaninger, 2000).This approach will ultimately enable suitably equippedagent populations to organize themselves, eliminating atleast some of the need to exhaustively determine all pos-sible runtime conditions a priori. Before this can occur,the space of organizational options must be mapped, andtheir relative benefits and costs understood.These benefits and costs, and the potential advantagesthat could be provided by technologies able to make useof such knowledge, motivate the need to determine thecharacteristics of organizations and under what circum-stances they are appropriate. While no two organizationalinstances are likely to be identical, there are identifiableclasses of organizations which share common character-istics (Romelaer, 2002). Several organizational paradigmssuitable for multi-agent systems have emerged from thisline of research (Fox, 1981). These cover particularlycommon, useful or interesting structures that can be de-scribed in some general form. In this paper we will de-scribe several of these paradigms, give some insight intohow they can be used and generated, and compare theirstrengths and weaknesses. The vast amount of researchwhich has been done in this field precludes a completesurvey of any one technique; we hope to provide thereader with a concise description and a sample of the in-teresting work that has been done in each area.Figure 1: A hierarchical organization.In the following sections, we will describe the origin,form, function and characteristics of a typical structurefor each organizational paradigm. Example applicationswill be presented, along with a discussion of techniquesthat have been employed to create the structures. By sep-arating these concepts, we will distinguish between thecharacteristics of the organization generation process andthose of the organizational structure itself, independentlyof how it was generated.2 HierarchiesThe hierarchy or hierarchical organization is perhaps theearliest example of structured, organizational design ap-plied to multi-agent system and earlier distributed artifi-cial intelligence architectures (Fox, 1979; Lesser and Er-man, 1980; Fox, 1981; Davis and Smith, 1983; Bond andGasser, 1988; Malone and Smith, 1988; Montgomery andDurfee, 1993). Agents are conceptually arranged in a tree-like structure, as seen in Figure 1, where agents higher inthe tree have a more global view than those below them.In its strictest interpretation, interactions do not take placeacross the tree, but only between connected entities. Morerecent work (Mathieu et al., 2002) has explored startingwith a strict hierarchy and augmenting it with cross linksto allow more direct communication, which can reducesome of the latency that results from repeated traversalsup and down the tree.The data produced by lower-level agents in a hier-archy typically travels upwards to provide a broaderview, while control flows downward as the higher levelagents provide direction to those below (Bond and Gasser,2(a) Hierarchyrather than the short-term contracts it has been typicallyused for more recently. The hierarchical structure that isproduced by the process is implicitly based on the waythe high-level goal can be decomposed. Upon receipt of anew task, an agent first chooses to perform the task itself,or search for agents willing to help complete the task. Aspart of this search process, the agent may decompose thetask into subtasks or contracts. The agent, acting as a con-tractor, announces these contracts along with a bid specifi-cation to a subset of its peers who then decide if they wishto submit a bid. The bids which return to the contrac-tor contain relevant information about the potential con-tractee which allows it to discriminate among competingoffers. A contractee is selected and notified. Upon receiptof the new task, the contractee now faces the same ques-tion - should it perform the task itself or contract it out?Repeated invocations of this process produce a hierarchyof contractors and contractees. Because agents individ-ually choose which contracts to bid on, and contractorschoose which bids to accept, this strategy can effectivelyassign tasks among a population of agents without theneed for a global view. The drawback to this approach isthat it is myopic. Because the contracting agent does notnecessarily take into account the needs of other contrac-tors, it may bin sc rce resource in suboptimal ways. Forexample, it may select a particular bid when viable alter-natives exist, even though that particular bidder is criticalto another agent (Sims et al., 2003).As with most organizational structures, the shape of thehierarchy can affect the characteristics of both global andlocal b haviors. A very flat hierarchy wher agents havea high degree of connectivity can lead to overloading ifagent resources are both limited and consumed as a re-sult of these connections. Conversely, a very tall struc-ture may slow the system\u2019s performance because of thedelays incurred by passing information across multiplelevels. One approach to making this tradeoff is the useof agent cloning (Ishida et al., 1992; Decker et al., 1997;Maturana et al., 1999). An agent in such a system mayopt to create a copy or clone of itself, possessing the samecapabilities as the original, in response to overloaded con-ditions. If additional resources are available for this clonet use, this proc ss allow the agent to dynamically cre-ate an assistant that can relieve excess burden from theoriginal, reducing load-related errors or inefficiencies inthe process. If the new agent is subordinate to t e origi-Figure 2: A holarchical organization.nal, then a hierarchical organization will be formed in theprocess. Shehory (Shehory et al., 1998) discusses usingcloning when other task-reallocation strategies are not vi-able. In this work, an agent\u2019s overall load is a functionof its local processing, free memory and communication.It uses a dynamic programming technique to compute anoptimal time to clone, and an appropriately idle computa-tional node to house the new agent. The clone receives asubset of the original task(s). The clones themselves re-quire resources, and the results they produce may requirean additional hop to get to their ultimate destination, sothey may also be merged or destroyed when these costsoutweigh their benefits.3 HolarchiesThe term holon was first coined by Arthur Koestler inhis book The Ghost In The Machine (Koestler, 1967). Inthis work, Koestler attempts to present a unified, descrip-tive theory of physical systems based on the nested, self-similar organization that many such systems possess. Forexample, biological, astrological and social systems areall comprised of multi-leveled, grouped hierarchies. Auniverse is comprised of a number of galaxies, which arecomprised of a number of solar systems, and so on, all theway down to subatomic particles. Each grouping in thesesystems has a character derived but distinct from the enti-ties that are members of the group. At the same time, this4(b) HolarchyAssuming it is possible to encode the social laws in away that makes them intelligible to agents, one still facesthe challenge of determining what conventions shouldbe enacted. Fitoussi (Fitoussi and Tennenholtz, 2000)presents a notion of minimal social laws, where he ar-gues that one should choose the smallest and simplest setof norms th t address the needs of th society. This isconsistent with the tradeoff between flexibility and com-plexity mentioned above. Work has also been done ex-ploring the dynamic emergence of norms, for when so-cial laws cannot specified off-line or if there is a desirefor the corpus to be responsive t changing conditions(Axelrod, 1986; Hewitt, 1986). Walk r and Wooldridge(Walker and Wooldridge, 1995) propose and evaluate anumber of ways that a group of agents can reach normconsensus based on locally available information.Dellarocas defines the act of an agent entering a soci-ety to be the socialization process (Dellarocas and Klein,1999). In that work, they suggest this can be accom-plished through an explicit negotiation process betweenthe agent and a representative of the society, as shownin the left side of Figure 6. This exchange results in asocial contract, or an explicit agreement made betweenthe agent and the society indicating the conditions underwhich the agent may join that society. This allows thepossibility of capable agents dynamically learning, andpotentially negotiating over, the rules it must abide byin that society. Lo\u00b4pez y Lo\u00b4pez (y Lo\u00b4pez et al., 2004),present a framework in which the facilities for norm rea-soning needed to support these behaviors can take place.A similar view is taken by Glaser in (Glaser and Morig-not, 1998), with the additional stipulation that the joiningagent must increase the utility of the society. This nat-urally extends to multi-society environments, where anagent\u2019s skills and goals define how good a fit it is witha particular society. Some of the challenges associatedwith operating in multi-society environments seem to becompar ble, though larger in scale, to those encounteredduring coalition or congregation formation.Because of their inherent flexibility, a great deal of ad-ditional complexity may be associated with social orga-nizations. Sophisticated legal systems, communicationbr dges, ontolog es, exception hand ing services, directo-ries may all be part of the society model (Dellarocas andKlein, 1999; Dignum, 2003; Klein et al., 2003). Some orall of these may be directly instantiated by trusted agentsFigure 7: An agent federation.taking on s -called facilitation roles (differentiated fromthe operational roles taken on by worker agents). Ofcourse, agents acting in the society must have a certainlevel of sophistication to know how and when to use suchservices. An interestin almost-par dox exis s in t re-lationship. Alt ough the society exists in part to reducethe complexity burden imposed on the participants, theparticipants must raise their level of complexity to takeadvantage of these benefits. In the case where interac-tions with some or all social services are mandatory (e.g.legal or arbitration services), this additional complexity issimilarly unavoidable and can act as a barrier to entry.8 FederationsAgent federations, or federated systems, come in manydifferent varieties. All share the common characteristicof a group of agents which have ceded some amount ofautonomy to a single delegate which represents the group(Wiede hold et al., 1992; Gen sereth, 1997). This orga-nizational style is modeled on the governmental systemof the same name, where regional provinces retain someamount of local autonomy while operating under a singlecentral government. The delegate is a distinguished agentmember of the group, som time called a facilitator, me-diator or broker (Sycara et al., 1997; Hayden et al., 1999).Group members interact only with this agent, which actsas an intermediary between the group and the outsideworld, as shown in Figure 7. In that figure each group-ing is a federate, and the white agent situ ted at the edgeof each federate is the delegated intermediary. Typically,the intermediate accepts skill and need descriptions fromthe local agents, which it uses to match with requests from15(c) FederationFigure 5: Congregations of agents.task. By recognizing these interrelationships, and sharingknowledge of what goals are being pursued, agents grad-ually build an internal model of how their actions mayaffect others. This knowledge is similar to that createdby the more formal joint intentions of STEAM, and al-lows agents to influence local behavior and communicateresults as if they were members of a common team.6 Congr gationsSimilar to coalitions and teams, agent congregations aregroups of individuals who have banded together into atypically flat organization in order to derive additionalbenefits. Unlike these other paradigms, congregations areassumed to be long-lived and are not formed with a singlespecific goal in mind. Instead, congregations are formedamong gents with similar or complementary characteris-tics to facilitate the process of finding suitable collabora-tors, as m deled in Figure 5. The different shadings in thisfigure represent the potentially heterogeneous purpose be-hind each grouping, in comparison to the typically morehomogeneous coalitions in Figure 3. Individual agents donot ecessarily have a single or fixed goal, but do havea st ble set of capabilities or requirements which moti-vat the need to congregate (Brooks et al., 2000; Griffiths,2003). Analogou human structures include clubs, sup-port groups, secretarial pools, academic departments andreligious groups, from which the name is derived.C ngregating agents are expected to be individually ra-tional, by maximizing their local long-term utility. Groupor global rewards are not used in this formalism (Brookset al., 2000). It is this desire to increase local utility whichdrives congregation selection, because it is the utility thatcan be provided by a congregation\u2019s (potential) membersthat determine how useful it is to the agent. Agents maycome and go dynamically over the existence of the con-gregation, although clearly there must be a relatively sta-ble number of participants for it to be useful. Agents mustalso take enough advantage of the congregation so thatthat the time and energy invested in forming and findingthe group is outweighed by the benefits derived from it.Since congregations are formed in large part to reduce thecomplexity of search and limit interactions, communica-tion does not occur between agents in different congrega-tions, although the groups are not necessarily disjoint (i.e.,an agent can be a member of multiple congregations). Thenet result of the congregating behavior is an arrangementthat can produce greater average utility per cycle spentcomputing or communicating (Brooks and Durfee, 2002).6.1 CharacteristicsAlthough congregations can theoretically share many ofthe same benefits of coalitions, their function in currentresearch has been to facilitate the discovery of agent part-ners by restricting the size of the population that must besearched. As a secondary effect these groupings can alsoincrease utility or reliability by creating tighter couplingsbetween agents in the same congregation, typically byimposing higher penalties for decommitment or increas-ing information sharing among congregating peers. Thedownside to this strategy is that the limited set may beoverly restrictive, and not contain the optimal agents onemight interact with given infinite resources. So, in form-ing the congregation, one is trading off quality and flex-ibility for a reduction in time, complexity or cost. If anappropriate balance can be found, this will result in a netgain in utility.This hypothesis is borne out in the experiments froman information economy domain (Brooks and Durfee,2002). This work varied the number of congregationsthat agents were allowed to form. Since the populationsize was static, the average congregation size decreased asthe number of congregations increased. The accumulatedquality decreased proportionally because of less flexibil-ity in agent interactions. However, these smaller congre-gations also incurred lower overhead, and thus had lesscost. A median point was discovered in the space whichproduced maximum value.11(d) CongregationFigure 5.1: Organisational StructuresFour key organis tional Stru ures (reproduced from [150]) incorporating aspects of hierarchy, delegation,independence and collabora ion.Paradigm Key characteristic Benefits DrawbacksHiera chy Decomposition M ps to many com on domain ;may scale wellPotentially britt ; can lead tobottlenecks or delaysHolarchy Decompositionwith autonomyExploits autonomy of functionalunitsMust organise holons; lack ofpredicatable performanceCoalition Dynamic, goal-directedExploits strength in numbers Short-term benefits may not out-weigh organisation constructioncostsTeam Group-lev l cohe-sionAddresses larger gr ined prob-lems; task-centricIncreased communicationCongregation Long-lived, utilitydirectedFacilitates agent discovery Sets may be overly restrictiveSociety Open system Public services; well-defined con-ventionsPotentially complex; agents mayrequire additional s ciety-relatedcapabilitiesFederatio Middle agents Matchmaking, brokering, trans-lation services; facilitates dy-namic agent po lIntermediaries become bottle-necksMarket Competitionthrough pricingGood at allocation increased util-ity through ce tr lisation; in-creased fairne s throug biddingPotential for collusion, maliciousbehaviour; allocation decisionc mplexity can be highMatrix Mul iple man-agersResource sh r ; multiply influ-enced agentsPotential for conflicts; need forincreased agent sophisticatioCo pound Concurrent organ-isationsExploits benefits of several organ-is tio al stylesIncreased sophistication; draw-backs of several organisationalstylesTable 5.1: Organisationsal ParadigmsComparing the qualities of various organisation paradigms (reproduced from [150]).\u2013 115 \u20135.1. Multi-Agent Systemsnegotiation capabilities, whereas federations may be used to interface between incompatible groups.5.1.7.3 HierarchyIn a hierarchy, agents are arranged in the structure in Fig. 5.1(a) which shows a directed graph whereinstructions from higher levels are passed to nodes (agents) at lower levels. These relationships aretypically determined a priori and are related to the functional role of heterogeneous agents. Whilstinstructions from higher levels are obeyed by those lower down, there is often scope for agents responsiblefor implementation to act autonomously to determine how the instructions should be fulfilled from itsarray of capabilities.Hierarchies can be used to improve scalability by dividing agents into smaller groups, each with acontroller. No single agent is directly responsible for too many others. However, this architecture can bebrittle: nodes become single points of failure.Data flows back up the graph to assist the decisionmaking agents. There is a trade-off to be madeabout which data are passed up to higher levels; more data can result in better decisions, but as data isaggregated up progressive levels, the communication requirements may rapidly become a burden.A role-based approach can be used to explicitly represent hierarchical relationships, as well as socialconstraints imposed on agent actions[152]. Barbuceanu rejects the necessity of mutual goals in thecontext of multiple subordinates working on subtasks whilst ignorant of a supertask and criticises thejoint intention model as overly restrictive in the communication required to abandon a commitment;however, he does not consider the subtask as the joint goal held with a supervisor. In this highly-decomposed hierarchical structure, the agreements comprise two participants only. Goals and plansto act are created dynamically by inference from communication and the predetermined obligations,permissions and interdictions inherited from a defined social role.In other contexts, however, the obligation to act derived from hierarchy results in a rational plan toact, adopt joint intention or otherwise collaborate: the penalty for not obeying hierarchy may be explicitlyrepresented in a utility function, or an agent\u2019s reasoning functions may include \u201chierarchy rationality\u201d aswell as economic rationality. As with Distributed Problem Solving (DPS), individual economic functionsmay not be relevant.5.1.7.4 CongregationThe congregation grouping characteristic \u2014 Fig. 5.1(d) \u2014 is modelled after human interactions. Thecongregation is a group that persists in time (unlike a coalition) to perform a function. The functionitself is one important facet (such as common religious practice, after which it is named), although otheraspects \u2014 such as the location of the members, are also significant. Even virtual congregations may havea form of location, such as the campaigning group 38 Degrees which organises online, often in subsets of its\u2013 116 \u2013Chapter 5. Multi-Agent Systems for LVDN Controlmembership. In the power systems domain, microgrids tend not to use this structure: whilst microgridsmay include clustering of participants, even in a single forum (i.e. a market interface), the activity isusually for trading between individuals, rather than achieving a common goal. Congregation examplesmight be more readily found in Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) where a number of participants combineefforts to provide a particular service, presented externally as a single effort through an aggregator.The persistance and commonality of a congregation allows its members to improve performance of thetask of identifying collaborators by reducing the search space to suitable partners. If partner selectionhas cost, this may increase utility by selecting counterparts with a higher likelihood of more successfulcooperation. Agents in congregations maintain individual rationality, rather than optimising a grouppayoff[153]. In this implementation, congregations are formed over successive rounds of a game andall members of a congregation are treated as a coalition to receive a payoff. In other implementationswhere congregations do not directly play a game, coalitions may be formed from congregation members.Congregations are self-selecting: if agents do not achieve any benefit, they may infer that a differentcongregation is more suited to them; an agent may increase its own utility but also that of the con-gregation it leaves by establishing that their respective goals or methods are incompatible. Clans are acomplementary concept to congregations, but have a notion of trust and require agents to be invited tojoin, rather than using self-selection[150].One property of the congregating process in [153] is the use of labelers, who assign identifying infor-mation to a locus (commmon feature) that connects congregators. (Potential) Congregators must sharea common semantic understanding of these labels. These labels could be information about function ormembership, and congregators rank these labels in order or preference. Congregators estimate the utilitythey might derive from membership of a congregation and then choose the locus that maximises thispayoff. Labels need not actually include any information about a congregation; congregators may learnwhich are more preferable through trial-and-error, rather than identifying common ground.The task-satisficing coalition formation method in [154] draws on concepts similar to congregations.However, in this case agents are not explicitly part of a congregation, but rather each agent maintains aninternal representation of neighbours as a group of those it believes are able to assist in a particular task.To solve a multi-agent problem, they choose an initial coalition based on a ranking of agent capabilities,past performance and knowledge of the environment. A negotiation phase selects willing agents fromthose identified as able. If the formation of this coalition is unsuccessful, it will attempt to form anothercoalition with lower-ranked agents. Whilst it is not guaranteed that a successful coalition will be formed,it is reasonable to start with a coalition of agents that have previously cooperated successfully. Theagents are also capable of learning satisficing negotiation strategies that allow fast, albeit non-optimal,cooperation by re-attempting successful proposals instead of trying to maximise payoff.\u2013 117 \u20135.1. Multi-Agent Systems5.1.8 The Cooperation ProcessWooldridge and Jennings[155] provide a simple definition of cooperation in a formalisation of CooperativeProblem Solving (CPS): \u201cCooperative problem solving (CPS) occurs when a group of logically decen-tralized agents choose to work together to achieve a common goal\u201d. The stages involved in this are asfollows:\u0088 Recognition: The CPS process begins when some agent recognises the potential forcooperative action; this recognition may come about because an agent has a goal that itis unable to achieve in isolation, or, more generally, because the agent prefers assistance.\u0088 Group formation: During this stage, the agent that recognised the potential for cooper-ative action in the previous stage solicits assistance. If this stage is successful, then itwill end with a group having a joint commitment to collective action.\u0088 Plan formation: During this stage, the agents attempt to negotiate a joint plan that theybelieve will achieve the desired goal.\u0088 Group action: During this stage, the newly agreed plan of joint action is executed by theagents, which maintain a close-knit relationship throughout; this relationship is definedby an agreed social convention, which every agent follows.Though game theory aspects are discussed in more depth later, it is useful define groups and resultsas follows1:Definition 1 Coalitional Game: The game is a pair, (N,V ) where\u0088 N is a finite set of agents\u0088 S is the members of a coalition, S \u2286 N\u0088 v : 2N 7\u2192 R is a payoff to each coalition S, also called the characteristic functionA key assumption of many analyses and strategies, particularly those identified in Section 5.1.9, isthat the payoff function is known in advance for agents to evaluate.Wooldridge and Jennings[155] point out a simplification in their formalisation of the recognition task,that an agent knows in advance the identity of the group it believes could cooperate to achieve a goal.However, this results in a statement of the (mental) conditions that allow for cooperation:1Other representations are available, such as weighted majority[156].\u2013 118 \u2013Chapter 5. Multi-Agent Systems for LVDN Control(PfC i \u03c6)def=(Goal i \u03c6) \u2227 \u2203g \u00b7 (Bel i(J-Can g \u03c6))\u2227\u00ac(Can i \u03c6 )\u2228(Bel i \u2200\u03b1\u00b7(Agt \u03b1 i) \u2227 (Achieves \u03b1 \u03c6)\u21d2 (Goal i (Doesn\u2019t \u03b1 )))That is to say, agent i has the Potential for Cooperation (PfC) to achieve goal \u03c6 iff:\u0088 it holds the goal \u03c6\u0088 there exists a group g, and i believes that g has the capability to achieve \u03c6\u0088 that i cannot achieve \u03c6, or, that it has a goal not to perform an action that would otherwise achieve\u03c6 (perhaps on grounds of cost, or other conflicting objective)Given that an agent has recognised that there is potential for some form of action a group may take,the actual method of putting together that group may vary considerably: the social, organisational oreconomic contexts the agents exist in have a considerable impact in the subsequent team formation task.The team formation or coalition formation step in cooperation described above is a large topic in itself.Section 5.1.7.2 describes coalitions and the formation problem, but there are other organisational struc-tures that can be used; in contrast to a coalition formed dynamically in response to a problem, alternativestructures are possible, and may differ in terms of approach, autonomy and persistence. Putting to-gether a group to solve a problem requires communication. Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents(FIPA) (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents) standardised the language FIPA Semantic Language(FIPA-SL)[157] and set of communicative acts[158], following the semantics of the Beliefs-Desires Inten-tions agent architecture[147]. FIPA-SL can be used for representing many types of information and isapplicable in many of the situations where communication is necessary, not just in establishing a groupof agents. Speech acts are the communication of information that are in themselves actions; conceptssuch as propose or agree are speech acts, and these can be both rational actions and message contentsto be exchanged. There is a need for interaction protocols to give meaning to these messages from thecontext of an exchange. FIPA has also determined the contract-net protocol[159] as a standardised pro-cess of interactions in task allocation with negotiation, but stops short of describing the process for groupformation; The formation problem is structure-dependent, but there are approaches to generalising theproblem[160] through cooperation protocols.Agents may be fully acquiescent to requests of others, acting in the best interests of the wider group.This is referred to as DPS, Cooperative Problem Solving (CPS), or Cooperative MAS[161]. In DPS, agentscooperate in order to increase the overall outcome of the system, and are not concerned with personal\u2013 119 \u20135.1. Multi-Agent Systemspayoffs. There is a considerable body of work on the topic of DPS, and Multi-Agent Cooperation andCollaboration has been a national conference theme since 1991 at the American Association for ArtificialIntelligence (AAAI). However, cooperation can still be achieved where agents are self-interested. AsShoham and Leyton-Brown point out, cooperation does not mean a loss of self-direction:It does not mean that... each agent is agreeable and will follow arbitrary instructions. Rather,it means that the basic modeling unit is the group rather than the individual agent.[162]A game-theoretic approach incorporating some payoff mechanism can produce a system-wide emergingresult. Whilst this may not be directed by a central decision, a well-designed mechanism may implicitly di-rect the system behaviour without sacrificing agent autonomy, providing a balance between self-interestedagents and a fully altruistic DPS implementation. In this context, we may design markets where agentsbid to supply or purchase a resource or service. We may describe the system in terms of payoff forthe result of certain interactions, and engineer these such that successful strategies will incorporate acooperative element.Where we have a superadditive environment, any addition of an agent to a coalition does no harm:Definition 2 Superadditive game: \u2200S, T \u2282 N , if S \u2229 T = \u2205, =\u21d2 v(S \u222a T ) \u2265 v(S) + v(T )However, it this is often not the case in real-world application. Communication and complexity bothincrease with the number of agents, creating a cost to add each new agent that may not be outweighedby the corresponding benefit. There may also be task interactions or conflicting goals specific to thedomain. For these or other reasons, the payoff function v(S) may be dependent upon the members ofthe coalition, rather than the action they may produce. The grand coalition is the coalition of all theagents in a finite set of players; in the case of a superadditive game, the grand coalition is an optimum,providing the maximum payoff in the game. However, non-superadditive environments do not guaranteethis optimum, and there must be a means to decide which agents should act together.Having identified potential for cooperation and formed some group of agents to work together, theagents must then actually perform the tasks required. In contrast to apparently coordinated but emergentbehaviour of autonomous actors, Levesque et al. argue that for joint action, agents acting togethermust have an awareness of the mental state of the other agents in the group[148]. This is a strongerrequirement than outlined above that agents know there is the possibility for cooperation[155]. Followingthis definition, they give an outline of the agent mental attitudes required to define joint action. A mutualbelief must be held about a proposition, allowing a mutual goal to be held. Building on \u201cIntention isChoice with Commitment\u201d[147], we can generalise to a group of agents with joint commitment to thegoal: they may have joint intention.\u2013 120 \u2013Chapter 5. Multi-Agent Systems for LVDN ControlDefinition 3 Joint intention is a joint commitment to perform an action while mutually believing through-out the action that the agents are doing it.Further, agents are required to inform the other participants of the joint goal if they come to believe ithas been achieved or is impossible. On the one hand, the requirement to inform the other agents upondiscovery of success or failure makes for a more strongly held attitude, but on the other it creates aproblem: attempts are not abandoned based on uncertainty about other agents, but on whether the taskis achievable. There should be a mechanism to identify when another agent has stopped participatingfor any reason (whether as a result of a defection in self-interest, or communication failure or otherwise).Agents are not committed to particular individual actions that may be irrelevant due to inaction on thepart of other agents. It leaves the actual execution of actions to later work. The overall joint problemmay be broken down into subtasks which may have a precedence order or require a specific agent toundertake, particularly in a society of heterogeneous agents. Some further coordination may be required;but the formulation above means that all of the agents remain mutually committed to the goal, evenwhere they are currently inactive and dependent upon some other event.5.1.8.1 RecognitionAn agent may identify a need for cooperation through analysis of its beliefs, desires and intentions(or corresponding rationalisation from any other cognitive model). This forms part of the means-endreasoning step in performing actions: it must establish that another agent may be capable of an actionthat would contribute to objective achievement[151]. This reasoning step is implementation-specific andhence beyond the scope of this document. However, the simple determination that cooperation is possibleis insufficient, and these agents must be identified.Communication may form a part of the recognition process. In the coordination approach presentedby Durfee and Montgomery, agents broadcast high-level information about their behaviour[163]. In thecoordination problem, agents may adjust their behaviour to resolve conflicts by exchanging informationabout their actvities arranged around 6 dimensions (who, what, when, where, how and why). Thisexchange can also facilitate recognition of potential positive interactions as an agent discovers alignmentsor opportunities in these behaviours. At a lower level of detail, intention transfer[164] is a recognitiontechnique that allows an agent to adopt another\u2019s commitment as its own when a group-level goal isidentified. A common theme to the agent discovery processes is information broadcast, such as in aCall for Proposals announcement[158], but there are techniques that do not require this communicationfunction.A representation of properties of other agents may permit reasoning to identify their ability to assist insome particular task. To use this approach, an agent must maintain a list of agents and their capabilities.Facilitation agents can be used to streamline the process of identifying collaborators. A \u201cyellow pages\u201d\u2013 121 \u20135.1. Multi-Agent Systemsagent maintains a list of agents and their capabilities. Agents register with this service when joining asociety; an agent may interrogate this list to find those with the capabilities relevant to a particular task,meaning relevant data is communicated when necessary, rather than broadcast in advance. The initialcoalition generation approach in [154] uses a learning technique to store previous successful interactionsto rank potential collaborators for a new task.Multiple agents may be in a position to collaborate, and possibly with different outcomes or payofffunctions. Decisions on how (or even if ) to optimise the system form a part of the group formation task,discussed in Section 5.1.8.2.5.1.8.2 Group FormationOnce a group of collaborators (with a relevant organisational structure) has been identified, a process isrequired to consolidate the group and commit them to solving the task.5.1.8.2.1 Group consolidationWhichever structure is used, the coordination approach should incorporate a dynamic element that allowsfor the maintenance and failure that is a feature of real-life systems[165]. As well as the formation teamfunction, failure tolerance and self-diagnosis should extend throughout the life of the collaboration effort.Ketcphel enumerates desired characteristics of a method to form coalitions[166]:\u0088 Stability: that agents will not defect to another coalition, usually by satisfying individual rationalityand maximising payoff.\u0088 Efficiency: The method should have low communication and computational cost.\u0088 Decentralisation: Agents should participate directly to increase resilience and scalability, and toreduce bottlenecks.\u0088 Symmetry: agents should have similar computational requirements. Addition of members shouldnot disrupt the system.Ketchpel\u2019s algorithm consists of an iterative process to join pairs of entities at a time. If we considera task that can only be solved by a coalition of many agents, it may not be individually rational for anagent to join a small unsuccessful coalition in the first iterations. This method may thus fail to produce auseful outcome where the domain does not satisfy the superadditivity assumption. However, the processof communication for partner identification, calculation of utility, negotiation and unification into a singlegroup still hold for other approaches to the group formation problem.Formation of a coalition is computationally complex. Enumerating the possible coalitions to find anoptimum solution is an NP-complete problem, increasing in difficulty with the size of an agent society.\u2013 122 \u2013Chapter 5. Multi-Agent Systems for LVDN ControlShehory and Kraus [161] present a method of solving a problem that accounts for task precedence andthe capabilities of heterogeneous agents, but acknowledge that scalability is an issue. Computing optimarequires full knowledge of tasks, agent capabilities and payoffs, which may not be feasible. However,communication requirements for negotiation and formation may also pose a problem. Sandholm andLesser describe how bounded rational agents can make a decision on coalition choice by trading offsolution quality for computational complexity[167]. Alternatively, past performance can be used to selectpreferred collaborators: in the iterative process in [154], an agent maintains a list of likely collaborators,proposes it, and if necessary tries again with those ranked lower. Directly solving a system optimum isnot always necessary; in a market approach, agents will join a coalition of service buyers and sellers wherea price is acceptable to them. Repeated interactions with agents joining, leaving or forming coalitionsshould cause payoffs to approach some equilibrium.5.1.8.2.2 Group agreementIn the DPS approach, the negotiation phase consists simply of asking an agent to cooperate followed byacceptance or rejection. However, where market or other considerations apply, there may be negotiationor bargaining. The game theory aspects of what offers are made, whether they will be accepted or evenadhered to will be discussed in Section 5.1.9.The calculation phase involves each agent determining the value of a coalition to itself; this will informoffers it makes or is willing to accept in the negotiation phase. An agent may demand a particular payoffto agree to participate. However, a well-defined payoff function is not always available, and differentagents may have different estimates of the value of the coalition. Ketchpel proposes that one agentis elected as the coalition manager through an auction, and takes on the risk. The manager pays itspartner a fixed amount, but receives any surplus or deficit of utility[168]. In common with the algorithmin [166], large coalitions are built up from smaller ones over an iterative process, and in each instancethe managerial relationship is maintained such that the non-managing agents always receive the agreedpayment.Bargaining consists of a cycle of offers, counteroffers and finally acceptance or termination when nomore offers are made. This might be at the point where an offer has been made, accepted and otherparties no longer try to disrupt that coalition[156]. The bargaining process is of more relevance whenforming coalitions competing to maximise payoff to members; however, it offers a mechanism to resolvethe case where two groups discover and attempt to solve the same task.5.1.8.3 DialogueBurmeister, Haddadi and Sundermeyer proposed a generic cooperation protocol[160], arguing that adialogue approach communicates more information through context than the act or contents of com-\u2013 123 \u20135.1.

The authors refer to dialogue types as cooperation patterns,such as contracting, bargaining or persuading, in contrast to the message types such as inform, accept orreject.FIPA Contract-Net[159] is a contracting pattern. It specifies how a task can be assigned to otheragents without the process of establishing the joint commitment described in Section 5.1.8. Larger tasksare decomposed into well-defined subtasks. A Call for Proposals (CfP) is issued, and other agents bidfor the opportunity to perform the task; the initiating agent then awards the tasks to the agents, anda contract is formed between those agents. Large tasks are thus formed of many two-party cooperativeefforts where one pays the other to execute the subtask, rather than a combined effort where all partiesare aware of a higher goal.Joint commitment requires establishing joint beliefs. The commitment step requires negotiation on thepart of the agents in order for them rationally to commit to action, whether to confirm agent acceptance anoffer of coalition or to propose a specific payoff distribution. This can create a need for an intermediate pre-commitment step[151]. After group selection, a negotiating position is proposed. Once this is accepted,the joint commitment is formed. At each step it is rational for an agent to communicate some informationabout its beliefs or bargaining position. At the point where negotiation concludes, the agent believesthat the other agent is either already committed, or will eventually become committed. These rationalcommunication steps form the negotiation protocol.5.1.8.4 Group Action5.1.8.4.1 Task allocationBefore task allocation is determined, the joint ability (J-Can) component of Potential for Cooperation maynot be satisfied. A task to achieve a goal can be decomposed into subtasks, and these tasks contracted-out to other agents. Design effort may be required in setting up a specific task decomposition andcommunication \u2014 an agent may not know what the subtasks are.5.1.9 Market Mechanisms in CooperationAgent interactions for cooperation can be a result of an effective market-driven environment. Agents aretypically modelled as rational economic actors, which allows the application of game theory to explain ordesign particular outcomes. However, there are factors regarding fairness and properties of the contextthat will determine just how applicable this model may be. This section introduces game theory aspectsof cooperation and discusses some of those issues.\u2013 124 \u2013Chapter 5. Multi-Agent Systems for LVDN Control5.1.9.1 Payoff DistributionIn terms of coalitional games,\u201cThe central question in coalitional game theory is the division of the payoff to the grandcoalition among the agents[162]\u201d.If we consider division of the value v(S) of a coalition as a necessary function to facilitate collaboration,there is a requirement for some payment mechanism.Definition 4 Transferrable Utility Assumption: The payoff to a coalition may be freely divided anddistributed to its members.Utility has no fixed scale or unit, but money has a convenient linear value which can be used to assessan actor\u2019s utility. Payoff can usually be represented by money. However, payoff is not always indivisible.In money transactions, this might only be an issue with, for example, a distributed system where smallcomputing tasks are outsourced to other agents at a cost of fractions of a penny. Payoff is more difficultto transfer in non-money transactions where a good is only available in whole units, or only the firstinstance has value. In a electric network, a payoff could be permits for a number of wind turbines tosupply power; however, a coalition owning a virtual wind farm cannot allocate fractions of permits to itsparticipants, and there is no point in allocating two permits to a single turbine.Inter-agent transfers of utility are called sidepayments. This mechanism causes Definition 4 to hold.These payments may be made in advance of a coalition forming: agent A pays agent B to form a coalitionS1{A,B} rather than B\u2019s preference S2{B,C}. This secures a higher payoff for A by compensating theloss of utility to B. The end result is indistinguishable from an alternative distribution of the payoff v(S1)between A and B. The inverse of Definition 4 is nontransferable utility, where v(S) is a pre-defined vectorcontaining payoffs to individual agents.With transferrable utility or individual payoffs, the grand coalition may not always be formed; agentsmay prefer to form other coalitions that maximise personal payoffs. Consider (N, v) with two successfulcoalitions: S1 = {A,B,C,D} and S2 = {A,E}. If v is split equally between coalition members, thereis an incentive for agents {A,E} to form S2. In this coalitional game, the task has still been performedand the payoff achieved, but the payoff only benefits two agents in N . Given that v is dependent uponS, this may also be at the cost of lower group utility. Whether this is fair in a given agent society isproblematic as there are many ways of defining fairness. A Pareto optimal coalition is found if there isnot an alternative in which all the agents may achieve a better (or at least equal) payoff. Whilst a groupmay achieve a higher overall payoff, it is necessarily at the expense of one of its members.Definition 5 Core: the set of Pareto optimal coalitions.\u2013 125 \u20135.1. Multi-Agent SystemsThe core satisfies group, coalitional and individual rationality. However, the core may be empty whereno set of coalitions satisfies all three. Coreless games require a mechanism to resolve these conflicts, toavoid a repeating cycle of proposal, counterproposal and defection[156].5.1.10 DecentralisationThe idea of Intention Transfer was developed as a novel method to facilitate agent participation in eventresolution[164]. With Intention Transfer, an agent announces its intentions to an agent society, andothers may \u201copt-in\u201d to perform non-explicit joint action outside of existing conventions for cooperativeproblem solving. This permits agents operating with incomplete information to assist others where it isappropriate, and also to plan accordingly.5.1.10.1 Model of Agent ExistenceIn the Cohen and Levesque possible-worlds model described in Section 5.1.5, an agent may access (that is,inhabit) a world consistent with its beliefs about that next world (through operator B). Further, Cohenand Levesque introduce the operator G : a world may access through G all worlds in which the statement\u03c6 is true. This G is referred to as a \u201cgoal\u201d. An achievement goal may be represented as choosing aworld in which \u03c6 is possible, but currently false; this conveniently drops the goal once \u03c6 becomes true.Sadek prefers choice (operator C, being distinct from an achievement goal), where an agent chooses thenext world in line with its desires[169]. An agent may only choose C (or G) that are compatible with B ;if, in the next world, the agent believes \u03c6, it may not simultaneously choose a world in which\u00ac \u03c6 is true.This realism constraint is defined as C \u2286 B. The violation of this definition of the realism constraint ispossible, although normally irrational (e.g. \u201cChoose a world in which \u03c6 is true but you believe it not tobe\u201d). The constraint is better represented as C(i,\u03c6)\u21d2 \u00ac B(i,\u00ac \u03c6). A combination of realism-constrainedchoices and beliefs prevents an agent from choices which are impossible through reducing the set ofworlds to those which are compatible. At the next point in time, the agent will inhabit some world inthe compatible subset made from a combination of realistic choices (constrained by beliefs); free choices,where an agent selects a preference for some property it has no current knowledge of; and open choicesfrom its indifference to any other properties. Practically, however, the idea of world choice is ratherintangible in its application to real software agents; FIPA refers to C, a desire [158], and does not includeit in its operators of B, I, and the persistent goal PG as choice without an attached commitment or plan.5.1.10.2 IntentionGoals and choices do not convey any necessity or compulsion on the part of the agent to act to attemptto bring about a transition to the desired world. In order to solve this problem, Intention I is definedin \u201cIntention is Choice with Commitment\u201d[147] as the combination of C operator and a persistentcompulsion to act towards achieving a goal. Without this made explicit, an agent may never actually\u2013 126 \u2013Chapter 5. Multi-Agent Systems for LVDN Controltake steps towards fulfilling a goal, or may abandon its attempts too soon. The agent only drops anintention once it believes it is unfeasible to achieve or the new target state has been brought about. Insoftware implementation under the BDI model described above, an active intention will result in routinesbeing selected from a library of available plans and executed until the agent believes the task is finished,irrelevant or is unfeasible. Cohen & Levesque[147] illustrate two kinds of intention: INTEND1, whichconcerns actions (e.g. \u201cintend to switch on a load\u201d), and INTEND2, which concerns a state of the world(e.g. \u201cintend to take action so that it is true that the load has been switched on\u201d). An agent may haveexecuted all applicable plans to try to achieve the result of its intention; however, this may have beeninsufficient. It may then be rational for an agent to abandon its intention, reasoning that because it hasno more plans to achieve a still-unrealised final state, its intention is unfeasible. It may then reassumeit as a Persistent Goal. In this implementation, however, the agent retains the intention. For simplicity,it is assumed (although not stated explicitly) that an agent\u2019s goals are achievable. It could be arguedthat responding to requests and informing others of its intention is a plan for its achievement, althoughit may no longer be directly responsible for its effectuation.This is not a problem, however: Cohen and Levesque\u2019s INTEND2 permits an intention to be heldeven alongside the belief that another agent might achieve the same end. Whilst not implemented here,Intention Transfer does not preclude the possibility of an agent dropping its intention once another hasadopted it if it has a belief that another agent will achieve the same result.The two forms of intention share a similar representation: INTEND1 is of the form(I Agent (done VUp))where I is the intention operator, Agent is the agent that has committed to some action, and VUp is thegeneric action of directly raising the voltage. The expression(done VUp)is the statement that action VUp has been performed.INTEND2 can be illustrated with the voltage comparison proposition voltageabovelowerbound :(I Agent (B Agent voltageabovelowerbound))which means that the agent commits to action such that it should eventually come to believe that theproposition is true, where B is the belief operator.\u2013 127 \u20135.1. Multi-Agent Systems5.1.10.3 Intention TransferThe application of a common goal and its representation in an agent-based system is problematic inconventional power systems hierarchies with direct instructions or requests. An agent may be willingto cooperate, but be unable to do so due to some operational constraint. Or, it may cooperate, butknow that doing so is to the detriment of the requesting agent. This can be a particular issue whereagents only perceive their immediate environment, but can form beliefs about the rest of the worldthrough communication. Other factors, such as negotiation to cooperate (perhaps using market factors)and settlement on a common plan [149] may be redundant or irrelevant. A social agent may wish tocommunicate its intentions to other agents in the system. With Intention Transfer, an agent announcesits intentions to an agent society, and others may \u201copt-in\u201d to this intention to perform non-explicit jointaction outside of the conventions for cooperative problem solving. This permits agents operating withincomplete information to assist others where it is appropriate, and also to plan accordingly. To illustratethis, voltage drop is considered as one of the control system goals. The opt-in basis without a negotiationor acknowledgement of commitment means there is no compulsion on the part of the receiving agent toadopt an intention. However, if an agent\u2019s logic dictates that it is willing and able to assist, the agentreceiving such an intention may then adopt it as(I Agent (B RemoteAgent voltageabovelowerbound))which would be held until informed of success; thus, the intention has been transferred.INTEND2 is used for this application as a scalable and future-proof way to describe a property to bechanged. Agents with plans with the rational effect of achieving (or working towards) the same desiredworld state (rather than a commonly-named similar action) would be able to participate, even as newdevice types are added to the electrical network.There are key distinctions from an agent performing a direct REQUEST for assistance (such as in[113]): Firstly, the initiating agent is not required to specify which agent it wishes to perform someaction. Secondly, a receiving agent may conclude that others may be better situated to assist, based onknowledge unavailable to the initiating agent. Alternatively, an intention may be adopted as a persistentbut non-planned goal that may become available in the future, rather than flatly refusing cooperation.A more general communication of agent intention can be useful; other agents can reason about theintentions of others to determine their own actions, particularly in regard to forward planning. However,this specifically examines Intention Transfer as an approach for decentralised system control where agentsopt-in to achieve a common goal.With a method for opting-in to action described, one further challenge is to decide which of the will-\u2013 128 \u2013Chapter 5. Multi-Agent Systems for LVDN Controling agents should assist. Mechanisms for doing so include multi-agent system negotiation, elections orauctions, centralised allocation, technical assessment or random chance. Without some form of interven-tion here, an entire agent society might attempt to switch simultaneously to solve a short-term minorproblem at a single node, with potentially serious adverse consequences. In a real system this would bean unreasonable response, so there must be limitations on the extent of action.5.1.10.4 Applying Intention TransferThe application of this novel approach requires a multi-agent test platform, and adaptation to the powersystem domain. It must also address the redundant-action issue outlined above. In this implementation,an agent calculates a short delay before acting, based on a function of the difference between its ownvoltage and that of an agent announcing a problem. As previously noted in Chapter 4, in more complexsystems voltage may not necessarily indicate network location - however, this added an important plug-and-play facet to agents: without any configuration or prior knowlege, the closer it is to a problem, themore effective it is likely to be in its assistance.With this modification, this multi-agent systems algorithm can be tested on the power systems voltagecontrol case used for illustration above. The next section describes novel testbed systems that weredeveloped to combine power systems with a multi-agent platform; finally, results for trial of IntentionTransfer in power system control are presented in Section 5.3.3.5.2 Test Systems5.2.1 OverviewThis section documents the design and creation of three novel test systems that integrate power systemsand multi-agent systems for control system trials.Initial testing and development used a single PC to develop a MAS with basic communicating agentswithout any sophisticated underlying electrical model. It was apparent early on that this single computerwas insufficiently powerful for the task of emulating the behaviour of embedded controllers continuouslymonitoring network conditions for more than a few agent instances. In addition, development toward amodelling approach incorporating real-time simulation, multiple physical nodes and hardware-in-the-loopwas intended to create a realistic testing environment.The three systems that were developed were a) a proof-of-concept MAS/distribution network simu-lation system; b) a cluster supercomputer implementation; and c) a unique electrical network/hardware-in-the-loop/software platform. The multi-agent system approach remained common across the threesystems, and is presented here first.\u2013 129 \u20135.2. Test Systems5.2.2 Common Multi-Agent System5.2.2.1 Overall PlatformThe common platform comprises the non-hardware elements of the environment in which the softwareagents exist. This includes the choice of messaging system and network protocols, inter-agent languageand ontology, and societal structure.Agents can be implemented in a number of ways to operate successfully within this environment; how-ever, other common choices were made in their development: the control agents (and facilitation agentsin 5.2.3) were developed using the same programming language and with the same agent developmenttool. These agents were also developed with a common approach to the internal logic systems - the BDIagent cognitive architecture.5.2.2.2 Agent Cognitive ArchitectureCognitive architecture \u2014 whether BDI, CLARION, DUAL or any other \u2014 is an implementation choice.Agents are unaware of the internal structure of others; division of an agent into subsystems serves tosimplify the construction of an agent to the programmer. For reasons of familiarity, the basic Belief-Desire-Intention model is used.This BDI model is often implemented in slightly different ways. One approach is to use layers ofmanagement, coordination and execution, where overall goals are selected, a general approach taken, andthen plans within that general approach reasoned upon and chosen based on their perceived feasibility.Another is to use an interpreter which provides the facility for reasoning through its connection with theagent\u2019s belief base, as PRS [170] does. A developer can choose any architecture or psychological model:the existence of rigid rulesets to determine agent actions, or highly specific applications, or a need forflexibility of response may inform this choice. After implementation, an agent functions as a \u201cblack box\u201dto all others on the system.BDI has been implemented in several frameworks which have been designed from different standpointsto facilitate agent development, building on theory of knowledge representation and cognitive models.[171] presents an introduction to several of these frameworks, in which their respective developers outlinetheir approach and rationale.Several toolkits are available for implementing the BDI cognitive architecture, of which several are ex-amined in [171]. JASON uses a language called AgentSpeak(L), which is specifically designed as to incor-porate representation of BDI attributes, inter-agent communication and internal reasoning mechanisms.JACK uses BDI representation internally for high-level beliefs, plans and intentions, but emphasisesflexibility in communication, platform and programming language support as vital in the multi-agentapproach. The JADE framework (discussed in Section 5.2.2.7) does not implement BDI directly, but\u2013 130 \u2013Chapter 5. Multi-Agent Systems for LVDN Controlrather provides a scheduler that allows a developer to implement goal, intention and plan managementthrough addition and removal of behaviours, whilst providing tools to facilitate compliance with FIPAstandards. Use of existing frameworks is useful to save development time and facilitate interoperability.5.2.2.3 Agent SocietyThe discussion in the sections above indicates that holarchy is an appropriate societal structure for alocalised control goal; however, in this implementation the opt-in cooperation needs even less hierarchyand is akin to a congregation.5.2.2.4 Multi-Agent System Standards5.2.2.4.1 InteroperabilityFoundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA) was set up in 1996 with the intention of forming stan-dards to facilitate interoperation between agents and multi-agent systems. Their standards define FIPAAgent Communication Language (FIPA-ACL), sequences of communication for particular interactiontypes, and content languages for representing and communicating knowledge within those messages andinteractions. This includes FIPA Semantic Language (FIPA-SL).5.2.2.4.2 CommunicationThe Communicative Act Library Specification [158] formalises FIPA-compliant discourse types, e.g. IN-FORM, REQUEST, PROPOSE, AGREE ; it also describes the basis for representing information inmessage structure through FIPA-ACL and in content through FIPA-SL. The specification of FIPA-SL[157] implements the first-order modal logic used in this chapter. The state of agents and various prop-erties of the world can be queried and exchanged by combining these two standards.Transport EncodingMessage EncodingMessage ProtocolContent LanguageOntologyFigure 5.2: Information encoding structureFigure 5.2 shows layers of information encoding for agent data exchange. The encoding of informationis independent of the structures (or ontology) used to describe the domain.\u2013 131 \u20135.2. Test SystemsThe use of XML-based encoding of data for communication was explored as an alternative to thestandard String encoding used in FIPA-SL, but the latter had a smaller packet size and some parsingfunctions already available through the Java Agent DEvelopment framework (JADE) platform.5.2.2.5 Language and LogicFIPA-SL is based from work built on by Cohen and Levesque[147] for the basic agent BDI structure, whichused a \u201cpossible-worlds\u201d basis and a first-order modal language (later, the meaning of agent intention,a mental attitude of an agent that may be communicated, was revised and clarified in [169]). FIPA-SL allows for communication of descriptions of agent beliefs, desires and intentions, as well as logicalpropositions about these. Definitions in the ontology are terms that can be included in dialogue; thesecomplex messages allow agents to rationalise about the mental attitude of other agents, as well as thephysical reality of qualitative or quantitative data.5.2.2.6 OntologyOntology is a study of being : specifically, description of concepts and relationships between them. Anontology is used in this context to refer to a specification of descriptions within a domain. A common setof data structures in the form of an ontology is used to allow all agents on the network to communicateusing a shared language. An ontology can be used to create a subsumption and composition (is-a andhas-a) directed acyclic graph linking all the components and information relevant to concepts within thedomain. The relationships can be used to allow an agent to perform reasoning about properties of theworld.An ontology describes how a concept is represented as combinations of basic data types (such asstring and integer) and other concepts. These can be instantiated with data from the physical worldto represent reality. Consequently, terms in the defined ontology can be inserted into agent discourse inorder to allow reasoning and discussion of real entities, concepts and properties.Ontology, as description of being, is inherently domain-specific. There are some relevant standardsfor describing items within electrical distribution networks, such as the data models within IEC 61850for Electrical Substation Automation design. However, these do not cleanly map onto all of the relevantentities and concepts. The ontology developed by Trichakis[1] goes some way to describing the problemdomain. However, the approach relied on a centralised approach with known network locations, whichintroduces configuration and maintenance barriers to using agents as an expedient to a plug-and-playsystem. Other design decisions, such as the use of \u201ccustomerVoltage\u201d, make little sense when consideringflexibility \u2014 such as monitoring voltage at DNO assets, e.g. transformers. There is a need to communicatedata that is not easily represented in this system.Building on the basic ideas, however, a relevant ontology was developed, using the Prote\u00b4ge\u00b4 ontology\u2013 132 \u2013Chapter 5. Multi-Agent Systems for LVDN Controldevelopment tool[172]. The ontology defines actions, predicates and concepts specific to the SSEZ domain:concepts, such as \u2018generator\u2019 or \u2018load\u2019 can have fixed attributes (e.g. \u2018rating\u2019 or \u2018state\u2019). Predicates allowcomparison of concepts and the perceived world (e.g. \u2018generator voltagelevel 1.02pu\u2019). In addition toelectrical network components, concepts of geography (such as GPS coordinates) were included. Theontology shared by all the agents on a system is a common structure of items that could be representedin several ways internally; this ontology is then used as the dictionary that forms inter-agent discoursein FIPA-SL.5.2.2.7 Development PlatformJava Agent DEvelopment framework (JADE)[173] is a set of widely-used open-source Java librarieswhich contain tools to assist implementation of a multi-agent system; it provides a FIPA-compliant agentplatform, with an Agent Management System (AMS) responsible for agent addressing, and a DirectoryFacilitator (DF) which contains a register of services offered by each agent [171]. It is hardware- andnetwork-independent, and inter-agent messaging is handled transparently to the developer at a highlevel regardless of host platform or network medium. It has a low memory footprint (100kB) for usein embedded systems. A skeleton JADE agent has a task scheduler and the ability to register with theagent platform and perform messaging. Custom Java functions which extend a \u201cbehaviour\u201d can then beadded to and removed from the scheduler to achieve agent functionality. JADE is widely used in severalindustries, and has been proposed and adopted in power systems control applications (e.g. [125], [174]).As well as the advantages outlined above, it has an active developer community, acceptance in existingproduction and mission-critical applications (particularly in telephony), and provides a well-documentedfault-tolerant platform.An add-on to JADE was developed in 2005 which adds an interpretive engine using FIPA-SL in orderto provide functionality shown in Figure 5.2.2.7. The central interpretive engine more closely followsthe theoretical model in [175]. The add-on ceased to be maintained by its developers toward the end of2009, and was an incomplete implementation. However, this software provided useful insight into agentstructures, and the message parsing functions of this add-on were integrated and adapted to facilitatethe use of FIPA-SL in this application.5.2.2.8 Control AgentsBased on the common platform building blocks described in Sections 5.2.2.2 - 5.2.2.7, two novel and similarcontrol agents were written: one for controllable loads (Load Agent (LA)), and one for microgenerators(Generator Agent (GA)).They were programmed in Java as a result of the decision to use the JADE platform.Following the choice of a BDI cognitive architecture, agent functionality was broken down into libraries\u2013 133 \u20135.2. Test SystemsInterpreterIncomingMessageOutgoing MessageMessageor ActionSemantic AgentPlansGoal Management LayerInterpretationPrinciplesGoalsBeliefsFigure 5.3: Semantic-enabled BDI architectureAn interpretive layer is used to rationalise about each of the components of a semantic agent; thediagram shows the connections between layers and libraries linked to an interpreting engine.of goals, intentions and plans. Figure 5.4 shows the basic agent structure used, in common with the theoryoutlined above; Figure 5.5 shows the specific planning, deliberative and acting functions for a Load Agentseparated into different layers, and the links between each.The JADE platform contains a scheduler that executes code related to Behaviour objects in turnfrom a list. The first objects added to the scheduler are a goal management object and an object tomaintain the agent\u2019s senses \u2014 the former tests achievability, priority and relevance of goals and can addand remove them accordingly; the latter updates the agent\u2019s perceptions of its environment.Functions may be added to and removed from the scheduler by behaviours in the layer above as wellas resulting from their natural completion. The bidirectional arrows highlight the communication ofinformation about function success, feasibility and current state to an adjacent layer.When action needs to be taken in order to achieve a goal, an appropriate intention is selected fromthe Intention library and added to the Scheduler\u2019s list.The Intention objects are added to commit the agent to action; this include strategies for plan selection.Whilst the goals and intentions are widely applicable, the plans may be hardware-specific.

Test Systemslow-level implementation is discussed in Section 5.2.5.2.Without a specific interpreter provided by the platform, the behaviour objects were written to func-tions to allow them to be evaluated in some respects such as if they are achievable, or if they conflict withothers. For example, Goal objects consist of a function to evaluate the possibility of their achievement,since a rational agent must drop unachievable goals. With Plan objects, for example, the switchLoadOffplan cannot be executed if the load is already switched off; its isRunnable() function may be tested inorder for an Intention object to evaluate its suitability in a given case.When a contingency occurs, the agent uses the JADE middleware to encode and broadcast the inten-tion to all the other agents on the system using the Agent Communication Language (ACL) INFORMperformative. An extra step is included in the software implementation: an agent is responsible for en-suring the accuracy of its internal belief base, so a message (QUERY-IF) is sent to the originating agentto request confirmation that the intention is still held before the receiving agent acts to assist.The format and basic functions of the LA and GA are similar, although the agent internal logic wasadjusted to give behaviour relevant to the controllled equipment during a voltage contingency. The agentswere given a simple schedule for demand or generation, which could either be high- or low-priority. Theseschedules were intended to illustrate demand and production in a repeatable way and to allow for forcingof contingencies, rather than using load profiles or probabilistic models.5.2.3 Proof-of-Concept System5.2.3.1 Introduction5.2.3.2 HardwareThe software was adapted to run on multiple computers, providing indication of system performancewhen tested with a real communications medium.This multi-node test system comprised a network of 15 PCs, shown in Figure 5.6. They ranged inspecification and connection, from a 32-bit Intel 2GHz processor with IEEE 802.11g WiFi connectionat 24Mbps, up to a dual-core 64-bit 2.4GHz AMD Opteron; Each of the control nodes were connectedwith IEEE 802.3ab gigabit ethernet; the main platform node was connected to this router via Wireless(802.11g at 54Mb/s).The Simulation Agent (described in Section 5.2.3.4) and Agent Management System were hosted onthe node connected by wireless network. The remaining 14 nodes each hosted a Load Agent and were onthe wired portion of the network.5.2.3.3 Electrical NetworkThe electrical network, based on the UK Generic Network discussed in Chapter 3, was modelled in IPSA.A python script was devised to iterate across the feasible combinations of equipment states to generate\u2013 136 \u2013Chapter 5. Multi-Agent Systems for LVDN Control802.11g WirelessOperatingPointsDatabaseAgent PC hostsEthernet SwitchUniversity NetworkAgentPlatformhostFigure 5.6: Multi-node networked PC testbedan exhaustive set of static network operating points and corresponding equipment voltages. These datawere put into a database. The voltage-monitoring components of the Load Agents were provided withmeasurements from this database.5.2.3.4 SoftwareThe Simulation Agent hosted the operating points database and supplied the Load Agents with a voltagelevel via the standard JADE messaging subsystem, rather than a real AC waveform to be read by aphysical voltmeter.5.2.4 High-Performance Cluster5.2.4.1 IntroductionIn the proof-of-concept system, only 14 load agents could be operated due to memory constraints. Theagents were ported to a computer cluster with many identical nodes. This proved more flexible for testingand initialising agents through the use of scripting files, and expanded the simulation beyond 14 nodes.This system is described in this section.5.2.4.2 HardwareDurham University High Performance Computing Service has a supercomputer known as the HamiltonCluster, which consists of many networked multi-core Intel Xeon E5520 2.26 GHz processors that canrun programs in parallel within a common environment. In this case, each agent (including the SA) wasassigned to an individual core by the Cluster\u2019s scheduling engine. When the cluster was commissioned,up to 1800 cores could be made available, and this has subsequently been expanded to 1950+ cores.Supercomputer time on this scale was not available for this project, but in principle could allow simulations\u2013 137 \u20135.2. Test Systemsthat could cover several low-voltage feeders simultaneously.5.2.4.3 Electrical NetworkThe operating points database was re-generated to include distributed generation. 14 load agents and 6generator agents (i.e. a total of 20) agents were trialled, using the same IPSA+ model.In practice, the operating points database used an inefficient data structure; when combined with4GB RAM available per core, this limited the size of tests size to fewer than 30 agents. However, thiswas considered sufficient to examine the underlying principles on the understanding that a fast and leandatabase system could be applied in future to allow for testing at scale.5.2.4.4 Software5.2.4.4.1 Control agentsThe agent structure remained substantially similar to those in the proof-of-concept system; the generatorand load agents were similar except that a generator should not disconnect in an undervoltage case.5.2.4.4.2 Startup toolsTo execute agents across multiple processors, a wrapper was written in C using MPI2 to request andaccess a number of cores, and then to start a relevant agent on each available processor.5.2.5 Real-time Hardware-in-Loop Platform5.2.5.1 IntroductionFigure 5.7 shows the overall system outline, which includes the RSCAD model and Real-Time Digi-tal Simulator (RTDS); the Beagleboard target platform and associated Input/Output (I/O) hardware;network router; and agent platform host/Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server.5.2.5.2 Hardware5.2.5.2.1 Embedded Controllers - OverviewA range of embedded controller target hardware was considered. In order for the test facility to beboth flexible and relevant, a widely available general-purpose single-board computer was chosen with theidea that off-the-shelf components could be integrated and tested, reducing costs of development andlarge-scale deployment.Figure 5.8 shows the arrangement of the embedded controller hardware. Each controller was connectedto the network switch (bottom right). Attached to each controller is a daughterboard (not pictured) withan onboard Analogue-to-Digital Converter (ADC) which provides access to the RTDS voltage signals.2Message Passing Interface, a multi-purpose tool for communication, and synchronising and scheduling parallel code oncluster computers\u2013 138 \u2013Chapter 5.

The Beagleboard uses a 1GHz ARM Cortex-8 processor,with 512MB RAM. The board also hosts USB and ethernet adapters. An array of 20 beagleboards weremounted to a frame with associated network cabling and power supply.At the time of purchase, the Beagleboard-xM cost approximately \u00a3100. However, there has sincebeen considerable expansion in the single-board computer market \u2014 the Beagleboard Black (an updatedmodel) is now available for \u00a344; the Raspberry Pi 2 is now available (albeit with a 0.9GHz processor)for \u00a326 in single units. Whilst the use of general-purpose computing was previously perceived as tooexpensive for this application, the move to such low-cost hardware makes a future of ubiquitous location-aware controllers a realistic possibility.5.2.5.2.3 GPS receiverThe system used a GlobalSat BU-353 USB GPS recievers.\u2013 139 \u20135.2. Test SystemsFigure 5.8: Multi-Agent Hardware-In-Loop Test Platform - Controller arrayThe array of 20 beagleboard controllers were mounted to a frame. Also shown: network switch, test riginterface box featuring voltage conversion/transistor array for RTDS input.5.2.5.2.4 Signals I/O hardwareThe General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) channels used for control signals from the beagleboard tothe RTDS required more current than could be supplied, so were passed through a transistor array.The Beagleboard\u2019s onboard ADC proved to be highly nonlinear and not stable over time and thusunsuitable for this application. An external 14-bit ADC was used: the AD7899, by Analog Devices,was selected. The ADC has an accuracy of \u00b12 Least Significant Bits (LSBs), and the maximum sample\u2013 140 \u2013Chapter 5.

A pair of ADG3300 (with a maximumdata rate of 50Mbps, well in excess of the 400kHz sample rate) were used to convert voltage levels fromthe ADC outputs to the beagleboard inputs. A daughterboard was designed and fabricated to interfacethe ADC with the beagleboard, shown in Figure 5.9.Whilst the data collection in Section 4.3.5 used an off-the-shelf plug-in transformer, for the purposeof laboratory testing a break-out box was constructed to allow the system to be plugged into a domesticmains socket or to the RTDS without the need recalibration, using a voltage transducer with a range of-10V to +10V to represent a real deflection of -500V to +500V. The output range of the RTDS was setto be the same, meaning the controller hardware could be connected to either domestic sockets or to theRTDS hardware. The break-out box is shown in Figure 5.10.\u2013 141 \u20135.2. Test SystemsFigure 5.10: 240V Voltage transducerThe break-out box for measuring voltage. The domestic 3-pin plug and sockets are either side of theenclosure, with voltage and current signal outputs for direct measurement at the controllers. The LV25-Pvoltage transducer is shown as the middle component of the top row, which is accurate to within 1% andlinear to within 0.2%.5.2.5.2.5 Agent platform and routerThe JADE agent platform was hosted on a laptop computer. A Hewlett Packard 2524 network switchprovided IEEE 802.3u 100Mb/s ethernet between each of the embedded controllers and the agent plat-form.5.2.5.2.6 RTDSThe RTDS is a dedicated electrical network simlulator manufactured by RTDS Technologies. It uses1.7GHz Freescale MC7448 RISC processors, which have a dedicated vector execution unit making themhighly suitable for solving electrical networks using the method described in [135]. The Real-TimeOperating System (OS) manages the execution, which allows for a guaranteed 50\u00b5S timestep. Thiscorresponds to a system simulated to a 20kHz precision.5.2.5.3 Electrical NetworkAn RSCAD model, described in Chapter 3, is compiled into matrices and code to be executed by theRTDS.\u2013 142 \u2013Chapter 5. Multi-Agent Systems for LVDN Control5.2.5.4 Software5.2.5.4.1 DHCP server, agent platform and locationThe JADE agent platform was hosted on a computer connected to the router. This computer alsohosted a DHCP server to allocate network addresses to the controller. By communicating with thismachine, control agents could register with the DHCP server, join the agent platform and register theirGPS coordinates; this allowed them to search for their nearest neighbours by geographical distance. Afacilitator agent was written to provide this functionality.5.2.5.4.2 Embedded controller platformLinux was used as the OS for the beagleboards. A 2.6-family kernel was customised and compiled, andthe remaining system based off the A\u02dangstro\u00a8m distribution3 to allow a flexible platform for a wide rangeof software and hardware compatibility. Software written for the target could be easily ported to otherhardware.5.2.5.4.3 GPSThe gpsd daemon4 and gps4java5 were used to translate from the GPS hardware output to a format theagents could read.5.2.5.4.4 ADC systemA driver was written in C++ for the Linux platform to allow the agent to interface with the ADC.The driver activates a clock on the beagleboard, and routes the signal to the begin-conversion pin onthe ADC. An interrupt-driven routine copies the conversion result to a buffer in beagleboard memory,guaranteeing the required sample rate. Because the beagleboard processor executes the steps to copythe conversion result into memory, the sample rate was set to 5kHz as a compromise between agent codetime and sampling system time. The buffer could then be accessed through the driver.Two versions were implemented: one to allow the instantaneous voltage to measured, and the otherto return a buffer for RMS voltage calculation. The former was used to generate short-time datasets tocompute frequency components via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and cross-correlation in section 4.3.3,and then the latter for logging measurements for longer durations more akin to a high-resolution smartmeter for 4.3.4.3http://www.angstrom-distribution.org4http://www.catb.org/gpsd5http://taimos.github.io/GPSd4Java\u2013 143 \u20135.3. Results5.3 Results5.3.1 IntroductionThe three novel multi-agent test systems were each created for a specific purpose: firstly, a proof-of-concept system using multiple desktop PC nodes; secondly, a supercomputer system with a large numberof processor cores; and thirdly, a novel test rig comprising networked embedded controller target boardsand electrical network simulation hardware.The proof-of-concept system was used to trial a multi-agent control system that used a simple con-gregation of load controller agents and Intention Transfer to solve an undervoltage problem.The cluster computer was used for a facility to scale up to test more agents. It was trialled with acombination of load and generator controllers to solve an undervoltage problem.The real-time, hardware-in-loop test rig was designed to use the novel location derivation and multi-agent techniques in voltage control, implemented on physical embedded controllers on a real-time simu-lated arbitrary dynamic electrical distribution system.All three of these test systems used the same multi-agent framework, JADE, as described in Section5.2.2.7.5.3.2 JADE FrameworkThe JADE-provided Agent Management System was run in fault-tolerant mode: in the event that themain instance of the agent platform stopped responding (whether through software fault or networkoutage), one of several redundant platform instances took over. JADE has a facility to provide thisfault-tolerance through the use of federated, communicating facilitator nodes. In this way, the platformitself forms a distributed system, since these nodes could be hosted in multiple locations by severalpairties. The platform did not fail in any of the testing for the duration of the project. As in [1], astraightforward N-1 test of resilience was performed: the system demonstrated successful recovery whenone of the management system nodes was deliberately terminated.5.3.3 Intention Transfer5.3.3.1 Test outlineInitial testing was performed using the proof-of-concept system to demonstrate Intention Transfer witha voltage drop problem[164].In line with the technical challenges of integrating DER outlined in Section 2.2.1, control agents weredeveloped to tackle deviations from voltage limits, caused by too much consumption (undervoltage) ortoo much generation (overvoltage), with limits set by the UK regulations of acceptable fluctuation from\u2013 144 \u2013Chapter 5. Multi-Agent Systems for LVDN Controlnominal voltage. In the UK, voltage must not drop by more than 6% or rise by more than 10% of thenominal supply voltage[39].Control agents were developed for a multi-agent system that used a simple congregation. These wereimplemented on the proof-of-concept test system.5.3.3.2 Future Smart Grid ScenarioWhilst there is currently no relevant regulatory regime to enable household-scale DSM across the UKcontext, it is assumed that in a future smart grid there is a willingness on the part of householdersto allow some flexibility in their energy consumption, provided there are appropriate control tools. Asoutlined in Section 2.4, a future scenario of a particpatory, collaborative smart grid is used, such that theagents do not require direct market mechanisms to act. Load, storage and generation can all be resourcesin this future, so load and control agents were programmed as flexible entities with an interest in theirsurrounding network.This hypothetical future creates an application a of location-aware agent-based control system wherea key goal is voltage support. Other work considers regulations and acceptability of control decisionsto various stakeholders in LVDNs, so for the case of developing location in control, the DSM schemesapplied were kept simple.5.3.3.3 Control AgentsInitial testing used load agents with a basic functionality described in Section 5.2.2.8. The DSM schemefor consumer use did not implement a real-world consumer load profile, but rather the agents were givena simple schedule for demand or generation, which could either be high- or low-priority. These scheduleswere intended to illustrate demand and production in a repeatable way and to allow for forcing ofcontingencies, rather than using load profiles or probabilistic models. For proof-of-concept functionality,only the load agents were used in testing the undervoltage case. The control agents used absolute voltagemagnitudes to determine their action priority.The simulation was run for a set of use conditions which would ordinarily result in a combination of1\u20134 agents experiencing voltage excursions, occurring sequentially, and separated by a short pause. 50%of the customers were randomly assigned to be able to provide assistance through DSM in any givencombination of loads.5.3.3.4 Simulation AgentThe Simulation Agent hosted the electrical network model and supplied the Load Agents with voltageinformation via standard JADE messaging. The update process typically took 84ms, although it rangedfrom 40ms to 172ms, depending upon factors including number of agents, message queues and presenceof a sniffer used to examine network traffic. To contextualise this, 84ms is approximately 4 cycles at\u2013 145 \u20135.3. Results50Hz.5.3.3.5 Intention Transfer Dialogue TrialAn extract of communication recorded by JADE between the agents is shown reconstructed in Figure5.11.SA J13 J14J1 J12INFORMINFORMINFORMCONFIRMINFORMINFORMQUERY-IFFigure 5.11: Communications extractIn this dialogue (simplified here for clarity), the Load Agent J14 (located at Load14, Figure 3.15)broadcasts its intention with an INFORM message:(implies(B J14@pwrsvr (LocalVoltage J14 0.939))(I J14 (B J14 lvgtll)))The \u201cimplies\u201d operator is used to connect the belief that the local voltage is under 0.94 p.u. with the in-tention to bring about the truth of the proposition lvgtll (an abbreviation of \u201cLocal Voltage Greater ThanLower Limit\u201d). This helps other agents to determine priority of this control effort. J13 (correspondinglylocated at Load13) accepts and adopts this intention. It waits a few milliseconds before responding, andthen sends J14 the following QUERY-IF:(B J14 lvgtll))Since the voltage at J14 is still below the statutory limit, the lvgtll proposition is not true. J14 returnsa DISCONFIRM message with the same content. J13 reasons that since it still believes the propositionis false, it takes action to remedy the voltage excursion, and sends a message to the Simulation Agentthat it has switched off. Agents J10 and J11 also assist before the voltage at J14 can be updated to beabove 0.94 p.u. Agents which subsequently query the truth of lvgtll are sent a CONFIRM; because theend condition of intention has been fulfilled, the intention is dropped and no further action is taken. A\u2013 146 \u2013Chapter 5. Multi-Agent Systems for LVDN Controlfew minutes after this event has occurred, J13 refreshes its belief base (not shown) by performing thesame QUERY-IF; J14 confirms the proposition has become true, and J13 returns to normal operation.In a single operation to resolve a voltage event, 25 messages were generated between the load agentswithin 1500ms. ACL and FIPA-SL running on the JADE messaging system has a fairly low data density;content ranged from 82B \u20133kB, with approximately 500B of additional metadata per message. This isindicative of a minimum required connection speed of 120kb/s. Whilst this was by no means a problemfor either test system, consideration needs to be given to network bandwidth and latency in future smartgrids. Implementation of multicasting for the voltage contingency announcement would reduce bandwidthrequirements, and is now supported in JADE[176]. Whilst message size could be reduced, data structuresare constrained by the FIPA standards which trade large message sizes for flexibility, clarity and openness.One problem that arose during development was that all low-priority loads would switch off simul-taneously in order to assist network operation. This was mitigated by the use of a nearest-neighbouranalysis: agents calculated a delay before action, arbitrarily based on local proximity to a belief of theremote voltage. Agents linked closer proximity on the network with better ability to assist. This provideda partial solution.The number of DSM switching events was dependent upon the delay, a function of \u2206V 2 , and agentsin close proximity opted-in too rapidly for the SA to respond. By tuning this function, fewer switchingevents occurred. Voltage proximity is only a simplistic method to assess ability to assist, due to thecomplexities of LVDNs incorporating DER.5.3.4 Combined Load and GenerationAs a baseline, the system was trialled where no agents were able to assist. This yielded a baseline resultwhere generators disconnected themselves under the G83/1 regulations in the overvoltage case, and noloads were shed in the undervoltage case.The simulation was run for a set of use conditions which would ordinarily result in a combinationof 1\u20134 agents experiencing voltage excursions, occurring sequentially, and separated by a short pause.50% of the agents were randomly assigned to be able to provide assistance through DSM in any givencombination of loads. As designed, the combination of high demand and generation with an extendedfeeder resulted in the network simulation database supplying under- and overvoltages.Figure 5.12 shows the change in voltage at the end of the feeder during the first voltage limits excursionfor one combination of DSM availability for the load-only case. In this typical case, the voltage atthe end of the feeder (at Load14, Figure 3.15) dropped to 0.939 p.u. This lasted 360ms. The agentsat Load10, Load11 and Load13 assisted and the voltage was raised in three steps to 0.972 p.u. Theexcursion in which the voltage at Load12, Load13 and Load14 was below limits lasted 220ms wherethe agents at Load9, Load10 and Load11 assisted to raise the voltage to 0.963 p.u. Agents refreshed\u2013 147 \u20135.3.

This resulted intwo new network behaviours which were dependent upon the random DSM assignments. In some trials,subsequent undervoltages were avoided entirely because agents continued to assist for a short time periodafter the contingency was solved. Some trials exhibited an additional (but less severe) undervoltage whenan assisting agent returned to its original state. Further tests with reduced load diversity showed anincreased response time as more remote agents assisted. As an indication of the ability of the system tocontrol DG, the G83/1 threshold of 1500ms was never exceeded if sufficient cooperation was available.As diversity reduced and fewer loads could assist, this situation became more probable. A maximum of30% of customers with the ability to switch off was sufficient to guarantee voltage restoration; normally,fewer were required. The scheme operated in a similar fashion when GAs were included, with the systemreducing the number of generator disconnections.Without the control approach, the 4 LV network nodes at the remote end of the feeder (representing38 customers) would have experienced breaches of the statutory voltage limits under the test scheme.With the distributed multi-agent control system, some breaches were avoided entirely, no breach exceeded1500ms, and was typically resolved with 3 DSM switchoff events.Over the course of development a significant issue was discovered in the JADE platform: in the defaultimplementation, the execution of some agent behaviour could be prevented by the existence of other re-curring behaviours. The Scheduler class in the JADE libraries determines execution of behaviours (plans,intentions and any other routines). However, it does not guarantee execution. If the final behaviour inthe execution list (readyBehaviours) adds a new behaviour, that new behaviour is not executed in thecurrent cycle around the list. A patch was written for the the JADE 3.7 libraries to fix two serious bugsin the behaviour scheduler. Routines to demonstrate the errors and relevant patches were circulated tothe open-source community and are included in Appendices B.1 to B.3.\u2013 148 \u2013Chapter 5.

The embedded controllers were connected to thesimulated electrical network at the points indicated in Figure 5.13(b). The physical analogue outputs ofthe RTDS supplied the voltage waveforms of the simulated electrical network at the load points indicatedto agents (labelled J1-J14) hosted on the embedded controller test rig.500MVAGrid Equivalent Source  33.0 kV /  11.5 kV1.125kmDistributionlineCustomer lumped loadsFeeder lumped loadsStudy Feeder: 17 customers and 185mm2 distribution line1\u03c6 3\u03c6 11kV lumped loads11.5kV / 0.4kV(a) Real-time testing: network overviewJ2(0,2)J1(0,1)J4(0,4)J6(0,6)J3(0,3)J5(0,5)J8(0,8)J7(0,7)J10(0,10)J12(0,12)J9(0,9)J11(0,11)J14(0,14)J13(0,13)Fixed-use customersSingle-phase, single customer domestic loads+Agent controllersTo Phase A of 0.4kV busbar(b) Real-time testing: study feederFigure 5.13: Real-time network overview and agent controller connectionsThe UK Generic LVDN, implemented in RSCAD and shown simplified in a) was integrated into theRTDS.

However, in the lab environment, the\u2013 149 \u20135.3. Resultsproximity of the devices to each other meant that the margin of error in GPS measurement overlapped.The receivers were placed sequentially in a line approximately North-South. Figure 5.15 shows thereported arrangement of the controllers, in which the order was not maintained. Subsequent to confirmingthat the Beagleboards could collect and use real GPS data, the capability to supply arbitrary coordinatesto the controllers was used to specify the relevant test geometry.Load Agent G1Current location 54.7671439 -1.569591591Initialised arrayfinished all setupFigure 5.14: Debug output from GPS-enabled agent1.5692 1.5694 1.5696 1.5698 1.57 1.5702 1.5704 1.570654.766954.767154.767354.76751 23 456 78910111213LongitudeLatitudeFigure 5.15: GPS coordinate overlaps of controllers in labThe figure shows the reported locations of controllers 1-13.

For consistency, the agents used supplied coordinates after thesuccessful GPS testing in Section 5.3.5.2.

Edge weightsare omitted for clarity.Agent J1 entered the system first of all. With no other agents to map, and no whisper protocol yetimplemented to perform graph updates (as per Section 4.14), it is the only member of its graph. Figure5.18(b) shows a sub-graph from the middle of the feeder. Figure 5.18(c) shows the graph for the agentJ14 at the remote end: when the agent calculates the distance between J12-J14, the result (222.4) islonger than the other two, and consequently no edge is inserted. The two nearest neighbours thus forma path to the left. These demonstrate the successful application of the geographical algorithm developedin Section 4.2.1 on the embedded hardware platform.5.3.5.4 Voltage AcquisitionThe break-out box, voltage acquisition daugterboard, and driver software on the embedded controllerswere successfully integrated into the agent design.

A successful demonstration would show the complete process from agent registration and locationderivation, to voltage monitoring, to control action, and through to resolution of the network event.The demand profile of the customers on the feeder was designed in order to create heavy loading (asdescribed in Section 3.3.1) whilst remaining realistic. This loading would create a voltage dip outsideof regulatory limits; control agents would demonstrate restoration to within limits compared to theno-control case.With the overall setup as described in Section 5.3.5.1, the set of load control agents J1-J14 wereinitiated and the agent actions logged.To examine the behaviour of the system, the interactions between the agent J14 and J13 and theplatform are shown here: the full process diagram is shown in 5.20. The first actions after initiation areshown on the left: agent registration and graph building.

The statutory lower voltage limit (0.94p.u.) is shownwith a loose-dashed line. The voltage experienced by the agent dips below acceptable limits between theexcursion start and end vertical bars at t=517ms and t=1688ms. The voltage for no control action isprojected with a dashed line to t=2117ms.Shortly after t=517ms, agent J14 contacted J13, the agent directly adjacent on the feeder, to requestassistance, as per the dialog visible in Figure 5.20. J13 was well-placed to assist, since its impact onvoltage is higher than those closer to the busbar. It determined to assist; it reconfirmed the necessityof action (to reduce excessive control actions from voltage transients), then delayed its EV charging fora time, reducing network load. This process occurred for 6 agents requesting assistance from adjacentagents almost simultaneously (not shown), and resulted in 4 controller switching operations. There wasless communication in this case compared to the proof-of-concept system: the agent only messaged withits connected agents, rather than the entire pool.At t=1688ms, the voltage was restored to within limits: a duration of 1150ms from the originalexcursion. This restoration time falls within the range of 220-1500ms of the combined system shown in\u2013 154 \u2013Chapter 5. Multi-Agent Systems for LVDN ControlSection 5.3.4, and is within the 1600ms requirement of the regulation G83/1[9]. Without the controllerswitching events, the system would have continued in the undervoltage condition: the lower dashed lineon the right of Figure 5.22 shows system voltage projected for no controller action until 1600ms after theinitial undervoltage, where disconnection of SSEG becomes mandatory,In the solution by Trichakis [1] (as discussed in Section 2.3.2.3), where the full network geometry isstored in a preconfigured centralised database, a voltage excursion developed between t=0.5s \u2013 t=1.0s,and was resolved by t=1.015s; (i.e. in the range 15 \u2013 515ms).Consequently, these results show a successful demonstration of the location-aware decentralised MASavoiding disconnection under G83/1, and with the new solution providing comparable response times andwith increased decentralisation over the Trichakis implementation through a dynamic network topologycreation process.5.3.6 DiscussionIn terms of the control system itself, the gaps in the literature highlighted in the earlier chapters can berevisited in this context.Over the course of the work, strengths, limitations and weaknesses were found for the system andeach of the test facilities. One key issue is around fairness and switching operations, particularly sincethe DSM scheme is not sophisticated.Each iteration of testbed contributed to the development of the control system, and the testing facilityitself should also be evaluated.5.3.6.1 Research ChallengesThe system was developed to take account of each of the following strands of the research challengeoutlined in Section 2.4:\u0088 Decentralised controlThe agents form congregations and take individual control actions. No centralised controller ispresent. The rudimentary control techniques proved useful for maintaining voltage within limits.\u0088 Multi-goalThe multi-stakeholder context included voltage as a control goal without sacrificing customer equip-ment use priorities. Whilst the location could be useful in tackling voltage unbalance, as of writingthis functionality was not implemented.\u0088 Market-independentThe future scenario included a regulatory setup in which the agents were collaborative. Markets\u2013 155 \u20135.3. Resultswere not used. However, some flexibility is lost since agents cannot be offered compensation toincentivise action\u0088 Towards \u201czero\u201d configurationThe only configuration required by the control agents was their use profile, which would either beset up in the ordinary course of equipment use (such as setting heating times for a HP) or wouldemerge from their function such as PV output. Upon startup, the agents automatically derivedlocation and used that information in a control system without additional user intervention.\u0088 ScalableLocal congregations of agents with connection graphs can be used to create groups of appropri-ate size, but the impacts of larger numbers of agents were not quantified. The supercomputerimplementation was developed to allow testing at scale to be performed for future systems.\u0088 ResilientThe agent platform ran in a fault-tolerant mode. The opt-in basis for agent action operated over thetop of an existing disconnection regulation regime, allowing the system to fall back onto predefinedsafety standards in the case of outage or component failure.\u0088 Standards-compliantRelevant multi-agent standards were applied throughout development and all the system compo-nents were open-source, ensuring that interoperability (including third-party developments) can beguaranteed into the future.5.3.6.2 Fairness and EquityAn agent delayed assistance by waiting for a time specified by a function of the difference between itsown voltage and that of an agent announcing a problem. This worked for the simple linear feeder in thissimulation, but this technique is flawed for real-world cases. Firstly, it takes no account of three-phaseoperation, which could contribute to unbalance problems or just result in ineffective DSM switchingevents. These should be avoided, since any switching operation can be seen as a reduction in supplyquality. Secondly, it does not adjust well to branching networks, where a node may be close to another involtage but not in network location, reducing the effectiveness of its assistance. Agents which are awareof network location are able to make better decisions; whilst the voltage-difference method is a goodstart, better information could improve network operation and improve agent plug-and-play capability.Finally, it means that agents at the remote end of the feeder assist disproportionately more: whilst thismay be a more technically effective solution, it is not an equitable one.Although the delay function was effective in producing an improved voltage profile, it requires tuning.\u2013 156 \u2013Chapter 5. Multi-Agent Systems for LVDN ControlFor an agent close to a voltage problem, the differences in delay to assistance is not significant comparedto the inter-agent message latency; as a result, several agents may assist in cases where one would besufficient. This tuning is case-specific, however. It would require extensive testing to attempt to specifya generally-optimised catch-all-cases function.5.3.6.3 Test FacilityInitially, ubiquitous control was considered to be unrealistic on grounds of cost; the use of inexpensive,general-purpose hardware now gives scope for a variety of agent applications where direct control wouldbe prohibitively expensive but small-scale actions can be aggregated into providing real value.The specific application developed was for domestic control on LVDNs, but the embedded controllerplatform has wider relevance: the facility can host control agents written for any item of equipmentrepresented in the RTDS, whether at transmission or distribution level, and read from and feed back intothe RTDS for closed-loop operation. Separately from this work, the RTDS has been linked to a PAS 20004-quadrant power amplifier, allowing items of equipment (at the 400V level) to interact with a physicallysimulated network, such that the multi-agent system can incorporate both real and simulated equipmentin closed-loop operation, increasing the value of the facility yet further.Consequently, the test rigs are a new resource for testing communicating energy resource controllersin the MAS paradigm. The implementation of a combination of real-time simulation with hardware-in-the-loop controllers and a networked MAS is a significant development as a smart grid test resource.5.4 ConclusionsIn the first part of this chapter, the multi-agent system paradigm was examined, in particular whenconsidering the power systems domain. After considering various societal structures, techniques in groupinteraction were explored. The novel technique of Intention Transfer was presented as a tool in coordi-nating a nonhierarchical, decentralised agent control system. It was argued that the INTEND2 form ismore flexible and appropriate for describing group action. These approaches were combined to producethe design of new control agents \u2014 software entities that can be applied across multiple control goalsand which use their communicative and social abilities within a society in order to assist it in solving acontrol problem.A novel MAS was developed to control SSEZ entities in a fully decentralised fashion. The design wasimplemented and tested on several iterations of new multi-agent test rigs.Intention Transfer proved to be a successful original technique to facilitate opt-in-based operation[164].The use of network inference through location identification proved to be a useful new tool in control[177].The agents were plug-and-play capable, requiring no technical configuration; this aspect is valuedas a way to lower barriers to implementation and warrants further investigation. The MAS achieved\u2013 157 \u20135.4. Conclusionsan improvement in network operation from the existing G83/1 regulations in terms of customer voltagelevels and reduced contingency durations, and improved the availability of SSEG through the reduction ofmandatory disconnections. This facilitates integration of controllable loads and high SSEG penetrations;it adds value for DG owners and may delay network reinforcement for DNOs.The final embedded controller platform was demonstrated to be an effective new test facility formulti-agent systems and will be a useful resource in the field of smart grid develoment.\u2013 158 \u2013Chapter 6ConclusionThis thesis began with an introduction to the challenges of integrating DER and the motivation andcontext for research in the area. The state of the art and its shortcomings were examined by reviewingthe literature in Chapter 2, and this was used to devise requirements for the solution to the problem inSection 2.4. In Chapter 3, theory was outlined to explain electrical phenomena, indicating the significanceof network topology. The link between topology and ideas of location were developed in Chapter 4 as wellas techniques for deriving topology. Decentralised control was examined in Chapter 5 through the useof Multi-Agent System techniques. Test facilities were created to study the results of the control systemdevised to solve the Research Problem (in Section 2.4) in the context of the importance of locationin network operation. The development of these facilities was also described in Chapter 5, and theimplementation of location-aware agents was documented and evaluated.In this chapter, the progress made in each of the preceding chapters is reviewed. It includes discussionof the wider implementation of control systems using location and their use in the move from legacy,passive LVDNs towards a truly smart grid. Finally, this thesis concludes with a summary of its outcomes.6.1 Research ContextThe integration of DERs is discussed in Chapter 1 in terms of the increase of renewable generation,electric vehicles and heat pumps at the domestic level. It describes the legacy network of the UK and itsregulatory framework in which which these new technologies must operate. The key technical constraintsare explained in Chapter 2. Of these, voltage rise and drop and unbalance are specifically highlighted,for two reasons: they are the top two on the list of electrical barriers to higher penetrations of DG, andbecause the G83/1 regulations specify that DG must disconnect in undervoltage conditions where theycould instead be used to support the network. A solution to voltage rise and drop would facilitate widerSSEG uptake and can add value across stakeholders: economically, a producer would continue to supply\u2013 159 \u20136.1. Research Context\u2014 and therefore sell \u2014 electricity, and a network operator would be able to defer network reinforcementcosts; environmental benefits occur from maximising the potential output of low-carbon generation. Thevoltage unbalance issue does not have the same disconnection requirements for DG owners under G83/1,but are a wider issue of power quality that could result in customer equipment damage if left unchecked.The voltage rise and drop issues are linked to voltage unbalance electrically as explained in Chapter 3.The context and review combine to givea summary statement of the problem:\u201c...there remains no system that simultaneously addresses the major technical problems ofDG integration into a market-free, demand-driven legacy network context whilst also captur-ing the full benefits of a multi-agent solution. Consequently, a scalable, network-independent,decentralised control system for operation of an evolving network with multiple system con-straints remains an open research problem. \u201dThe set of criteria for evaluating the solution have been identified as:\u0088 Decentralised control\u0088 Multi-goal \u2014 operating across multiple technical constraints\u0088 Market-independent\u0088 Towards \u201czero\u201d configuration \u2014 for \u201cplug-and-play\u201d operation\u0088 Scalable\u0088 Resilient\u0088 Standards-compliantThe scoping of this work was co-developed with industry partner E.ON through the EPSRC CASE(Cooperative Awards in Science and Technology) mechanism. This approach highlighted some of theseregulatory issues and specific technical challenges. It also helped guide some implementation decisions.Some of these were related to system structure (for example, the examination of the multi-stakeholdercontext and the decision to investigate a non-market-based approach), whereas others were related to low-level implementation (such as the use of a passive monitoring approach to detect electrical connections,rather than an active approach such as a controller placing a signal onto the electrical network for othersto detect). These considerations evolving from industry feedback were useful to provide some focus areasover and above those provided by the gaps identified in the literature.\u2013 160 \u2013Chapter 6. Conclusion6.2 Location in LVDNsThe theory underpinning the voltage rise/voltage drop phenomenon and voltage unbalance was intro-duced in Chapter 3. The relationship between network impedance and voltage changes caused by DERconnection was explained using this theory. Since the impedance increases with length of distributionline, the distance between equipment is related to the voltage drop between them. The effects of phaseunbalance in three-phase networks were also explored. This analysis demonstrated that distributionnetwork topology is important for understanding and solving the constraints on DER integration.The UK Generic Network in the existing literature was examined as a benchmark electrical networkand was used to create new models of legacy distribution networks incorporating widespread DER, whichwere implemented as research tools for this work using several software packages. The resulting modelsdemonstrated the problems outlined in Chapter 2 in line with the theory.IPSA+ modelling is valid for static, balanced operation. The new model was used for aggregatedgroups of customers and was scripted to provide an exhaustive database of operating points which couldbe used as in software simulation.In part due to the limitations of balanced analysis, the model was also implemented in RSCAD \u2014this implementation included modelling down to individual customers. This model could be translatedto the real-time digital simulator for use in the test rig described in Chapter 5.The combination of theory and models provided demonstration of technical issues related to locationand tools for analysing and testing solutions.6.3 Location in ControlAn order of priority for barriers to DER is described in the literature review. From a control perspective,this starts with voltage drop and rise and phase unbalance. There are constraints on these phenomenaimposed by regulation. Control of the network was considered in the context of maintaining operationwithin these regulations in non-fault conditions.The electrical properties are related to the control aims. Ideas of location are developed in Chapter4 by drawing parallels between electrical properties \u2014 especially topology \u2014 and geographical position,such as the analogy between impedance and distance.Initial attempts to identify connection types by using instantaneous voltage measurements showedlimited success, so electrical connection was determined by measuring voltage over a 24-hour period andcomparing it through cross-correlation; test data were collected from the real distribution network inmultiple locations at 10s resolution through household energy monitors to demonstrate applicability insmart meter-like hardware and were used to establish criteria in determining connection type.\u2013 161 \u20136.4. Multi-Agent SystemsConnection between entities was examined through graph representation of electrical networks. Fi-nally, a method was devised to create a graph of proximate nodes by finding geographical location andconfirming electrical connection; the nodes are connected by edges weighted with a (distance, connectiontype, correlation peak magnitude) 3-tuple suitable for voltage and current control purposes.6.4 Multi-Agent SystemsThe multi-agent system paradigm was explored conceptually to establish its applicability for the researchproblem. It was argued in Chapter 5 that the MAS paradigm provides a framework for decentralisation,dependent upon societal structure, and highlighted the use of congregations in this application. Coop-eration and collaboration were examined, including game-theoretic aspects, although the use of marketswas excluded.The agent INTEND attitude can be expressed in two forms: commitment to a specific action, orcommitment to a state having been achieved. The argument was made that the latter form is moreflexible and appropriate. Formal descriptions of INTEND2 were used to develop a novel opt-in systemfor voltage control. In particular, the agents in this system use their communicative and social abilitieswithin a society in order to assist in solving a control problem.6.5 ApplicationThe prospect of ubiquitous computing makes the use of agents in diverse electrical equipment ever morelikely. With the advent of low-cost small-form-factor general-purpose computers, agents may be moreeasily deployed.The multi-agent system was combined with location techniques to create a solution to the researchproblem. Three test facilities were created in the development of the system: a proof-of-concept computernetwork demonstrating Intention Transfer, a cluster supercomputer using load and generator agents ona larger electrical network, and an embedded controller platform featuring real-time electrical networksimulation interfaced with controller hardware with real signal I/O and including GPS capability.In the course of test facility development, patches were developed for the industry-standard JADEplatform. Hardware modules were designed and manufactured to interface the embedded controllers withthe RTDS I/O signals. The testbed developed for the MAS trials provided a unique and vital resource.The system demonstrated successful recovery from voltage excursions using an opt-in demand-sidemanagement approach. The system used a form of location in agent configuration in each incarnation,and ultimately used geographical coordinates to construct a connection graph which was then used todetermine messaging and control action to resolve a voltage excursion within the G83/1 time limits,improving the economic and environmental benefits of the connected microgeneration and delaying the\u2013 162 \u2013Chapter 6. Conclusionneed for network reinforcement.6.6 Future WorkA method for confirming the presence of an electrical connection is set out in 4.3. Progress was madetowards implementing this method using the embedded controller test rig, but has not yet been fullyrealised. Consequently, the immediate next step for this work would be a demonstration of the integrationof both the GPS and electrically-derived location information in the same agent, incorporating the overlayof connection information for combined voltage/current control. A structured investigation of the effectsof network geometry in test scenarios would then give more confidence in the specific algorithm forderiving network graphs.The embedded controller platform currently exists on an ICT network that is isolated from the Hamil-ton Cluster. Connecting the two networks would provide significant additional value: as well as agentshosted on the RTDS-connected embedded controllers, an agent society of thousands could feasibly betested \u2014 even connecting agent-based human behavioural models to equipment controller models toelectrical network models end-to-end. Some electrical signals could be supplied to agents on the cluster(through an abstraction layer similar to the Simulation Agent used in this work, rather than hardware-in-the-loop). This would create an at-scale testbed across the full spectrum of the power system.Machine learning is briefly discussed in Section 4.1.5.2. Use of confidence factors in different locationmeasures, as well as evaluating the effectiveness of previous control interventions, can allow an agentto improve its graph over time and future decisions. This rationalising process creates intelligence incontrol \u2014 a further project implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques is therefore the nextstep to a network of agents incorporating automatic configuration, location-based, adaptive and socialdecision-making in a truly smart grid.6.7 Wider implications of researchThis study was focused on the area of small-scale DER at household voltages, but the relevance to industryof the central themes of this work go wider than this specific application. At any level within electricalnetworks, there are control issues where network topology is significant; the wider issue addressed by thiswork is that that deriving location and using it in a multi-agent system in the power domain is feasibleand useful.The multi-agent system testing explored in this work was not feasible before the construction of theembedded controller test rig. Again, such a system has wider application: the RTDS allows for simulationof arbitrary electrical networks (including at the transmission level as well as for LVDNs), the platform canbe configured for any geographical arrangement of equipment, with an industry-standard MAS platform\u2013 163 \u20136.8. Summaryand general-purpose, low-cost controller hardware. This facility represents considerable progress towardsa fuller exploitation of agent capabilities throughout electrical power systems.6.8 SummaryThis work argues that location is an important aspect for the control and integration of distributedenergy resources. It identifies various sources of location data and develops new geographical and electricaltechniques for deriving network topology using GPS and 24-hour voltage logs. It examines the multi-agentsystem paradigm and societal structures as an approach to a multi-stakeholder domain, and concludes thatthe decentralised context is best served by a nonhierarchical approach, in which this non-market-basedimplementation indicates the congregation structure. Through formal description of the agent attitudeINTEND2, the novel technique of Intention Transfer was applied to an agent congregation to provide anopt-in, collaborative system. Test facilities for multi-agent systems were developed and culminated in anew embedded controller test platform that integrated a real-time dynamic electrical network simulatorto provide a full-feedback system with control hardware in-the-loop. Finally, a multi-agent control systemwas developed and implemented that used location data in the process of providing demand-side responseto a voltage excursion, with the goals of improving power quality, reducing generator disconnectionsand deferring network reinforcement. The resulting communicating and self-organising energy agentcommunity, as demonstrated on a unique hardware-in-the-loop platform, provides an application modeland test facility to inspire agent-based, location-aware smart grid applications across the power systemsdomain.\u2013 164 \u2013References[1] P.

However, it does not guarantee execution. If the final behaviour in the executionlist (readyBehaviours) adds a new behaviour, that new behaviour is not executed in the current cyclearound the list. But if the penultimate behaviour in readyBehaviours adds a new behaviour, that newbehaviour is executed in this cycle. This is because the next behaviour is selected before the current onehas been executed. We can see this with the following code:pub l i c c l a s s BuggyAgent extends Agent{protec ted void setup ( ){System . out . p r i n t l n (\u201d He l lo World ! \u201d ) ;addBehaviour (new CPUEater ( ) ) ;}pub l i c c l a s s CPUEater extends Cycl icBehaviour{i n t i =0;pub l i c void ac t i on ( ){System . out . p r i n t l n (\u201d I t e r a t i o n \u201d+ i ) ;\u2013 185 \u2013B.1. Round-Robin Bugi f ( i ==5){addBehaviour (new Ender ( ) ) ;}i ++;}}pub l i c c l a s s Ender extends OneShotBehaviour{pub l i c void ac t i on ( ){System . out . p r i n t l n (\u201dEnd ! \u201d ) ;myAgent . doSuspend ( ) ;}}}A correctly-implemented scheduler should terminate on the 5th iteration; however, it does not. Thiscan be solved by calculating currentIndex immediately before it is used:current Index = ( current Index + 1)Behaviour b = ( Behaviour ) readyBehaviours . get ( current Index ) ;r e turn b ;instead ofBehaviour b = ( Behaviour ) readyBehaviours . get ( current Index ) ;current Index = ( current Index + 1)return b ;Then currentIndex must be initialised to -1 throughout.\u2013 186 \u2013Appendix B. JADE Behaviour Scheduler bugsB.2 Skipping behaviourscurrentIndex is not decremented if the behaviour removed is the current one, eg. in a call to block().As a result, we end up skipping over behaviours. The following code misses out behaviour Third.pub l i c c l a s s StepOver extends Agent{pub l i c F i r s t a = new F i r s t ( ) ;pub l i c Second b = new Second ( ) ;pub l i c Third c = new Third ( ) ;pub l i c Fourth d = new Fourth ( ) ;p ro tec ted void setup ( ) {addBehaviour ( a ) ;addBehaviour (b ) ;addBehaviour ( c ) ;addBehaviour (d ) ;}pub l i c c l a s s F i r s t extends Cycl icBehaviour{pub l i c void ac t i on ( ){System . out . p r i n t l n ( \u201d 1 \u201d ) ;}}pub l i c c l a s s Second extends Cycl icBehaviour{pub l i c void ac t i on ( ){System . out . p r i n t l n ( \u201d 2 \u201d ) ;b lock ( ) ;}}pub l i c c l a s s Third extends Cycl icBehaviour{\u2013 187 \u2013B.2. Skipping behaviourspub l i c void ac t i on ( ){System . out . p r i n t l n ( \u201d 3 \u201d ) ;}}pub l i c c l a s s Fourth extends Cycl icBehaviour{pub l i c void ac t i on ( ){System . out . p r i n t l n ( \u201d 4 \u201d ) ;myAgent . doSuspend ( ) ;}}}As a result, we needi f ( index <= current Index ){\u2212\u2212current Index ;}Now, If the behaviour removed is the final one, theni f ( index == current Index && current Index == readyBehaviours . s i z e ( ) ){current Index = \u22121;}causes us further problems, because the scheduler will skip over one more behaviour added at the endif we callremoveBehaviour ( t h i s ) ;addBehaviour (new endbehaviour ( ) ) ;We can safely remove this, because currentIndex has already been decremented, and then the fixedround robin algorithm correctly handles going past the end of the readyBehaviours list.\u2013 188 \u2013Appendix B.

      "abstract": "The quickening propensity of growth within the areas of information and communications technology and energy networks has triggered the emergence of a central idea termed as Internet of Energy (IoE). Such a concept relates the internet of things, which is the term used in describing the usage of sophisticated digital control devices with the capability of transmitting data via IT systems. The concept of an interconnected energy network is being formed in the upcoming days through upgrades in the field of intelligent energy systems to control real-time energy optimization and management. The energy industry has had a sustained expansion, reaching the IoE milestone and continuing to this cutting-edge power system, which is the next generation of IoE. A directional pathway from the traditional power system to the IoE has been conducted in this research work by addressing the importance of integrating the smart transmission and communication infrastructure, smart metering, pricing and energy management scheme. A detailed investigation of the IoE with respect to technical angles, such as communication architecture, IoE on the supply & demand side, and IoE protocol based on fundamental elements and essential technologies has been carried out to indicate the blueprint and jurisdiction complexity.

Introduction The improvement of the technology on which our existence now primarily depends is one way that the world seeks to propel nations toward the progress of life. Technical innovation aims to create new devices and appliances that will improve automation levels while also making human existence more dependable and pleasant. The world\u2019s population and technological growth rates have a variety of effects on the energy sector\u2019s dependability by driving up power usage pressure and consumption [1]. The traditional power system (TPS) possesses an ongoing integer of limitations. The TPS is often situated far from the consumers, necessitating a lengthy transference line to transmit elec-tricity. The unidirectional communication of this traditional system, which ignores user feedback, causes the power consumption pace and utility price to increase [2]. The manufacturing system of the TPS is highly reliant on non- restorable roots of power which are only found in minimal quantities worldwide. Thus, the day when natural resources are entirely gone from the earth is not far off [3]. The regulating and monitoring capabilities of various sections of TPS are made highly difficult and manual by employing few or no sensors in the TDS [1]. Additionally, the recovery of the power grid in the TPS against various faults or uncertainties is manual owing to the lack of intelligent and automated devices, which increases system complexity and lowers the main grid\u2019s management capacity [1]. A microgrid grid enters the scene as a solution to the problems of TPS. By providing clean and safe energy, the application of renewable energy (RE) origins in the MG helps to address the environmental de-mands while reducing the strain on natural resources [2]. The RE is a promising source that never runs out due to usage and whose demand is increasing daily due to its low cost, frequent acquisition, and recycling capabilities. The effectiveness and efficiency of RE sources are greatly influenced by environmental factors like wind speed and direction, temperature, and sun exposure, which change with the seasons and have various effects on the production of MG. To fill the gap left by one RE source in the functioning of MG and to manage a consistent and dependable power source for the end users, some RE sources and ESS may be installed concurrently [4]. Smart grid (SG) fills the gaps left by both TPS and MG thanks to its two-way communication capabilities in the electricity sector. The smart metering system in the SG evaluates the end users\u2019 power use and chooses an advantageous bill based on dynamic charging, communi-cated to the consumers and distributor to make decisions on the scheduling of the load and generation [3]. With ICT and IoT, various sensors are integrated with TPS in order to identify structure errors and take appropriate and innovative efforts to rectify them accordingly. The security concerns across various units, such as EMS, smart meters (SM), and dynamic pricing, are carefully monitored and managed to improve the power system\u2019s dependability, resilience, quality, and efficiency and make it more resilient and adaptable [5]. Due to the complicated infrastructure and security concerns, a sig-nificant amount of DER integration in the MG or SG makes regulating the parameters outline more complicated. Another enhancement of the SG that lessens the integration complexity of DER and combines several DER units is the virtual power plant (VPP). It can function as a full- fledged unit with a number of capabilities [6]. VPPs offer significant benefits over TPS regarding adequate transfer infrastructure, substantial Nomenclature ICT Information and communication technology IoE Internet of energy IoT Internet of things TPS Traditional power system TDS Transmission and distribution system RE Renewable energy ESS Energy storage system EMS Energy management system DER Distributed generation resource SG Smart grid MG Microgrid VPP Virtual power plant SM Smart meter DRER Distributed renewable energy resources CPS Cyber-physical system FREEDM Future renewable electric energy delivery and management PV Photovoltaic WT Wind turbine DGI Distributed grid intelligence IEM Internet equipment Management FID Fault isolation device SST Solid-state transformer P2P Peer-to-peer WPAN Wireless personal area network RFID Radio frequency identification Wi-Fi Wireless-fidelity LAN Local area network TCP/IP Transmission control protocol/internet protocol MAC Medium access control UDP User datagram protocol HY Hydropower FC Fuel cell IEC Intelligent energy controller USP User services platform V2G Vehicle to grid PP Plug-and-play DESD Distributed energy storage devices SMI Smart meter infrastructure HAN Home area network MDMS Meter data management system OCPP Open charge point protocol OCPI Open charge point interface OADR Open automated DR DEVS Discrete event system specification AI Artificial intelligence GSM Global system for mobile DLP Dummy location privacy-preserving CA Cyber-attack MW Middleware DI Data integrity SCL Supply chain logistics FS Fog server CS Cloud server MLSTM Multilayer long short-term memory EV Electric vehicle AV Autonomous vehicle G2V Grid-to-vehicle GIS Geographic information system VPN Virtual private network DRP Demand response program IBP Incentive-based programs RTP Real-time pricing PEV Plug-in electric vehicle  M. Farhan et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Energy and AI 14 (2023) 1003063adaptable properties, and extreme regulatory structures [7]. Utilizing temporary communication technologies, this cloud-based control entity backed by ad-ministering software organizes the allocation of elec-tricity. The VPPs, however, have several shortcomings regarding intel-ligence and integrating disparate DERs into large dimensions. When considering the variety in dimensions, kind, and integration of energy resources and loads, the software associated with VPPs encounters several restrictions. Accurate modeling is necessary to inspect the diverse sectors of the energy structure. To manage the voltage, frequency, and power by strengthening the capacity of its TDS, communication network, Energy storage system, SM, and demand scale needs proper information. A critical possibility for modernizing the global energy network is inte-grating energy with the internet [8]. With rationalized power produc-tion and unidirectional energy flow replaced with more secure, dependable, structured, adaptable additionally sustainable energy net-works, the IoE marks a paradigm leap for the current grid structure [9]. The current model of centrally managed electricity production, communication, and delivery is at gunpoint to improve for different reasons, including concern for the environment, which is running away from huge coal and oil-fired producing systems and toward greater use of RE which requires DER assistance. IoE encompasses all types of en-ergy, including thermal and electrical ones, and aims to provide a reli-able mechanism for exchanging energy amongst prosumers, much like internet networks do. This will need extensive, sophisticated supervising and management of scattered and sporadic power generation and stor-age over the information highway [8]. Fig. 1 shows a detailed evolution from TPS to IoE. Research has been done on the IoE\u2019s beneficial applications and operations in several domains. The authors analyzed and contrasted contemporary energy and internet networks and services, highlighting key capabilities and outlining the major technological obstacles that must be overcome to convert the electricity distribution system into a flexible platform for the interchange of electrical energy. The numerous IoT applications, including their effects on power systems, are outlined in [10], which conducts a thorough review. The core terminology related to the IoT is defined in this work, including recognition, trans-mission, computing, definition, and services. The categorization for IoE utilization in all aspects of energy systems at different levels is addressed in [11]. The functions of IoT in smart grids have been investigated in [12]. A clear description of the many IoE levels in power systems is given in this paper. The demonstration of the necessity of IoT in electric cars is conducted in [13]. Ref. [14] introduces the energy management plans for electric car charging stations, and energy storage installations are presented. This field, however, is characterized by difficulties. The system\u2019s safety can be jeopardized by cyberattacks when innovations like IoT and cyber-physical systems are included in power systems, ac-cording to [15]. One of the difficulties highlighted in [16] is connecting various devices created by various standards and protocols under a sole IoT platform. The authors of [17] explored software-related difficulties with IoE. The aforementioned papers address the properties and applications of the IoT in power systems. The proper control structure, modeling, control issues and challenges with their respective solutions are not addressed in these papers. The principal grant of this research article is to focus on all aspects of the IoE that will help the research community to construct and control efficient management for the next-generation IoE for the future world. The aims and contribution of this research article can be listed as, 1.

Internet of energy: architecture & key technologies As opposed to traditional power grids, a smart grid is a significant concept that combines associated power grid structures, intelligent networks, and smart observation to dramatically improve energy resource use. There are, however, some flaws and restrictions. A new age of power supply approach, known as IoE, has been suggested to advance it. IoE creates a vision for the web\u2019s progression of smart grids that improves energy utilization efficiency, energy security, and dependability by combining dispersed and scalable sources based on smart grid [25]. It replaces concentrated power production and unidirectional power cir-culation with a more secure and sustainable energy web. A detailed comparison between TPS, MG, SG, VPP and IoE with addressing their applications has been highlighted in Table 1. 2.1. Architecture of IoE IoE is commonly referred to as an internet-based power system that integrates sources of energy and got all of the flaws of the current smart grid by combining energy and ICT as shown in Fig. 2 [26]. Major issues, including more eco-friendly energy supplies, innovative hybrid energy models, safer and more efcient power generation, and control systems, are often resolved by IoE [25,26]. The spine of the upcoming grid, according to the center of Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management (FREEDM), will be an advanced energy dispensation framework that may permit a \"plug- and-play\" combination of SG elements and bi-directional electricity flow. FREEDM is an advanced production of power transformers that uses power electronics to enable bi-directional energy flow [27]. Fig. 3 indicates the components of the FREEDM system. To ft the FREEDM system into the IoE power system, six key tech-nologies work together to build the system\u2019s core, such as distributed grid intelligence (DGI) Software, plug-and-play interface, intelligent energy management (IEM) software, solid-state transformer (SST), internet equipment management (IEM) device, and fault isolation device (FID). The plug-and-play technology enables the addition and deletion of DRERs and DESDs anywhere at any time and from any place. The IEM device establishes a data medium by continuously monitoring loads and other operational devices while accurately referencing each device\u2019s control. The IEM software aids in the investigation of DESD and DRER accessibility in the FREEDM system, as well as the computation of pricing data. DGI software provides useful load balancing by effectively transferring energy within load pressure, sustainable energy generation, and energy storage at each point. The SST could be utilized in lieu of typical distribution transformers. The FID provides system security and reliability for a system that is remote from the centralized grid system.

Energy and AI 14 (2023) 10030652.1.1. GRIP architecture Integrating a rising number of new grid participants: DRES, demand- side administration structure, and so on into the current functional approach is challenging. Operators are worried about uncertain demand response and unobservable generation from decentralized renewables. The millions of houses, buildings, and industries that make up the En-ergy Internet cannot be managed by the conventional centralized management model, which can manage numerous observation and authorization points. A new grid with an intelligent periphery, known as GRIP, has been suggested in reaction to these fundamental changes and is based on the three pillars. They are Layered architecture, abstracting commonality, and empowering the periphery. The clusters are orga-nized hierarchically in the GRIP architecture. Many substations, MG, and maybe industries make up a central transmission grid cluster; each is an individual bundle. A significant core cluster that houses multiple smaller MG, structures, and dwellings comprises a network branch as well as the related administration grid. There may be numerous clusters of smart houses and buildings inside a MG branch housed inside a substation cluster. Clusters are intelligent systems that can acquire actual-time information acquired from the SG, assess their status, take appropriate steps, and make operational control. Here, a basic design of three levels is recommended. The device layer includes sophisticated actuators and sensors. The devices are used by a superior layer known as the service layer to carry out particular services. The application layer sits on top and uses the services offered below to do the cluster\u2019s tasks. These tasks will be further discussed in the next section, including managing load and scheduling generation [28]. 2.1.2. Fog based architecture A fog-based architecture network is suggested to link IoE and fog nodes in smart cities. The fog calculating approach assists the IoE ele-ments by providing small latency, which speeds up data processing. A two-layer architecture is used here where the initial layers are made up of fog nodes and the second layer handles the traffic from IoE devices and lower latency [29].  \u2022 Fog Node Layer: By connecting smart city IoE devices to a fog computing environment, the service demands of the consumers may be satisfied. Several physical servers form the fog node, explicitly covering the diameter. Both cable and wireless media can be used to link the fog nodes. The components of a fog node include a CPU, configurable equipment methods, and network assistance. Intelligent sensors gather information about the immediate surroundings, and the fog node analyzes it in real-time and provides information that aids decision- making. Additionally, the fog node helps the radio access network by enabling unicast wireless communication within a specific range. The fog node, which offers storage for memory-based passive applications, can incorporate the local database. This offers the benefit of reduced processing and loading times for demanding IoT applications [30]. \u2022 IoE Layer: This layer is the ecosystem where users can deploy ap-plications without restrictions. IoT devices are grouped based on their location and what they can do. This contributes to a reduction in time, cost, and energy overheads. The need for processing and integration of software and hardware services will result in a rise in Table 1 (continued ) Technology Project name Component used Capacity CCET, Texas Solar system, Wind turbine, Hydropower 8500 MW ADELE, Germany Solar system, Wind turbine, Hydropower 200 MW C2C, UK Solar system, Wind turbine 152 MW Orkney Smart Grid, UK Solar system, Wind turbine 26 MW Decose, Italy Solar system, Hydropower 345 MW Edge, Denmark Solar system, Wind turbine, Hydropower 213 MW Hebei Electric Power Company, Hebei Solar system, Wind turbine, Hydropower 4590 MW Hunan Electric Power Company, Hunnan Solar system, Wind turbine, Hydropower 4500 GW SG [20] CESC, Mysore Solar system, Hydropower 152 GW UHBVN, Hatyana Solar system, Wind turbine, Hydropower 132 GW MSEDCL, Maharashtra Solar system, Hydropower 26.2 GW UGVCL, Gujrat Solar system, Wind turbine 1700 GW Jiangsu Electric Power Company, Nanjing Solar system, Wind turbine, Hydropower 12,700 GW Fujian Electric Power Company, Fujian Solar system, Wind turbine 6000 GW AEP Ohio, Ohio Solar system, Wind turbine 2954 MW Detroit Edison, Michigan Solar system, Wind turbine, Hydropower 11,084 MW APDCL, Assam Solar system 90 GW Narara Ecovillage Smart Grid, Narara Solar system, Wind turbine, Hydropower 471 KW Berrimal Wind Farm, Western Victoria Solar system, Wind turbine, Hydropower 72 MW Mortlake South Wind Firm, Victoria Solar system, Wind turbine 157 MW Aldoga Solar Firm, Queensland Solar system, Wind turbine, Hydropower 480 MW VPP [21, 22] FENIX, France Solar system, Wind turbine 150 MW VPP of Siemens Company, Germany Solar system, Hydropower 1450 MW Gresham House Energy Storage VPP, UK Solar system, Wind turbine 265 MW UK SMS VPP, UK Solar system, Hydropower 9 MW Hitachi ABB VPP, Singapore Wind turbine 2.4 MW Stategrids VPP, Jiangsu Solar system, Wind turbine 10 GW Ausgrid and Reposit VPP, New South Wales Solar system 10 MW Smart Energy Australia VPP, Victoria Solar system, Wind turbine, Hydropower 1 GW AGL Virtual Power Plant, Adelaide Solar system, Hydropower 5 MW Sonnen VPP, Italy Solar system, Hydropower 1 GW Pennsylvania Americal Water VPP, Pennsylvania Solar system, Hydropower 400 KW Detroit VPP, Michigan Solar system, Wind turbine 0.3 GW Wasatch Energy and Sonnen VPP, California Solar system, Wind turbine 0.06 GW Swell VPP, California Solar system, Hydropower 0.3 GW Shizen Energy VPP, Japan Wind turbine 5.3 KW IoE [23,24] Scottish Southern Energy, UK Wind turbine, Hydropower 1459 MW A2A, Chivasso Power Plant, Italy Coal, Fuel cell 1123 MW Beijing Jingkai Investment Development, China Coal 2.4 MW  Table 1 (continued ) Technology Project name Component used Capacity Zhangbei Herun Energy Co., Ltd., China Wind turbine, Hydropower 240 MW Jingneng Capital Energy Internet Project, China Wind turbine, Hydropower 424 KW Bord Gais, Ireland Wind turbine, Hydropower 445 KW Salt River Project, Arizona Wind turbine, Hydropower 232 MW  M.

Energy and AI 14 (2023) 1003066the burden of data centers. Peer-to-peer (P2P) TCP/IP transmission takes place when there is proximity between two IoT devices. These devices can connect to the fog node through WiFi, ZigBee, and Bluetooth-like protocols if they are far apart [31]. 2.1.3. IoE communication architecture The choice of a suitable IoT communication standard is critical since it determines how an IoT device will function. The proficiency of net-works and applications is influenced by the standards used [32]. Fig. 4 shows a detailed IoE communication architecture structure. Some standards for various situations and applications are discussed below:  \u2022 Bluetooth: Bluetooth is a communication standard that is used to create a wireless personal area network (WPAN) having various versions, including 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0. The most updated version is 4.0, known as Low Energy Bluetooth, and 5.0, which are developed primarily for IoT networks [32].  \u2022 Radio Frequency Identification: It uses radio wave frequencies in order to transmit physical item recognition. Tags are classified into two categories based on their power supply Active and Passive RFID tags. Active RFID is equipped with an uninterrupted power supply, like a battery, and can communicate with an RFID reader across extended distances [33]. Because of its modest size, RFID is well-suited for IoT integration.  \u2022 Wireless-Fidelity (Wi-Fi): In order to communicate within the internet and local area network (LANs), the majority of computer devices employ Wi-Fi. Currently, there are four versions of this standard: IEEE 802.11 a, b, g, and n, each having various speeds, ranges, and functioning techniques. Nowadays, Wi-Fi has turned into the prominent transmission architecture for the IoT environment due to the introduction of new standards, high speeds, and tiny sizes [32]. 2.1.3.1. Networking protocol. The protocols applied in every node of a dispersed network must be stated to activate communications. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or Internet Protocol (IP) based communication technologies now in use offer a sufficient amount of bandwidth for real-time observation and the management of an intelli-gent power system. It can also set up its own \"utility-Internet\" having complete authorization over the connection with improved privacy and dependability. The primary leveled protocols which might be utilized to implement IoE are discussed in this section [34]. Table 2 shows various network protocol layers.  \u2022 Link layer/ Terminal layer: The medium for data transit is the Physical Layer (L1), where the connection between two nodes is Data Layer (L2). Regarding wired technologies, the Ethernet protocol (IEEE 802.3) is typically used in SG control systems for quick and Fig. 2. Architecture of energy internet.  Fig. 3. The FREEDM system elements.  M. Farhan et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Energy and AI 14 (2023) 1003067dependable work. Nevertheless, the price to construct this kind of system is high for remote connections. The Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol, an L2 link layer sublayer, and the Ethernet protocol are frequently connected [35].  \u2022 Data communication layer/ Internet layer: The united power distribution and authorization system has diverse requirements for communication speed, bandwidth, latency, and equipment cost, making it difficult to choose suitable communication technology. The Internet Layer (L3) regulates how packet relaying works by allocating addresses to nodes and scattering frames through chan-nels. Because IP can function freely of the basic physical layer, L1 and L2 layers, any two terminal locations connected by a minimum of one or more webworks supplying a data link among them are connectable by end-to-end SG apps [35,36].  \u2022 Platform layer/ Transport layer: Host-to-host connections are possible thanks to transport protocols (L4). User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and TCP are both the most used transport layer protocols that deliver a stream of packets between applications in a reliable, orderly, and error-checked manner. The design specifications depend on the weighting of velocity and reliability and the requirement for error detection. TCP is the ideal choice since the power system application needs dependable connections. Instead, TCP\u2019s limitations in performing congestion control for several data sources and its naturally delayed acknowledgement may make it inefficient for SMG management, leading to unnecessary packet retransmissions and performance deterioration [37]. Specially adapted Multi-Path Transport Protocol, and Scalable Secure Trans-port Protocol can overcome these problems.  \u2022 Application layer: The protocols that facilitate process-to-process connections are found in the application layer (L7), which serves as both the client and application access points. It includes widely used features, including file sharing, directory services, electronic messaging, and remote file access. Domain Name Service, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol and Network Time Protocol are Fig. 4. A basic architecture for IoE communication network.  Table 2 Highlights of different network protocols.

Farhan et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Energy and AI 14 (2023) 1003068examples of application protocols that can be utilized for IoE network administration. International standards have been estab-lished for achieving synergy within this layer regarding MG. IEC 61,850 is a great auspicious quality for designing energy communi-cation networks [38]. 2.1.3.2. SDN network architecture. This modeling introduces a new de-vice named Intelligent Energy Controller (IEC). Its primary re-sponsibilities include organizing local data and sending it to the communication center via the electro- power connection system. The management of local energy is then done using the return data from the data center. Regional clients can inspect pertinent data by viewing these data center outcomes on the IEC. This data contains how much elec-tricity is bought and sold locally, how much it costs to buy and how much it makes, whether or not other people utilize local energy and other relevant data. SDN is separated into three levels, as seen in Fig. 5. The infrastruc-ture layer is constructed with various networking devices like switches and routers, whose control tasks are administrated by the control layer. The top layer is the application layer, where programmers can easily create various applications as needed. The median layer is the control layer and through a unique agreement, such as OpenFlow, its control plane interfaces to the south to regulate network traffic in the infra-structure layer [39]. 2.1.4. Vehicle to grid (V2G) communication This is an IoE-based V2G communication protocol that consists of two phases.  \u2022 User registration phase: The USP receives the user\u2019s registration request and identification ID over a secure connection. The USP generates a profile and additions a new record to its database as soon as it receives the request. A secret key, a series of shadow identities, and a unique pseudo-identity ID are then generated randomly and utilized in the event that contemporaries within the USP and client are lost. The USP then creates a message and delivers it to the user over the encrypted channel. To communicate with the user in the future, the USP records the message in its database [40].  \u2022 Authentication Phase: The user must go through the authentication procedure to utilize the charging station during this phase. The IoE- based V2G communication ensures protection against impersonation or foreign attack, client security, defense against eve dropping or prevent attacks, etc. [40]. 2.2. Edge based IoE system In contrast to transferring data all the way to remote data centers or cloud servers, edge computing refers to the technique of processing data closer to its source or the \"edge\" of the network. The phrase \"Edge-based Internet of Energy\" refers to the use of edge computing concepts for energy management and the IoE. Edge computing is an addition to or extension of cloud computing that processes data close to the data source, increasing network performance and efficiency overall with less latency. Edge computing reduces the amount of bandwidth needed compared to processing in the cloud by moving computations to the network\u2019s edge. 2.2.1. Micro-moments based energy efficiency solution This infrastructure is implemented using recommender system that gives end users individualized guidance at the right time and a micro- moment analysis that helps identify anomalous energy usage events. In this infrastructure data is gathered by recording ambient conditions, occupant habits, and footprints of electricity consumption. Then, using an ensemble bagging tree (EBT) classifier, it locates aberrant power consumption patterns. Then the recommendation and automation stage is implemented giving end-users individualized advice for endorsing appropriate energy use and gives them the option to monitor equipment. Lastly, statistics and visualization is achieved by enabling the depiction of anomalous consumption data and effectively and engagingly provides end-users with their energy consumption statistics using a mobile app [41,42]. 2.2.2. M2SP-EdgeIoE framework The following elements created by the authors make up the M2SP- EdgeIoE framework: (i) data collection: gathers micro-moment-based data for monitoring environmental conditions and power usage; en-ergy disaggregation (ii) detects each device using its power trace after applying Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) techniques to separate the primary power consumption into appliance-level data; (iii) Anomaly detection: To identify comparable energy behavior and its environment, micro-moment analysis and classification algorithms are used [43]; (iv) recommendation and automation: generates tailored advice to the Fig. 5. SDN network layers.  M. Farhan et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Energy and AI 14 (2023) 1003069end-user to support particular actions to improve energy efficiency along with suggested automation; and (v) visualization: effectively and captivatingly present data, anomalies, and recommendations through a mobile application [44,45]. 2.2.3. Edge based IoE in health care implementation The need for a health care monitoring system is always great due to the aging population growth and rise in chronic diseases. The develop-ment of technology like IoT and cloud has made healthcare more accessible and affordable. Three layers make up the system. The wear-able sensor devices\u2019 first layer, collects and gathers the physiological data, the transmit layer uses the Internet to send the data collected to the application server and the application server handles data analysis, decision-making, and feature extraction [46]. The installed IoT devices in edge computing-based healthcare sys-tems collect and locally evaluate data from patients. Patient\u2019s physio-logical data is collected by wearable IoT devices, which then send it to application servers. Edge computing brings processing and computing power closer to the source of the data. When internet connections are inadequate for accessing centralized databases, this facilitates data ac-cess. As a result, adopting edge computing for the health care system can provide more control and the capacity to use data in close to real-time, which continues to be a promising technique to assist service providers in distributing their network and data in a way that it can be used and shared rapidly and securely [47]. 2.3. Key technologies An ideal IoE system may consist of various primary and secondary components. The basic components are highlighted in this section. 2.3.1. Router Excess energy comes into the grid by energy routers when central supply exceeds local demand. The grid utilizes the E-router to fill in the energy gap when there is a local energy deficit. When a user needs change over time, energy routers are responsible for detecting demand changes and dynamically adapting energy delivery [48]. The E-router may be distinguished into three sorts on the dissimilar types of tech-nological implementations. Fig. 6 depicts an SST-based E-router that converts multiple energy types and voltage volume in the administration network [49]. The MPC router and the SST-based E-router have similar imple-mentation concepts in Fig. 7, but the latter has a distinct structure and is often used in small voltage administration networks of houses and buildings. Fig. 8 shows a PLC-based E-router whose execution differs from the two kinds of energy routers outlined before. It accomplishes time division multiplexing and transfer of power in a residential system, expanding standard PLC technologies [49]. 2.3.2. Energy storage system Electricity demand does not remain steady throughout the year. The rising demand for electricity causes a disproportion between supply and demand, consequently, the electricity supply being shut down or load- shedding. The extra power generated by the RE is stocked in storage systems, which can provide electricity directed toward the load in the event of a grid breakdown or power shortage. Different forms of ESS, such as batteries, flywheels, and supercapacitors are available to in-crease power quality, grid operation, dependability, flexibility, resil-ience, and reduce power imbalance problems [50]. A comparative study of different ESS has been conducted in Table 3. 2.3.3. DER The IoE\u2019s technological infrastructure might include a wide range of Fig. 6. Basic architecture of SST router.  M. Farhan et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Energy and AI 14 (2023) 10030610DER, including RE, ESS, and fuel cells. The performance of RE sources is determined mainly by environmental factors, including wind speed and direction, temperature, and solar irradiation, which vary with time and year and have various effects on IoE generation. To fulfill the voids left by one RE source and provide end users with a constant and predictable power supply, many RE sources with a number of ESS may be deployed concurrently [51]. Different RE sources are highlighted in Table 4. 2.3.4. Plug-and-play interface Plug-and-play (PP) refers to the capacity to produce energy even from small-scale generating resources such that power delivery to the network is as simple as inserting a plug within a socket [11]. The PP feature is supported by an intelligent communication interface, which detects the connectivity position of a random gadget and allows the grid to accommodate different types of ESS and generation systems [52]. The energy production request message is sent to the energy router by the renewable source when it is plugged in and prepared to provide Fig. 7. Basic architecture of MPC router.  Fig. 8. Basic architecture of PLC router.  Table 3 Highlights the different ESS [50].

Farhan et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Energy and AI 14 (2023) 10030611electricity. The local power demand is examined by the energy router, together with the current load demand and power capability of DESD, before the energy router permits entry to the renewable to begin generating electricity [52]. Table 5 compares different technologies used in IoE. 2.3.5. Smart metering Smart Meter (SM) is an important element for SG that helps the user to optimize their energy usage and utility charge as shown in Fig. 9. A communication connection and meter information management make up the smart meter infrastructure (SMI) which facilitates the distribution and collection of data between meters and services as shown in Fig. 10. The SMI contains of intelligent sensors, energy management techniques, smart home meters, and smart appliances. The electrical parameters that the smart meter calculates, such as voltage, current, active, reactive, perceived power, etc., would be communicated to utilities so that they may store the data for later retrieval and study [53]. 2.3.5.1. Smart metering infrastructure. The infrastructure for smart me-ters connects service providers with client-end field sensors. The cus-tomer\u2019s property may include gadgets like an intelligent meter, temperature sensing device thermostat and a display, etc. At the same time, the distributor has applications for charging the customer usage [53]. The SMI technology part consists of the following: \u2022 Communication network: There are three types of SMI communi-cation networks such as (i) Wide Area Networks (WAN) which manage traffic volume and unnecessary delays, (ii) Neighborhood area networks (NAN) to communicate and transmit information from the smart meter to the data collector unit, and (iii) Home Area Networks (HANs) that allows devices inside end-user premises to communicate and cooperate. \u2022 Meter data collection system: The control center technology in-cludes software packages for the meter data collection system. Through a communication network, the data collector unit gathers information from smart meters, further transmitting it to the end system. In the event of data transmission failures or a complete blackout, the operator may connect and detach meters using a data collector unit, and this information will be kept in a database.  \u2022 Meter data management system: A host system known as a meter data management system (MDMS) collects, saves, and asses the calculated data for charging, duration of utilization, day of the week, peak load management, etc. The MDMS provides on-demand meter readings, energy status authentication, and remotely connect/ disconnect of remote meters. The data on utilization and affairs collected from the meter end is included in the imported data and is essential for analysis and demand forecasting. 2.4. IoE protocol IoE protocol can be divided into two sections which can be described below: 2.4.1. Smart network protocol Smart networks may accommodate a wide range of communication protocols. One of the most common usages of smart network protocols is in residential areas, depicted in Fig. 11. IoT networks in the field may Table 4 Highlights of different renewable energy [51].

Illustration of smart meter.  M. Farhan et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Energy and AI 14 (2023) 10030612select a scattering path by creating an information meeting and a connection design through the protocol stack since they are self-aware. The supported routing patterns include proactive, reactive, and hybrid techniques in addition to static, adaptive, flat, and hierarchical patterns. The standard protocols are assessed in two stages [54].  \u2022 Application layer: To address concerns like extensive information, safety, flexibility, observability, expandability, and real-time adap-tion, the creation of IoE infrastructure needs architecture-based work specifications [55]. Since it must support networks with limited re-sources, application layer protocols are created to give dependable and effective transmission.  \u2022 Infrastructure layer Any network\u2019s backbone is its infrastructure, which keeps nodes linked and current for data transfer. Infrastruc-ture layer protocols are in charge of meeting exact specifications, acquiring divergent policies, matching traffic designs, the proper power consumption, etc. 2.4.2. Standards and protocols of EV charging The intelligent charging system connects with the entire system and gives the vehicles the best possible charge. For creating appropriate communication between the entities, a few basic protocols must be followed [56]. \u2022 Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP): A protocol based on appli-cations is necessary to establish the foundation for information transmission within the charging point and the main administration point. Vendor-focused and freely downloadable, this application protocol was created by the Open Charge Alliance. It offers addi-tional flexibility for EV drivers\u2019 information to be easily obtained. The features of OCPP are transaction management, safety, intelligent charging, message presentation, and creation of warnings in case of failure [56]. \u2022 Open Charge Point Interface (OCPI): This interface used to facili-tate data exchange on charging stations between charging station Fig. 10. Smart metering infrastructure.  Fig. 11. IoE and residential consumption management.  M. Farhan et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Energy and AI 14 (2023) 10030613owners as well as the e-mobility service. The following is a list of the OCPI\u2019s characteristics [57]. \u2013 Updates are being made to the session information and the loca-tion status.  \u2013 Using a distance to send orders.  \u2013 Supplying charge information records to offer accurate billing amounts.  \u2013 Using a token exchange to authorize charging stations  \u2022 OADR: It is intended for information sharing inside the system to analyze the OADR. It is standardized for dispatching and collecting reliable data among DER and the energy management structure\u2019s control system to precisely estimate demand during its operation at peak times [56].  \u2022 Global System for Mobile (GSM): It is the world\u2019s most well-known new mobile network. It uses circuit switching as its foundation and runs between 900 and 1800 MHz. Having transmission rate of up to 270 kbps, Gaussian Minimum Shifting Key is a modulation method employed. This protocol\u2019s architecture is divided into the mobile handset and the substations of the base station, networking switch-ing and operation support [58].  \u2022 General Packet Radio Service: It uses the GSM network\u2019s packet- based data transfer technology. This network enables faster data transmission rates for IP-based applications than the GSM [59]. This specific networking protocol is used mainly for SG applications in faraway locations. 3. Challenges in IoE Fig. 12 illustrates the applications of IoE in smart power systems. However, integrating IoT into energy systems has its obstacles and challenges [60] as shown in Fig. 13. Table 6 discussed the highlights of the challenges. They are briefly described below: 3.1. Energy consumption Many internet-connected systems need to run to allow IoT connec-tivity in energy systems. A significant quantity of energy is required to run this system and transport the massive data generated by IoT gadgets. As a result, IoT systems\u2019 energy usage remains a significant concern. Various techniques for reducing the power consumption of IoT systems have been attempted. Set the sensors to sleep mode while not in use, for example. Radio optimization methods, including cooperative commu-nication and modulation optimization, have been suggested as a solu-tion for this challenge [61]. 3.2. IoT integration with subsystems One of the significant challenges is merging an IoT system into the Fig. 12. IoE in smart power system.  Fig. 13. Challenges of IoE.  M. Farhan et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Energy and AI 14 (2023) 10030614energy system. Energy industry subsystems employ a range of sensor and data transmission technologies because they are unique. To manage data interchange across the subsystems, solutions are needed [62]. The integration difficulty may be overcome while considering the IoT needs of a subsystem by designing an integrative framework for the power system [62]. Another method for system integration and reducing syn-chronization lag issues across subsystems for energy systems is to create co-simulation models [63]. 3.3. Complexity Analyzing, evaluating, and constructing a proper communication infrastructure will be challenging. It focuses on individualized energy consumption in the house also the usage of green distributed energy. It will be crucial to coordinate the regulation of all controllable loads due to the Internet\u2019s significant share of renewable energy. Therefore, to improve this capacity, it is necessary to enhance the digital signal pro-cessing feature. Power electronic equipment\u2019s system model should use a range of non-traditional control methods, including fuzzy control, predictive control and neural network control as well as sophisticated control technology algorithms, to increase it dependability and adapt-ability [25,56]. 3.4. User privacy The term \"privacy\" describes a person\u2019s or a group\u2019s expectation of confidentiality while disclosing personal information to a third party, such as an energy provider. It is thus difficult to get accurate information on the number of energy consumers and the quantity and variety of equipment that utilize energy. Smart home appliances and smart meters may provide more insight into energy systems than just energy use. Information about a consumer\u2019s location, including whether or not they are at home, and habits like sleeping and waking hours, may compro-mise their privacy [60,64]. The idea of a brand-new dummy location privacy-preserving (DLP) algorithm has been proposed. This algorithm evaluates various privacy needs of various users as well as computing costs to effectively maintain users\u2019 position secrecy [65,66]. 3.5. Efficiency Relying on the network structure, supervision principles, and system, IoE has varying scalability, resilience, and other qualities [25]. A world powered by the IoT suggests that a sensor should be used to gather in-formation about each unique item and that each sensor\u2019s power source should be identified. To keep thousands of these detecting junctions operating, a huge amount of power would be required where the maintenance of efficiency is essential. A new framework for IoT systems has been created to solve this issue, reducing the need for human contact in architecture and conserving energy. For this, a self-organized thing is devised to maximize energy efficiency [67]. 3.6. Standard IoE includes various technologies and applications communicating in real-time while complying with multiple standards. The inconsistency between IoT gadgets that adhere to different standards creates new difficulty [68]. It includes standards for processing unstructured data, privacy concerns, and regulatory standards for data marketplaces [69]. One method to overcome the difficulty of standardization in IoT-based power systems is to design a process with a shared idea that all partic-ipants can use and access evenly. A further option is for the parties to develop open data structures and protocols for the standards. Standards will thus be accessible to everyone and supplied without charge [70,77]. 3.7. Global architecture for IoE IoT projects enable transmissions for associated services at any time, place, or self-contained manner. This indicates that they were created with complex, decentralized, and mobile characteristics based on their application needs. As a result, designing architecture presents an addi-tional challenge for IoT-enabled energy systems. A reference design cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution for all IoT applications, given their distinct characteristics and requirements. As a result, heterogeneous reference architectures that are open and adhere to standards are required for IoT systems. Users should not be restricted to using fixed Table 6 Highlights of challenges in IoE.  Serial No. Sectors Issues Solutions References 1.

Farhan et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Energy and AI 14 (2023) 10030615and end-to-end IoT connections due to the architectures [71]. System structures are created depending on the usage of the system [72]. 3.8. Business model Traditional grid economic models rely on huge centralized producers and utility firms that control a significant part of the market from gen-eration to customer premises that readily handle a high fraction of distributed renewable generating or power storage for technology and market reasons. New business ideas are necessary to create a more marketplace and enable peer-to-peer driven energy transfers. A signifi-cant barrier to developing a future service- oriented electrical market is the deregulation and transformation of the current energy market [73]. 3.9. Data tempering An intruder can change conveyed data, such as previous variable pricing data, by changing peak time energy usage prices into the cheapest rates, overloading the power network and raising residential energy usage. The security affects the information dependability of the system in the case of distributed state estimation. Additional smart de-vices may be present there. Each device\u2019s transacted information must be secure, as erroneous data injection could result in cascading failures and possibly a widespread blackout. To avoid erroneous injection, a mitigation strategy based on the cooperation of views and an assault detection technique based on adaptive features were developed [74,75]. 3.10. Cyber attack Cyber-attack (CA) on power systems are increasingly a widespread concern that has spawned a new study topic. CA mentions unauthorised entry to the system with the intent of causing harm or stealing data [54]. ICT not only makes intelligent gadgets more user-friendly, but it also causes specific security issues by encouraging cyber crime [76]. The cyber-physical system integrates the cloud network with the physical component so that users may control or access their gadgets from any-where in the globe via the network connection. However, it has evolved into a cyber-physical assault whose primary goal is to gain entrance to any smart architecture and infuse fake information to alter the system\u2019s behavior and cause harm. CA on SG or an IoE system may create inac-curate data regarding power use, utility charges, and other parameters, which has a technological and financial impact on end users and service providers by wasting energy and raising utility charges [78]. Any misalignment in the electricity system\u2019s frequency pattern might harm grid equipment as well as client appliances [54]. 3.11. Middleware MW is a software framework that permits communication between application units while being application- independent. MW refers to a gateway that serves as a connection point between the various IoE components. Since industrial networks are subject to computational and resource limits, low MW adds complexity and expense. Industrial net-works have a lengthy lifespan, therefore challenges with heterogeneity include semantic disputes, global heterogeneity, new/unknown gadgets and numerous devices communicating. These areas include data man-agement, resource discovery, and event management, all of which are connected to functional needs [54,55]. 3.12. Data integrity (DI) Data accuracy concerning modification, tempering, and change is data integrity. DI problems can be generated purposefully by an attacker or unreliable hardware, software, or networks. DA attacks seek to add or modify information to deceive the affected network into making wrong choices. Additionally, statistical analysis is used to spot inaccurate capacity, although associated faults make it simple to go around it [54, 79]. From time to time, various techniques have been involved in maintaining the data integrity of any specific IoE system. 3.12.1. Blockchain based 3.12.1.1. Edge cloud-based EBIQS model. This model is based on supply chain logistics (SCL), having three layers for this architecture: IoE device perception, Edge blockchain and cloud blockchain. Fig. 14 shows a detailed basic EBIQS model. In the first layer, logistical assets, including personnel, goods, pallets, and trucks involved in SCL activities, are given IoE devices so they may be recognized, felt, communicated with, controlled over, and monitored. The connection module, sensors, and batteries of an active Bluetooth tag enable the entire data origin process from data production (sensing) through data transfer. The cloud-based solutions concentrate different computer resources to tackle issues, and the enormous IoE data they create are geographically spread [80]. 3.12.1.2. An AI-based blockchain model. This blockchain-based access control system has a network architecture that can identify and coun-teract harmful IoE attacks. Data is safely gathered from various IoT smart devices installed in various IoE applications and then kept in a Fig. 14. EBIQS model.  M. Farhan et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Energy and AI 14 (2023) 10030616blockchain or other data repository. The related cloud server (CS) re-ceives secure blocks from the fog server (FS) created using the produced transactions. The blocks are sent to the CS using the associated cloud server\u2019s public key. The mined block is then added to the blockchain by CS using a well-known consensus mechanism (for example, PBFT and RSPCA) [81]. 3.12.2. Multilayer long short-term memory network-based model (MLSTM) The straightforward and effective model architecture trains all data- driven models during the attack detection stage. As a result, the model has demonstrated its practical applications and now operates in real- time. MLSTM uses two layers and obtains the most remarkable results across all criteria. Perhaps because of the complexity of the data struc-ture, the support vector machine cannot perform well. While the K- Nearest neighbor algorithm put up reasonable efforts, it falls short of the convolutional neural network and MLSTM. The artificial neural network does not perform optimally because of the short model depth, although the convolutional neural network only uses two layers to obtain outstanding results. Even with a window size of 50 (0.05 s), MLSTM outperforms the convolutional neural network with a more significant analysis window length, MLSTM achieves a better result [82,83]. 4. Applications of IoE IoT technology can used in a variety of applications throughout the energy sector. However, for IoT implementation in the energy industry, a few cutting-edge trends and applications are needed. The applications of IoE are discussed below: 4.1. Energy efficiency The Internet of Energy (IoE) has indeed revolutionized energy effi-ciency, making it one of its primary applications. Beyond the imperative of utilizing green and renewable energy sources, it is crucial to minimize energy wastage and formulate strategies for optimizing this valuable resource. Informing end-users about their energy consumption foot-prints and offering guidance on behavior modification constitutes a significant step toward achieving this goal [84]. In recent years, global energy consumption has surged dramatically, with the building sector alone accounting for over 40 % of the world\u2019s energy usage. The Internet of Things (IoT) is poised to connect everything, including household appliances, mobile devices, sensors, etc., facilitating data exchange and significantly impacting energy efficiency systems. IoT plays a pivotal role in various energy-efficiency ecosystems through remote data collection and control [85]. The initial phases of a robust energy-efficient framework involve collecting and recording data related to indoor and outdoor conditions, energy consumption, end-user behaviors, and preferences. This data empowers energy efficiency sys-tems to leverage IoT technology effectively. Furthermore, IoE enables precise management and optimization of energy consumption by inte-grating cutting-edge technologies like demand response systems, smart grids, and real-time energy monitoring. This supports load shifting, peak demand reduction, and the efficient utilization of distributed energy resources, empowering consumers and companies to make informed decisions regarding their energy con-sumption patterns [86]. With the increasing use of smart meters, IoT sensors, and machine learning technologies, energy-saving recommen-dation systems are demonstrating their potential as a viable means to promote sustainability and reduce carbon emissions. Their development coincides with the evolution of sophisticated Internet systems [87]. Detecting anomalies in energy consumption represents a critical initial step in the development of effective energy-saving technologies, which can ultimately lower total energy costs and reduce carbon emissions. Consequently, it is imperative to devise effective strategies for identi-fying unusual usage in buildings and providing end-users and adminis-trators access to this information. IoE identifies inefficiencies and streamlines processes, reducing energy waste and transmission losses while fostering a more sustainable energy environment. It achieves this through predictive maintenance, data analytics, and automation [88]. 4.2. Anomaly detection Energy efficiency is widely recognized as a cost-effective solution to address various energy-related concerns, including economic and social repercussions stemming from high energy costs, energy security, global warming, and climate change [89]. Presently, a significant challenge in the quest for reduced power consumption lies in understanding, diag-nosing, and visualizing abnormal energy usage patterns within house-holds. An imperative application within the realm of the Internet of Energy (IoE), anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in enhancing sys-tem stability and energy efficiency [90]. IoE possesses the capability to detect anomalies and deviations within energy consumption, produc-tion, and distribution patterns by amalgamating real-time data streams with advanced analytics. This system promptly identifies irregularities, such as equipment malfunctions, grid instability, or unauthorised ac-cess, by establishing baseline behaviors and employing machine learning techniques. Anomaly detection, also known as fault detection and diagnosis (FDD), entails identifying occurrences or observations that deviate from expected patterns or behaviors, often offering insights into the health of the system under investigation [91]. These anomalies can take various forms, including outliers with values significantly different from nearby energy consumption data, potentially attributed to equipment malfunctions, transient disturbances during equipment activation, or momentary sensor data interference [92]. Another form of anomaly is contextual, where unusual energy consumption trends emerge over a specific timeframe, which may be acceptable at an individual level but signify a broader issue [93]. Ac-curate anomaly detection supports energy-saving initiatives, timely equipment maintenance, and adaptive operational strategies, prevent-ing unnecessary resource losses and substantially enhancing overall energy efficiency. Identifying anomalies and their sources is pivotal in achieving resource loss reduction [94]. Anomaly detection not only curtails excessive energy consumption but also prevents minor issues from escalating into major ones. Through proactive interventions and early identification, potential disruptions can be mitigated, further elevating energy efficiency. By minimizing energy losses and downtime, IoE\u2019s anomaly detection not only safeguards the integrity of energy infrastructure but also optimizes efficiency, ultimately culminating in a more resilient and efficient energy ecosystem [95]. To facilitate efficient energy use, it is imperative to document anomalous consumption pat-terns. Hence, implementing energy monitoring systems and bench-marking procedures can reduce abnormal behaviors and footprints [96]. The development of sophisticated anomaly detection systems tailored for energy consumption holds promise in unveiling novel forms of anomalous patterns, further enhancing energy efficiency and conser-vation efforts [97]. 4.3. Behavioral change The Internet of Energy (IoE) holds significant potential for driving behavioral change in how individuals and businesses manage their en-ergy resources. By providing real-time data on energy production, consumption, and pricing, IoE empowers consumers to take more con-trol over their daily energy usage. Armed with this knowledge, cus-tomers can make wiser energy choices, resulting in behavioral shifts that prioritize sustainability and efficiency. Recommendation systems play a crucial role in this transformation by continuously assessing user con-texts and activities against a set of rules, taking user goals and prefer-ences into account, and prioritizing recommended actions. It\u2019s essential for these recommendation systems to be transparent to build user trust and encourage the adoption of their suggestions [45]. For instance, REHAB-C is a recommendation engine designed to assist customers in M. Farhan et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Energy and AI 14 (2023) 10030617developing more energy-efficient behaviors and altering their current energy usage patterns. These recommendation systems aim to examine user profiles, process available options, consider other users\u2019 profiles and contextual conditions, and then offer the most suitable alternatives. IoE also promotes energy-saving behaviors, such as load shifting to off-peak hours and prudent use of energy-intensive equipment, through user-friendly interfaces and mobile apps. These practices help reduce energy costs and alleviate stress on the grid during peak demand, ulti-mately enhancing overall grid resilience. IoE\u2019s integration of various technologies for data gathering, interpretation, and behavioral change is reshaping the building energy sector [98]. The concept of \"micro-mo-ments\" encapsulates users\u2019 interactions with building appliances, high-lighting the profound impact of collecting and analyzing big data on energy utilization across sectors and research areas. Furthermore, IoE\u2019s ability to collect and analyze consumption data empowers users to set energy-saving goals and track their progress, fostering positive behav-ioral changes that contribute to a more energy-conscious and environ-mentally responsible society [99,100]. 4.4. Energy disaggregation (Non-intrusive load monitoring) The Internet of Energy (IoE) critically depends on the implementa-tion of energy disaggregation, sometimes referred to as Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM). Non-intrusive load monitoring is a crucial, cost-effective technique for keeping track of power usage and addressing a number of issues that arise while moving to a competitive, efficient, and sustainable energy environment [88]. It is the technique of deter-mining individual device usage footprints within a building from the total power consumption recorded at the main power entrance without the installation of individual smart meters for each appliance. NILM is designed to deduce the device-wise consumption from an aggregated consumption that is obtained from the primary supply [101]. An effec-tive classifier and feature extraction module must be used in conjunction to create an effective NILM system. The feature extraction module must be able to capture the unique consumption fingerprint of each electrical equipment. It transforms energy management by offering a non- intru-sive way to identify the individual energy use of different equipment in a domestic or business context [102]. The Internet of Things (IoE) uses cutting-edge analytics and machine learning techniques to assess the entire energy consumption data from a single point of measurement, such as a smart meter, and then disag-gregate it into specific insights about which appliances are consuming energy and when. This degree of detail enables customers to fully comprehend their energy consumption trends, spot inefficiencies, and make well-informed decisions to optimize energy use. NILM is a potent substitute for creating a robust, accurate, and scalable load monitoring system for the home market that is simple to set up and doesn\u2019t cost more. Additionally, the benefits of NILM are not just restricted to end users; they may also improve operational effectiveness, assist providers in reducing operating costs, and enhance public health and well-being [103]. By providing end users with real-time consumption footprints, modifying their energy use behaviors, and further detecting problematic equipment, NILM systems play a crucial role in aiding end users in reducing their energy consumption. Energy disaggregation not only improves energy efficiency but also makes load forecasting, predictive maintenance, and demand response possible. By enabling effective appliance management and knowledgeable energy-saving techniques, this process helps to create a more sustainable and responsive energy ecosystem [85]. 4.5. Energy visualization Energy visualization is a key application in the Internet of Energy (IoE) environment, providing a compelling way to improve energy ef-ficiency and user involvement. The rapid economic growth and improved living standards have led to increased household energy consumption, underscoring the pressing need for energy conservation to protect the environment and address climate change. The development of an Internet of Things (IoT) system that tracks customers\u2019 energy usage patterns and promptly provides energy-saving recommendations can influence user behaviors positively [104]. IoE facilitates the real-time display of energy consumption trends, production, and distribution through data analytics and user-friendly interfaces, empowering in-dividuals and organizations to gain deeper insights into their energy consumption for more informed decision-making. Users can monitor and manage their energy use in real time using energy dashboards, interactive applications, and graphical representations [105]. IoE, following the footsteps of smart grids, has become a prominent technology in the energy industry. It harnesses the internet to build a distributed smart energy infrastructure, aggregating, organizing, opti-mizing, and controlling energy data from various edge devices. This data is used for demand and supply forecasting and fine-tuning energy usage habits through sensor and communication technology. Beyond increasing awareness of energy consumption, this transparency en-courages behavioral changes that reduce consumption during peak pe-riods, optimize load distribution, and enhance overall efficiency [106]. Data visualization tools can gradually modify people\u2019s behaviors by incrementally reducing their energy consumption, with the most effec-tive tools featuring well-designed visualizations accompanied by sound advice. Furthermore, energy visualization fosters the adoption of renewable energy sources, as users can witness the direct impact of their choices on the environment and energy costs, ultimately contributing to a more resilient and sustainable energy ecosystem [107]. 4.6. Security and privacy issues In the context of Internet of Energy (IoE) applications, security and privacy concerns are crucial. IoE exposes a number of vulnerabilities that need to be fixed as it uses linked devices and data streams to enhance energy management. There are issues with data privacy and potential breaches due to the enormous volume of data created, including real- time energy usage trends and user activity. The IoE has significant issues as a result of security assaults on resources, data, networks, users, and applications. Major security issues include these security assaults as well as additional difficulties like risk management and network assurance. An unreliable or compromised IoT platform provider will invariably cause security and privacy concerns [108]. Unauthorised access to this data might jeopardize individual privacy while also allowing bad actors to learn more about occupant prefer-ences, perhaps creating a security concern. The inclusion of smart grids and energy systems into IoE further increases the danger of cyberattacks directed at crucial infrastructure. These systems are vulnerable to breaches that might cause power outages, financial losses, and even safety risks. The integrated internet-based smart grid and energy re-sources inherit all the security flaws of the current smart grid. The smart grid\u2019s security framework is no longer sufficient to fulfill the security requirements of the energy sectors. IoE is envisioned as an integrated platform with power flow and multidirectional communication methods for enhancing the smart grid. Real-time data collection and analysis are done using IoT technology for smart energy management. To protect the integrity of IoE systems, it is essential to implement strong cybersecurity measures, such as encryption, authentication, and intrusion detection [109]. Striking the correct balance between data sharing for efficiency and safeguarding user privacy remains a big problem, demanding strict data protection laws and user permission methods to guarantee that people have control over their data. Applications based on blockchain that prioritize privacy in the IoT ecosystem and energy trading have gener-ated a lot of attention. Blockchain users are vulnerable to privacy threats due to the distributed nature of the technology and the shared ledger\u2019s availability of transactional data. Blockchain\u2019s trustworthy end-to-end capabilities enable us to add accountability and dependability M. Farhan et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Energy and AI 14 (2023) 10030618characteristics to IoT transactions [110]. Recommender systems (RSs) have grown in popularity as a result of the growing usage of the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile phones, linked devices, and artificial intelligence (AI), in part due to their capacity to evaluate large amounts of data and influence user behavior. Recommender systems are often utilized in a variety of application fields, such as social networking, e-commerce, healthcare, and energy conservation [111]. The analysis and mining of enormous volumes of user data, including demographics, preferences, social activities, etc., is necessary for these applications. Vehicle to Grid (V2G) technology, in its broadest sense, refers to technologies that make it possible for electrical energy to flow back and forth between auto-mobiles and the electrical grid. When the grid needs electricity, elec-trical energy can travel from the grid to the vehicle to charge the battery or it can go in the other manner [40]. Analyzing security risk and energy use is still difficult. The low-power sensor nodes may slow down the delivery of data to distant data centers due to imbalanced energy con-sumption. In conclusion, even though IoE has enormous potential for improving energy efficiency, resolving its security and privacy issues is essential to fostering confidence, defending user data, and preserving the dependability of energy infrastructure [112]. 5. Road towards next generation IoE There are several benefits to using current IoT technologies to pro-vide energy-effective solutions. However, innovative ideas and trends are required for IoT deployment in the energy sector. Some over-the-top ideas may be to enhance security and privacy by creating sophisticated encryption and authentication techniques to safeguard IoE devices and data, to create standards and protocols to provide seamless communi-cation between various IoE systems and devices, to study how edge and fog computing can be more fully included in IoE to improve real-time processing, lower latency, and maximize resource consumption, to examine how encryption, optimization, and data processing may be affected by quantum computing in the Internet of Energy [93,107]. Fig. 15 shows a road map towards the next generation IoE system. The future of IoE is discussed below: 5.1. Next generation vehicle The growing number of EVs on the road annually indicates that more people are interested in using them as alternatives to current vehicles, including cars, motorcycles, and other vehicles. Because EVs may serve as both a power supply and a burden on the grid, it is feasible to determine the condition [113]. Besides, autonomous vehicles (AV) are self-driving vehicles that are neither controlled nor influenced by humans. These self-driving vehicles use embedded sensor technology to minimize collisions, energy use, contamination, road congestion, and public contact. Sensors, radars, and cameras aid autonomous cars in continually detecting vehicle locations, roadways, barriers, dangers, and traffic. These vehicles are environmentally friendly and can identify traffic jams, obstructions, and the optimal path to get to a location in the lowest amount of time [54]. It can be used to deliver power to the grid during peak demand. As a result, one of the most widely adopted con-cepts at the moment is the incorporation of an EV power system into the IoT [113]. Additionally, the IoE idea is critical for demand flexibility. Because of the rising demand for and widespread use of electric cars, the flexible energy revolution should be promoted and executed (EV) [114]. According to Navigant Research, light-duty EVs will reach to 6400 thousand in 2023. The connection between EVs and the power grid not only promotes the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) but also increases the grid-to-vehicle (G2V) usage [115]. 5.2. Next generation energy resources The IoE is made up of several renewable power sources that are wired into the grid to provide clean energy. The cost of these renewable energy sources is declining due to technological improvement, which contributes to the yearly expansion of the global economy. The wind power system harnesses the wind\u2019s energy and converts it into elec-tricity. The ideal fossil-fuel-free option is a RE that is responsible for clean and environmentally friendly energy generation. RE sources like wind or tidal turbines, PV systems, bio-gas and mass with modified technologies and materials can be properly utilized to take an important role in the energy production sector [113]. 5.3. Next generation batteries The batteries help the grid be more effective by supplying high-grade electricity, ensuring consistent supply, and maintaining grid stability. When the grid is overloaded and unable to balance supply and demand during peak periods, batteries or energy storage are pretty valuable. The advancement of new technological batteries such as NanoBolt lithium tungsten, Zinc-manganese oxide, Gold nanowire gel electrolyte, and Organosilicon electrolyte can play a vital role in the energy sector. Customers may recharge their electric vehicles\u2019 batteries which can be supplied to the grid during peak hours to maximize their economic gain [113]. 5.4. Cyberattack avoidance On an industrial, IoE systems are designed to run continuously, to minimize excessive downtime or stoppage during peak hours which Fig. 15. Roadmap to next generation IoE.  M. Farhan et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Energy and AI 14 (2023) 10030619requires continuous monitoring of audit, accountability, or service availability to overcome any vulnerable assault. The creation of big data can enhance security walls. Furthermore, packet storming, server/client credentials, security layout, integrity verification, and authentication stages are some of the methods presented to protect TPS-based systems [116]. On the other hand, a watchful system requires open-minded measures, including secrecy, verification, serviceability, account-ability, and audit [54]. 5.5. Block chain The majority of today\u2019s IoT solutions depend on a centralized cloud platform [117]. A lot of IoT devices must be connected in most IoT applications, which is difficult to synchronize. Furthermore, because of the centralized structure of IoT, when the server is attacked, all con-nected items are easily hacked and compromised, resulting in system security risks, and privacy concerns for users [118]. Although a block-chain is not an information defense system, its unique qualities can give information data with more anti-interference and secrecy. The energy internet information system technology may be built on block technol-ogy. After the packet, each perceptual device is encrypted with different private keys. The data route has significant redundancy since the in-formation node chain of the entire system creates a mesh topology [119]. Blockchain is a decentralized and regularizing system. Every IoT node must verify to the blockchain consensus platform that it is pursuing the same aim as the others. The storing of verified transactions plays a vital role in not to lost information. As a result, each member of the blockchain is instantaneously informed of any changes in each block [120]. Blockchain consensus techniques which can create a safely distributed database [118,121]. More significantly, blockchain allows things to store and exchange software upgrades. The modification of the block is very critical when the blockchain is updated. As a result, blockchain can provide IoT-based solutions with updated availability, and innocuousness [122]. The deployment of blockchain in the energy industry can accelerate IoT effectiveness, boosting energy security and efficiency. People can easily exchange energy with one another. Another benefit is that by monitoring a region\u2019s use data [123]. 6. Conclusion Numerous advancements are being made in the administration, distribution, and transmission of electricity thanks to modern civiliza-tion. More effective techniques and advanced computer technologies are being utilized to forecast varied expenditures and converted the power system into a smarter one with the proper integration of ICT. IoE is a relatively new and attractive architecture for delivering energy that is quite versatile, long-lasting, pragmatic, and efficient. This research work analyzed the evolution of the power system that aids researchers by directing a route showing the growing flow of the IoE to cut utility costs and power consumption by adequately scheduling the loads. The modeling criteria and difficulties of the IoE infrastructure, energy con-sumption management, communication architecture, supply and de-mand ratio as well as security requirements have been investigated that will help the researchers to find the lacking and to understand the importance of upgrading of the existing power systems. The investiga-tion of design and control challenges of the IoE in case of integration, cyber-security, energy management and pricing scheme has been car-ried out with their control solution to increase system resiliency and stability. The necessity and importance of the upgradation of the IoE to the next generation IoE system has been analyzed in this paper by constructing a directional framework, technological improvement and future recommendations.

It combined Science and Technology Studies with a transdisciplinary policy lab toolbox filled with frameworks from Foresight and Horizon Scanning, Behavioural Insights, or Participatory, Critical and Speculative Design. Amid unfolding and uncertain developments of the Blockchain space, our research signals a number of crucial opportunities and challenges around a technology that could record, secure and transfer any digitised transaction or process, and thus potentially affect large parts of current industrial landscapes. This report offers key insights for its implementation and uptake by industry, businesses and SMEs, together with science for policy strategic recommendations.JRC.I.2-Foresight, Behavioural Insights and Design for Polic",

support to this project, especially considering their openness to \nembrace innovative ways of building evidence based policy advice with forward looking, stakeholder-centric, \nand experimental frameworks.  \n \nWe wish to thank in particular Slawomir Tokarski as Director of Innovation and Advanced Manufacturing, \nMark Niklas as Head of Unit of Innovation for Policy and Growth, and Piotr Swistun as the Policy Officer in \ncharge of this particular collaboration with the JRC, and who was always attentive and supportive. A special \nthank you note also to Xavier Le Mounier, now in DG DEVCO, but who initiated this project with us, and to \nother DG GROW colleagues such as Joachim Schwerin, Rodolphe Wouters and Paolo Casini. \n \nWe thank both our Acting Director and Head of Unit, Xavier Troussard, and our Deputy Head of Unit, Fabiana \nScapolo. They believed in this project from the beginning and allowed it to push the limits of what a Policy \nLab should be able to deliver in terms of innovation in science for policy, namely in supporting the notion that \ntransdisciplinary experimentation is not incompatible with robust scientific research by any means.  \n \nWe also wish to thank many colleagues at the EU Policy Lab whose support and ideas greatly strengthened \nthe project, in particular Sara Giovannini, Ioana Profir, Paulette Matkovic-Ramirez, Jennifer Rudkin, Alessandro \nRancati, Laurent Bontoux, Elisabeta Florescu, Sara Rafael Almeida, Francesca Pissarelo, Maciej \nKrzysztofowicz, Tine Van Criekinge, Alice Szczepanikova, Monika Antal, Marija Suli\u0107, Lola Carmona Zafra and \nFran\u00e7ois Gijsen. We are equally grateful for several exchanges with colleagues as Igor Nai Fovino, from the \nCyber and Digital Citizens Security Unit, and Elena Andonova, from the Intellectual Property and Technology \nTransfer Unit. Moreover, this project would have been impossible without the valuable help of other JRC \ncolleagues such as Lorena Marcaletti, Tina Roque Martins, Martin Parrado, Gregory Minchella and Manuel \nMartins Alves. \n \nThe project benefited widely from informal dialogues with colleagues from many other Directorates-General \nof the European Commission, including DG FISMA, DG CNECT, DG DIGIT, DG RTD, DG TAXUD, DG JUST, DG EAC \nor DG ENER, who joined us for a few rounds of informal meeting around Blockchain and other DLTs. Given the \nimpossibility of referencing everyone we wish to acknowledge these exchanges in the persons of Harald \nStieber, Fabrizio Sestini, and Fidel Santiago. \n \nFinally, we also would like to acknowledge several fruitful dialogues with European Parliament colleagues, in \nparticular considering the Scientific Foresight Unit (STOA) of the Parliamentary Research Service (EPRS), \nwhom we wish to thank in the person of Philip Boucher. \n \nNotwithstanding the many contributors to the project #Blockchain4EU: Blockchain for Industrial \nTransformations, all final responsibility remains solely with the authors. \n  \n5 \n \n \nExecutive Summary \n \nBlockchain and other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) are immutable, encrypted and timestamped \ndatabases in which data is recorded, validated and replicated across a decentralised network of nodes. In an \nincreasingly interconnected world a vast array of opportunities could emerge through the deployment of such \ntechnologies that could enable parties who are geographically distant, or have no particular trust in each \nother, to record, verify and share digital or digitised assets on a peer-to-peer basis with fewer to no \nintermediaries. \n \n#Blockchain4EU: Blockchain for Industrial Transformations is a forward looking exploration of existing, \nemerging and potential applications based on Blockchain and other DLTs for industrial / non-financial sectors. \nThis is a research project coordinated within the European Commission by the EU Policy Lab / Foresight, \nBehavioural Insights and Design for Policy Unit (I.2) of the Joint Research Centre (DG JRC), on request of the \nInnovation Policy and Investment for Growth Unit (F.1) of the Directorate-General for Internal Market, \nIndustry, Entrepreneurship & SMEs (DG GROW). \n \nThe project combined Science and Technology Studies with a transdisciplinary policy lab toolbox filled with \ninsights from Foresight and Horizon Scanning, Behavioural Insights, or Participatory, Critical and Speculative \nDesign. We developed an innovative experimental approach that allowed first to select and refine the sectors, \ntopics and dimensions to be explored, and second to generate ideas on how Blockchain and other DLTs could \nexist in the near future and ultimately test new narratives and plausible scenarios around it. This entailed a \nmix of desk and qualitative research with a series of interviews, surveys, and ethnographic explorations, \ntogether with co-creation workshops. These workshops resulted in the collaborative envisioning, design and \ncreation of five prototypes aimed at physically showcasing how Blockchain could be applied in five specific \nsectors: energy, transports and logistics, creative industries, advanced manufacturing and health. \n \nAmid unfolding and uncertain developments of the Blockchain space, our research signals a number of crucial \nopportunities and challenges around a technology that could record, secure and transfer any digitised \ntransaction or process, and thus potentially affect large parts of current industrial landscapes. Key insights \nfor its implementation and uptake by industry, businesses and SMEs are here summarised: \n \n\uf0b7 Blockchain is still an early-stage and experimental technology. One of the crucial choices concerns \nthe permissionless (public), permissioned (private) and hybrid continuum, and related disputes over \nscalability, energy consumption, security, privacy and protection of personal and sensitive data. \n\uf0b7 Whatever the technical solutions to be developed in upcoming years, interoperable protocols should \nbe promoted so that different Blockchain products and services don\u2019t end up closed, unable to \ncommunicate with each other. Yet, it is crucial to improve current multi-stakeholder governance \nprocesses for the development of open standards. \n\uf0b7 Blockchain systems in many cases will be complementary or integrated with legacy IT systems. \nAnother trend concerns the possible intersection of Blockchain with other key digital technologies in \nthe industrial context, such as IoT, artificial intelligence, robotics, or additive manufacturing. \n\uf0b7 Blockchain may enable efficiency gains and lowering of costs, and introduce new ways of extracting \nand delivering value in business and industry. They may also introduce new decentralised, \ncollaborative, or peer-to-peer economic models, and even usher in \u2018token\u2019 or \u2018crypto\u2019 economies. \n\uf0b7 Potential scenarios of Blockchain as a 'trust machine' don't mean the total dissipation of \nintermediaries and / or absence of governance. Instead the discussion should focus on the concrete \nconditions for decentralised, horizontal and open forms of coordination between individuals, groups \nand companies, which may require a rethinking of traditional, vertical and hierarchical models. \n6 \n \n \n\uf0b7 Who processes, stores and owns data, how and for what purposes, are crucial questions. Close \nattention should be paid for instance to the quality of the data being entered, processed and stored \non a blockchain, or possible incompatibilities of decentralised and cryptographic protocols in regard \nto privacy and personal data. Yet, Blockchain could offer alternative mechanisms to implement data \nprotection by design or privacy by design, and / or data portability. \n\uf0b7 Organisations shouldn\u2019t develop Blockchain solutions looking for problems, but instead find existing \nor foreseeable problems in their business and then look for possible Blockchain solutions. An in-\ndepth analysis of opportunities and risks based on each company's business and regulatory context \nshould be followed by an assessment of Blockchain technical feasibility, and ideally come up with a \nuse case or prototype under an exploratory mode. \n \nNine science for policy strategic recommendations stem from #Blockchain4EU: \n \n\uf0b7 Supporting Experimentation and Piloting with Simplified Requirements. The Blockchain \nspace requires multiplication of high-risk prototypes, Proofs-of-Concepts (PoCs) and pilots in diverse \nareas and/or sectors. This needs simplified grant or procurement procedures, coupled with real-time \nmonitoring and evaluation. \n\uf0b7 Building Upon Other Digitisation Initiatives and Programmes. It is crucial to avoid duplications \nor overlaps while supporting the potential integration of Blockchain with other key industrial \ntechnologies. Existing or new innovation spaces, hubs or centres could be used to run Blockchain \nexperimentation. \n\uf0b7 Stimulating Knowledge Sharing and Collaborations Between Projects. Priority should be \ngiven to free and open source models for developing research, platforms and protocols. Incentivizing \nsharing of results and exchange of best practices will be essential to scale up projects and maximize \ntheir impact across sectors. \n\uf0b7 Fostering Interoperability and Open Standards With Wider Engagement. Open standards \nshould continue to be fostered following a multi-stakeholder, collaborative and consensus driven \nprocess. Dangers of platform or vendor lock-ins should be minimised by inclusive processes to \nfacilitate participation of smaller or newer players.  \n\uf0b7 Promoting Adequate Skills and Training Also Beyond Core Blockchain Spaces. Incentives to \nrecruitment and/or development of programs should create Blockchain expertise across a diversity \nof areas. Actions for upskilling or digital skills training with special attention to SMEs should be \nfurther pursued. \n\uf0b7 Cultivating Wider Exchanges Between Policy and Blockchain Stakeholders. Policymakers \nshould engage directly with Blockchain companies to understand the opportunities and challenges \nahead. This could be facilitated in environments such as innovation hubs and regulatory sandboxes. \n\uf0b7 Funding Blockchain Interdisciplinary and Problem-Driven Research. Funding should be \ngeared not just to technological research, but also to policy, economic, social, legal and \nenvironmental analysis. Start with specific challenges to be addressed and not with internal issues \nof the technology itself. \n\uf0b7 Designing Stable Regulatory Frameworks for Better Policy Preparedness. Regulatory \ncertainty around key issues is needed to unlock opportunities for experimentation. Concerns about \nover-regulation shouldn\u2019t translate into missed opportunities to shape and guide Blockchain \ndevelopment. \n\uf0b7 Championing Blockchain in Public and Governmental Sectors. Blockchain could be explored by \npublic sector organisations to tackle specific challenges in their own activities. It could not only \nincrease demand but also legitimize and stimulate experimentation across private and commercially \ndriven worlds.  \n7 \n \n \n1. #Blockchain4EU: A Forward Looking Exercise \n \n1.1. Setting the Scene \n \nTechnologies are not neutral. Even within the best \nscenarios where they are deeply connected with \nmaterial and conceptual aspects of transparency, \nopenness, adaptability, accessibility, reusability,  \ninteroperability, and so forth, they are still bound, \ninfluenced, and frequently attached to the policy, \neconomic, social, technical, legal or environmental \ndimensions of the contexts in which they are \ncreated, designed, produced, distributed, used and \neven disposed of.  This shouldn\u2019t mean in any way \nthat specific regulatory or funding processes, for \ninstance, are not able to insure some technologies \ndon\u2019t become predominant, or that their impacts \nare mainly unpredictable or impossible to tackle. \nBut when thinking about technologies, challenges \nand opportunities, actors involved or excluded, and \nmore, accepting, or at least considering, this key \nnotion is important if we wish to act upon them \nwith the most encompassing overview1.  \n \nAlso, even if we just looked into the technological \ndimension in search of a deeper understanding of \nspecific technologies, what we should get first and \nforemost, is that no technology ever exists just by \nitself. Their invention or production is often part of \nlarger occurrence patterns shaped by wider trends \ntouching not only several other technologies, but \nother dimensions, such as the social or economic2. \nIn the particular context of Blockchain and other \nDistributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), even if in \nthe public eye it commonly seems they came out \nof nowhere as the most unique thought, we may \nobserve for instance how other decentralised \n                                                          \n1 Langdon Winner, The Whale and the Reactor: A Search for \nLimits in an Age of High Technology (Chicago, IL: University of \nChicago Press, 1986).Don Ihde, Technology and the Lifeworld: \nFrom Garden to Earth (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University \nPress, 1990).Albert Borgmann, Technology and the Character \nof Contemporary Life: A Philosophical Enquiry (Chicago, IL: \nUniversity of Chicago Press, 1987).Andrew Feenberg, \nQuestioning Technology (New York, NY: Routledge, 1999). \nWiebe E.

From \npost-war cybernetic theories or practical outputs, \nevolving into the distributed computing paradigms \nand protocols of past century\u2019s last quarter, such \nas Ethernets or the WWW, to applications made \npossible via these same paradigms and outputs, \nas GNU/Linux or other FLOSS/H systems, Torrent \nfiles, or P2P and Wiki based platforms, distributed  \nor decentralised technologies have been around \nfor a while. And they often have a reach beyond \nthe mere technological circles or uses, with other \ndimensions usually absorbing a few of their ideas, \nfrom the pervasive social and economic peaks of \nthe \u2018network society\u2019 in 1990s3, to newer forms of \n\u2018delegative political organisations\u2019 in mid 2010s4. \n \nAs a technology as many others before, \nBlockchain is to be viewed through a wide scope, \nwhich should also critically interpret claims over \nits present revolutionary and disruptive character. \nWe have come a long way, and in an incredibly \nshort period of time, from the first views on \nBitcoin, or in general the crypto space, often \nassociated with money laundering, tax evasion, \nfraud or other criminal activities. Debates now \norbit around soaring and volatile valuations of \nanything crypto, ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings), \ntrading bubbles, cryptocurrency hedge funds, and \na growing media coverage capturing the attention \nand curiosity of a general audience. Anecdotal yet \nrevealing cases of such \u2018crypto mania\u2019 include for \ninstance companies adding Blockchain in their \nname just to raise their public profile and value5. \n \nThe hype around Blockchain6 was certainly \ninfluenced or shaped by the spike of interest from \nfinancial institutions for the past 2-3 years, which \n                                                          \n3 Manuel Castells, The Rise of the Network Society (Oxford: \nBlackwel Publishers, 1996).

In \nthis sense it is one of the technologies expected \nto have a profound impact over the next 10-15 \nyears12.

In an \nincreasingly interconnected world, a vast array of \nopportunities could emerge through the \ndeployment of such technologies that could \nenable parties who are geographically distant, or \nhave no particular confidence in each other, to \nexchange any kind of digital assets, such as \nmoney, contracts, land titles, medical records, \nservices or goods, on a peer-to-peer basis with \nfewer to non-existent central intermediaries. \n \nDue to its particular combination of technical \nfeatures, Blockchain based systems are seen to \nbring on a series of benefits, such as lowering \noperational costs, enhancing safety and efficiency \nof transactions, proving ownership, origin or \nauthenticity of records, goods and content, \nexecuting contracts automatically, or avoiding \nfraud and counterfeiting. Across industries, \nbusinesses and companies, the ways they create \nvalue and conduct transactions is expected to be \nimproved by faster, cheaper and more reliable \nmechanisms enabled by Blockchain. Possible \nscenarios are also marked by deep changes in \neconomic and governance models towards \ndecentralised exchanges of value, or even more \ninclusive, transparent and accountable digital \neconomies14. \n \nYet, from the beginning of the current research \nproject we were always cautious about embarking \n                                                          \n13 Klaus Schwab, The Fourth Industrial Revolution (Geneva: \nWorld Economic Forum).

Amid unfolding \ndevelopments and uncertain futures, our project \nwas designed to follow an exploratory mode and \nbe framed as a wide-ranging overview of possible \napplications of Blockchain and other DLTs for \nindustrial / non-financial sectors. As we recognised \nthroughout the whole project crucial opportunities \naround a technology that could record, secure and \ntransfer any digitised transaction or process, at \nthe same time, we never overlooked the concrete \nchallenges for its development and uptake. \n \nFrom the beginning, this project overarching \nunderstanding was mainly directed at informing \nwhich actions could be necessary to prepare for \npotential transformations to existing or future \nEuropean sociotechnical landscapes, considering \nhow Blockchain could change how organisations \noperate at industrial and market levels. In this \nregard, the project\u2019s policy context is connected to \na number of European Commission\u2019s strategies \nand initiatives fostering digital innovation across \nall industrial sectors and supporting Small and \nMedium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) to fully benefit \nfrom new technologies15. In the specific domain of \nBlockchain and other DLTs, this engagement \nalready resulted for instance in a H2020 \nCoordination and Support Action on \u2018Blockchain \nand Distributed Ledger Technologies for SMEs\u201916 \nas part of the \u2018Innovation in Small and Medium-\nSized Enterprises\u2019 programme. \n \nBut several options on how to approach emerging \nrealities of Blockchain and other DLTs are also \nbeing explored within the European Commission. \nFor instance, the EU Blockchain Observatory and \nForum was launched in February 2018 and aims \nto monitor trends, developments and use cases \nfor the next two years17. In December 2017, the \nCommission launched the European Innovation \n                                                          \n15 European Commission, Digitising European Industry - \nReaping the Full Benefits of a Digital Single Market (European \nCommission, 2016) <https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-\nmarket/en/news/communication-digitising-european-industry-\nreaping-full-benefits-digital-single-market>.

And \nwithin the series of activities developed in the \npast year the Commission is also participating in \nInternational Organization for Standardization \n(ISO) and International Telecommunication Union \n(ITU) standardisation activities19. In addition, \nconsidering the wide financial sector, In November \n2016 the Commission in collaboration with the \nEuropean Parliament set up a Task Force on \nFintech with a dedicated group on DLTs, and \npublished in March 2018 the Financial Technology \n(FinTech) Action Plan20. And in this same sector, \nwe also find the European Financial Transparency \nGateway (EFTG) as a pilot project using DLTs to \nfacilitate access to information about all listed \ncompanies on EU securities regulated markets21.  \n \n1.2. Project Description \n \nIn this context, #Blockchain4EU: Blockchain for \nIndustrial Transformations emerges as a project in \nMarch 2017 to be a forward looking exploration \nof existing, emerging and potential applications \nbased on Blockchain and other Distributed Ledger \nTechnologies for industrial / non-financial sectors.  \n \nThis is a research project coordinated within the \nEuropean Commission by the EU Policy Lab / \nForesight, Behavioural Insights and Design for \nPolicy Unit (I.2) of the Joint Research Centre (DG \nJRC), on request of the Innovation Policy and \nInvestment for Growth Unit (F.1) of the \nDirectorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, \nEntrepreneurship & SMEs (DG GROW).  \n \nDG JRC is the European Commission\u2019s in-house \nscience and knowledge service, with a mandate to \nprovide EU policies with independent, evidence \nbased scientific and technical support throughout \n                                                          \n18 \n<https://ec.europa.eu/research/eic/index.cfm?pg=prizes_blockch\nains> \n19 <https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-\nmarket/en/news/blockchain-and-distributed-ledger-technology-\npolicy-and-standardisation-workshop> \n20 European Commission, FinTech Action Plan: For a More \nCompetitive and Innovative European Financial Sector, 2018 \n<https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/180308-action-plan-\nfintech_en>. \n21 <http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-18-\n1406_en.htm> \n10 \n \n \nthe whole policy cycle. In particular, it aims to \nanticipate emerging issues that need to be \naddressed at EU level and understand its policy \ncontexts; creates, manages and makes sense of \nknowledge; and develops innovative tools to make \nsuch knowledge available and useful for policy \nmaking. The EU Policy Lab / Foresight, Behavioural \nInsights and Design for Policy Unit encompasses \nboth an innovative way of conducting research, \nand a collaborative and experimental space that \nmakes use of a wide transdisciplinary toolbox to \nenvision, connect and prototype solutions for \nbetter policies, with strong focus on citizen-centric \nframeworks and stakeholder engagement. \n \nDG GROW is the European Commission\u2019s service \nresponsible for creating an environment in which \nEuropean firms can thrive; completing the Internal \nMarket for goods and services; helping turn the EU \ninto a smart, sustainable, and inclusive economy; \nfostering entrepreneurship and growth by \nreducing the administrative burden and \nfacilitating access to funding for small and \nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs); generating \npolicy on the protection and enforcement of \nindustrial property rights, among several other \nactivities. The main mission of its Innovation \nPolicy and Investment for Growth Unit is to \ndevelop and support initiatives contributing to a \nstronger and high-performing EU industry by \nfostering both the supply and uptake of \ninnovation. \n \nThis project is positioned on the intersection of \nScience and Technology Studies, Foresight and \nHorizon Scanning, and Design for Policy. Its main \ngoals were to: a) map and analyse Blockchain and \nother DLT applications for industry across specific \nsectors; b) scan for and explore future scenarios \nof production, distribution and use; and c) identify \nand assess prospective funding and regulatory \nactions and other broader policy options.  \n \nThe project\u2019s core outputs were aimed from the \nstart at exploring and assessing sociotechnical \nchallenges and opportunities for the development \nand uptake of Blockchain and other DLTs within \nEU industrial and business contexts, with focus on \nSMEs innovation and competitiveness. They will \nalso help to shape options for regulatory, funding \nand other broader policy responses, and \nultimately assist the European Commission and \nother EU public authorities to foresee and prepare \nfor major positive or negative changes that may \narise from potential widespread or accelerated \nadoptions in the short and medium term of \nBlockchain and other DLTs within industrial / non-\nfinancial sectors. \n \n1.3. Roadmap and Methodology \n \nThe project's roadmap was divided into two \nstages. The first one ran from start to end of the \nproject. The second one was mainly concentrated \naround three major moments. In both stages we \nwere able to develop an innovative experimental \napproach that allowed us first to select and refine \nthe sectors, topics and dimensions to be explored, \nand second to generate ideas on how Blockchain \nand other DLTs could exist in the near future and \nultimately test new narratives and plausible \nscenarios around it. It combined empirical Science \nand Technology Studies with a transdisciplinary \npolicy lab toolbox filled with theoretical and \npractical frameworks from Foresight and Horizon \nScanning, Behavioural Insights, or Participatory, \nCritical and Speculative Design.  \n \nThe first stage was based on desk research \ncoupled with several qualitative explorations, with \ntargeted engagement of technical experts and \ndevelopers; social, economic and legal \nresearchers; companies, entrepreneurs and \nbusiness representatives; civil society \norganisations and think-tanks; and public \nadministration actors, both at city, regional and \nnational levels, and at supranational level, \nincluding other European Commission services \nand agencies, the European Parliament, United \nNations, OEDC and the World Economic Forum.  \n \nWe started this stage by carrying out secondary \nresearch, with literature reviews of general \nresearch on Blockchain and other DLTs and on \ncurrent, emerging or potential applications for \nindustry across specific sectors. This resulted in \nthe mapping of around 270 key individual and \ncollective stakeholders in the field. Afterwards, we \nproceeded into conducting multiple primary \nresearch activities, combining face to face and \nonline open-ended interviews to 63 experts, two \nbatches of semi-structured online surveys with 94 \n11 \n \n \nreplies all together, and short duration multi-sited \nethnographic explorations in selected Blockchain \nrelated companies, organisations and events. As \nmentioned above, this first stage was developed \nthroughout the project\u2019s whole duration, with \nmultiple feedback loops and iterations, including \nfor example reconnecting with and interviewing \nagain previously targeted stakeholders, or \ndeploying overhauled versions of already existent \nsurveys, which allowed us to maximize our \noutreach endeavours. \n \nIn the second stage, we moved into more practical \nand experimental grounds, based on collaborative \nresearch and stakeholder engagement activities. \nThis stage\u2019s three key moments corresponded to \nthree participatory workshops, A, B, and C. These \nworkshops had distinct goals, structures and \nparticipants, but all three were still connected in a \nsequential way. Their outputs are deeply \nentrenched in the analysis and results of this \nreport as it will be visible throughout several \nchapters and sub-chapters. \n \nWorkshop A took place on July 4 2017, with the \naim of mapping multiple Blockchain present and \nfuture challenges and opportunities, especially \nconsidering their policy, economic, social, \ntechnological, legal and environmental \ndimensions. Based on a purposive sampling \ntechnique, 34 participants were selected from an \nextensive pool of stakeholders to act as a \nsnapshot of the current Blockchain ecosystem in \nindustrial and non-financial sectors. This group \nincluded technical experts, developers and \nscientists; social, economic, ethical and legal \nresearchers; entrepreneurs and investors; business \nand labour representatives; and policy actors at \nlocal, national and EU levels. Our key outputs were \nthe mapping and discussion of collective visions \nthat could inform policy on present and future \npossibilities of Blockchain applications, as well as \ncore factors that could support or hamper their \ndevelopment and uptake.  \n \nWorkshop B occurred on November 15-16 2017 \nwith emphasis on the material exploration of near \nfuture scenarios of creation, production, \ndistribution and use of Blockchain and other DLT \napplications in previously selected sectors. We \ninvited 25 participants, among which designers, \ntechnical and industry expert stakeholders, and \nsocial and economic researchers. We kick-started \nthis workshop based on what had been amassed \nthrough our research, but most significantly, \nbuilding upon core outputs of the first workshop. \nAttention was given to participatory, generative \nand speculative design methods to help us deliver \nthe intended results. Key final output was the \ncollaborative envisioning, design and creation of \nfive prototypes that could physically represent \nand exemplify how Blockchain and other DLTs \ncould be applied in a near future, considering five \nindustrial sectors and use cases. \n \nWorkshop C happened on March 15 2018 centred \non a broad spectrum discussion on policy \nstrategies for digitisation of industry and \nbusinesses, with particular focus on technology \nadoption and SME innovation. Again based on a \npurposive sample, 23 participants were mainly \ndrawn from a group of stakeholders at the \nforefront of EU digitisation and SME innovation, \nincluding industry, startups and SME \nrepresentatives; European networks or initiatives; \nthink tanks and business consultants in the field; \nand intergovernmental and international \norganisations. Our main output was a better \nunderstanding of how Blockchain and other DLTs \nfit into present and future digitisation landscapes, \nand how these technologies may potentially \naffect or impact different actors operating \noperating in more established industrial and non-\nfinancial sectors. \n \nAdditional information about each of the three \nworkshops can be found in the EU Policy Lab blog. \nMore details on methodologies and results are \navailable on request for research and \ndissemination purposes, following the Joint \nResearch Centre\u2019s EU Policy Lab open principles in \nterms of knowledge sharing and exchange of best \npractices. \n \nIn this same context, several communication \nactivities were developed on a horizontal level \nthroughout the whole project for dissemination \nand feedback on ongoing and final outcomes, \nsuch as participation in more than 20 events and \nscientific conferences. Furthermore, such activities \nwere also based on communication via external \nchannels, including institutional and personal \n12 \n \n \nsocial media accounts on Twitter, Facebook and \nLinkedin, with media coverage for the project\u2019s \nkick-off announcement in 10 digital media outlets, \nas well as through internal channels, such as the \nEU Policy Lab blog and other European \nCommission webpage, with lateral management \nof an informal community of practice with 107 \nmembers on the dedicated Connected platform of \nthe European Commission. Additional outputs are \nnow planned to complement the co-creation of \nprototypes that took place around Workshop B of \nthe project\u2019s second stage, as well as outputs \nbased on the final presentation event of the \nproject on May 24 2018. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n13 \n \n \n2. What are Blockchain and Other DLTs? \n \nThis chapter will put forward a brief account of \nwhat is Blockchain and other Distributed Ledger \nTechnologies (DLTs) from a more technical point \nof view. Such introductory understanding of its \nmain features will set groundwork for the \nsubsequent understanding of the potential of \nBlockchain for industry which will come in the next \nchapters. \n \n2.1. Key Features \n \nBlockchain and other Distributed Ledger \nTechnologies (DLTs) are technologies enabling \nparties who are geographically distant or have no \nparticular confidence in each other to exchange \nany type of digital data on a peer-to-peer basis \nwith fewer to non-existent third parties or \nintermediaries. Data could represent for instance \nmoney, insurance policies, contracts, land titles, \nmedical records, birth and marriage certificates, \nbuying and selling goods and services, or any \nother type of transaction or asset that can be \ntranslated in a digital form. \n \nTo be clear in the terminology, Blockchain is part \nof the broader family of Distributed Ledger \nTechnologies (DLTs)\n22\n. DLTs are particular types of \ndatabases in which data is recorded, shared and \nsynchronised across a distributed network of \ncomputers or participants. Blockchain technologies \nare a particular type of DLT that employs \ncryptographic techniques to record and \nsynchronize data in 'chains of blocks'. The \ndifference is about the way data is distributed, \nverified and registered by participants in the \nnetwork. In short, all types of Blockchain are DLTs \nbut not all DLTs are Blockchains. For the sake of \nsimplicity we will mostly use the term 'Blockchain' \nor 'Blockchains' but we will make the distinction \nregarding DLTs when necessary. \n \nBlockchain is a chronological database (ledger) \noperating in a distributed network of multiple \nnodes or computers that keeps track of data \n                                                          \n22 World Bank, Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and \nBlockchain, FinTech Note no1, 2017 \n<http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1779115137140\n62215/Distributed-Ledger-Technology-DLT-and-blockchain>. \ntransactions\n23\n. It's called a 'Blockchain' because of \nthe particular way transactions are recorded and \nverified. Information about a certain number of \ntransactions is organized and encrypted into \n'blocks'. Each new block is validated when the \nnodes or computers reach a consensus across the \nnetwork. There are different cryptographic ways to \nreach a consensus, the most known being Proof-\nof-Work, that is, when a node or a computer \n('miner') solves a complex mathematical puzzle, \nand the other nodes verify it.  \n \nThe whole process ensures that each block is \ncreated in a way that irrefutably links it to the \nprevious one and to the next one, thus forming a \n'chain of blocks' or 'blockchain'. This unique record \nthat forms the Blockchain is shared by each node \nor computer in the network and is constantly \nupdated and synchronized. \n \nAs a database or ledger, a blockchain creates and \nverifies records of all transactions ever executed \nacross a network. Its processes of validation and \nconstant update makes it extremely difficult for \nunauthorised changes or tampering to happen \nwithout no one noticing it or being recorded. Plus \ntransactions are open for inspection and \nvalidation anytime for anyone or for authorised \nparties. Public-private keys or cryptographic \nsignatures ensure access is protected and \nsecured. In principle it is also more resilient to \noutages or cyberattacks since it has no single \npoint of failure. The existence of multiple and \ndistributed nodes makes it very difficult to target \nthe majority simultaneously, or to break down \ncompletely the whole network. \n \nBlockchain should not be considered a new \ntechnology, but rather a unique combination of \nother existing technologies\n24\n such as peer-to-peer \nnetworks, cryptographic techniques, consensus \nprotocols, and distributed data storage. This \n                                                          \n23 Aaron Wright and Primavera De Filippi, \u2018Decentralized \nBlockchain Technology and the Rise of Lex Cryptographia\u2019, \nSSRN Electronic Journal, 2015 \n<http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2580664>. \n24 Arvind Narayanan and Jeremy Clark, \u2018Bitcoin\u2019s Academic \nPedigree\u2019, Communications of the ACM, 60.12 (2017), 36\u201345 \n<http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3132259>. \n14 \n \n \ncombination was first developed in Bitcoin, the \ndecentralised cryptocurrency originally introduced \nby Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008\n25\n. Curiously his, her \nor their identity as a developer or group of \ndevelopers is still unknown and involved in \ncontinuous speculation\n26\n. \n \nBlockchain are still often associated in the public \neye to Bitcoin and to concerns about money \nlaundering, tax evasion, fraud or other criminal \nactivities. Beyond the controversies around the \npotential uses of Bitcoin and other \ncryptocurrencies, what has recently come to the \nforeground is the potential of Blockchain as the \nunderlying technology based on a set of key \nfeatures or properties\n27\n: \n \nDecentralisation. A distributed network is run by \nmany different participants who don't necessarily \nknow each other, and there is no central authority \nto approve transactions. So it requires setting up \nfrom the beginning a consensus mechanism \ndefined as a set of rules that everyone follows to \nverify, validate and add transactions to the \nblockchain. The most known consensus \nmechanism is Proof-of-Work, which relies on the \ncomputational or processing power of the nodes \nor computers (called 'miners') to solve as quickly \nas possible a complex mathematical puzzle. Other \nconsensus mechanisms are under development \nsuch as Proof-of-Stake in which nodes have \ndifferent voting rights depending on the amount \nof resources ('stake') they possess\n28\n. \n \nReplication. Nodes or participants have a copy of \nthe ledger or the Blockchain. If copies are lost, \ndisappear or compromised, multiple other copies \n                                                          \n25 Satoshi Nakamoto, \u2018Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash \nSystem\u2019, 2008 <https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf>. \n26 See for instance news over the past years \nhttp://www.newsweek.com/2014/03/14/face-behind-bitcoin-\n247957.html; \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/business/decoding-the-\nenigma-of-satoshi-nakamoto-and-the-birth-of-bitcoin.html; \nhttps://gizmodo.com/this-australian-says-he-and-his-dead-\nfriend-invented-bi-1746958692 \n27 Paolo Tasca and Thayabaran Thanabalasingham, \u2018Ontology \nof Blockchain Technologies.

This feature makes the Blockchain \nresistant to disruptions, failures or interferences, \nthat is, in situations where nodes get disconnected \nby some reason, hardware breaks down, power \ngoes down temporarily, or other unexpected \nproblems happen. Unlike centralised systems, \nthere is no single point of failure. \n \nTransparency. The ledger or Blockchain is \naccessible to all participants or to a predefined set \nof participants. For instance, while in certain \nblockchains access to the records can be \nrestricted to certain participants, in other types of \nblockchains everyone with an Internet connection \nto the network has the same rights to access \nand/or to update the ledger according to the \nconsensus mechanism in place. So in the end \ntransactions are transparent and visible, which \nmay increase auditability and trust in the network.  \n \nTimestamping. All transactions on the Blockchain \nare time-stamped, that is, data such as details \nabout a payment, a contract, transfer of \nownership, etc., is linked publicly and immutably \nto a certain date and time. It means that no one \nshould be able to modify what has been recorded \nand timestamped. Keeping track and verifying \ninformation in a secure way is one of the key \nadvantages of the Blockchain. It makes it \nparticularly useful for different parties to check \nwhen and who made a specific transaction, or to \ncertify that data existed at a given instance in \ntime. \n \nImmutability. The way that each transaction is \ncryptographically recorded on the Blockchain and \nthen validated through consensus makes it nearly \nimpossible or very difficult (you would need to \nhave a majority of 'votes' for instance) to make \nchanges to the ledger without detection. In this \nsense, records are irreversible and tamper-proof. \nThese features of non-repudiation, non-\nforgeability and immutability guarantee that there \nis a unique and historical version of the records \nwhich is agreed and shared between all \nparticipants.  \n \nDigital Signatures. Like other internet \ntechnologies, Blockchain relies on public-private \nkey cryptography to ensure the authenticity and \n15 \n \n \nintegrity of data exchanges or transactions. \nParticipants have a distinct identity based on a \ncombination of public and private keys: public \nkeys are widely shared with the others in the \nnetwork, while private keys are kept secret. For \ninstance, messages or transactions encrypted with \na private key can only be opened by recipients \nwith the corresponding public key (shared by the \nsender). Or if a message is encrypted with a public \nkey it can only be decrypted by a specified \nrecipient using his or her private key. You can thus \nensure messages or transactions are authentic, \nthat is, they originated from the rightful person, \nand can't be accessed or modified by others. \n \nAutomation and Smart Contracts. \nTransactions can be automatically executed \nthrough the software running on the Blockchain \nwithout the need for human coordination or \nintervention. The way that transactions are \nverified and added on the Blockchain guarantees \nthat conflicts or inaccuracies are reconciled, and in \nthe end there is only one valid transaction (no \ndouble entries). Blockchain can also be the \nunderlying layer for 'smart contracts'\n29\n which are \nbasically computer programs that carry out the \nterms of any agreement between parties. These \nagreements can be recorded and validated into a \nBlockchain which can then execute and enforce \nautomatically the contracted usually under 'if-\nthen' instructions: 'if' something happens (for \ninstance if you rent and pay for a car and short \nterm insurance), 'then' certain transactions or \nactions are done (the car door unlocks and the \npayment is transferred).  \n \n2.2. Key Challenges \n \nThe set of features or properties presented above \ncan be considered as the key elements for any \nBlockchain. It should be clear, however, there isn't \njust 'a Blockchain' but many different Blockchains \n(plural) with different functionalities and \narchitectures. Such choices in design usually \ndepend on the specific purposes in mind which \n                                                          \n29 Nick Szabo, The Idea of Smart Contracts, 1997 \n<http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/C\nDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/idea\n.html>.; Vitalik Buterin, A Next-Generation Smart Contract and \nDecentralized Application Platform, 2015 \n<https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper>. \nentail trade-offs with corresponding advantages \nand limitations. \n \nMoreover, Blockchains are still early-stage \ntechnologies with many unresolved issues still \nunder development or wide discussion in the \nspace. It's crucial to take into account such \nchallenges and uncertainties when considering the \ndeployment of Blockchain technologies to \nindustrial applications as it will be addressed in \nthe next chapter. A set of key issues stand out in \nthe current Blockchain space: \n \nPermissionless and Permissioned. One of the \nmost disputed) choices of design or categorisation \nconcerns the permissionless (public) and \npermissioned (private) continuum of Blockchain \ntechnologies\n30\n. Permissionless blockchains, like \nBitcoin\n31\n, Ethereum32 or Litecoin, are distributed \nledgers where anyone can participate without \nasking prior authorisation to central authorities or \nintermediaries. It's just enough to download the \ncode or software available online and start \nrunning it in a computer. All participants can send \ntransactions across the network, access the \nrecords, and validate transactions through a \nconsensus mechanism, usually by contributing \nwith computational power ('Proof-of-Work'). \nThrough this particular type of consensus \nmechanism in return participants (or 'miners') are \nrewarded or payed with the native \ncryptocurrencies or 'coins'. \n \nPermissioned blockchains, like Ripple, Chain, \nHyperledger, are distributed ledgers in which a \n                                                          \n30 Gareth W Peters and Efstathios Panayi, \u2018Understanding \nModern Banking Ledgers Through Blockchain Technologies: \nFuture of Transaction Processing and Smart Contracts on the \nInternet of Money\u2019, in Banking Beyond Banks and Money, ed. by \nPaolo Tasca and others (Heidelberg: Springer, 2016), pp. 239\u2013\n78 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-42448-4>. \n31 For an easy-to-follow but comprehensive introduction to \nBitcoin, see Andreas Antonopoulos, Mastering Bitcoin: \nProgramming the Open Blockchain 2nd Edition (Sebastopol: \nO\u2019Reilly Media, 2017).; For a technical explanation (and with its \nown Coursera course) of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies requiring \na basic understanding of computer science, see Arvind \nNarayanan, Joseph Bonneau, and others, Bitcoin and \nCryptocurrency Technologies: A Comprehensive Introduction \n(Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2016). \n32 Ethereum Homestead Documentation \n<http://www.ethdocs.org/en/latest/>. Henning Diedrich, \nEthereum: Blockchains, Digital Assets, Smart Contracts, \nDecentralized Autonomous Organizations (Sidney: Wildfire \nPublishing, 2016). \n16 \n \n \ncompany, a consortium, or a central administrator \npreselects or gives access to identified \nparticipants. So the rights to modify, read and \naccess the Blockchain is restricted to some \nparticipants. Consensus across the network or the \nmaintenance of the Blockchain is guaranteed by \nthis private and trusted parties or intermediaries, \nunder a defined set of rules. This configuration \neliminates the need for native currencies and \nassociated 'Proof-of-Work' mechanism to run and \nprotect the ledger. Permissioned blockchains can \nbe private, like MONAX or Multichain, to be used \nmostly inside an organisation with or without \npublic access, or consortium blockchains, like R3 \nor Corda, where the consensus process is done by \na pre-selected set of parties.  \n \nThere is no agreement among technologists over \nthe exact features that distinguish permissionless \nfrom permissioned blockchains. At this point in \ntheir ongoing technical development it should be \nseen more as a spectrum, where you can also find \nfor instance hybrid blockchains combining \ndifferent aspects of both\n33\n. In some cases, \norganisations or companies can build on top of \nBlockchain platforms like Ethereum, and then \ndevelop specific applications for permissioned \nnetworks. \n \nScalability and Performance. The discussions \nover permissionless and permissioned blockchains \nbriefly explained above, have crucial implications \nfor overall deployment. Permissionless or public \nblockchains at the moment can only handle a \nlimited number of transactions because all \nparticipants or nodes verify and transmit the \ntransactions across a distributed network. For \ninstance, Bitcoin transactions are validated \napproximately every 10 minutes with around \n300,000 transactions per day. In comparison \nVisa's electronic payments processing network \nprocesses an average of 150 million transactions \nper day. \n \nBut options to scale up such type of blockchains \nare not easy to implement. Due to the original \ndesign of its architecture, there is an inbuilt limit \nin public blockchains regarding the number of \n                                                          \n33 George Danezis and Sarah Meiklejohn, \u2018Centrally Banked \nCryptocurrencies\u2019, arXiv, 2015, 1\u201316 \n<http://dx.doi.org/10.14722/ndss.2016.23187>. \ntransactions and the amount of data to be \nincluded in any given 'block'. Also as the number \nof transactions grows requirements for \nparticipants in terms of computational power and \nstorage also increases, taking into account an ever \ngrowing transaction history. \n \nFierce controversies over possible solutions stir up \nthe space from time to time, especially in Bitcoin \ncircles for instance on increasing block size (in \nBitcoin only 1MB of data can be included in any \ngiven block) or introducing new protocols based on \nsidechains or off-chains\n34\n. Others are developing \nalternative mechanisms like 'sharding' and 'Proof-\nof-Stake' still within public blockchains\n35\n to limit \nthe need for each node to validate the \ntransactions and/or store a complete copy of the \nledger. This type of restrictions is also at the core \nof permissioned or private blockchains, and it is in \nfact one of its major selling points to better \nhandle the issue of scalability. As explained above, \nthey only require a limited and predefined number \nof participants to run the network, so transactions \nare processed faster and the necessary computing \npower can be easier increased in specific nodes.  \n \nEnergy Consumption. Concerns over the energy \nnecessary to run public blockchains, especially the \nones using 'Proof-of-Work', are widespread in \nmedia and specialised circles\n36\n. This concern was \nat least partially fuelled by the boost in Bitcoin \nprices in the past two years which spurred a more \nintensive use of the network and as such, of the \n'mining' process needed to run it. As more and \nmore participants join in and 'race' to validate \ntransactions through 'mining', this competition \nlowers the possible reward to be gained, which in \nturn increases the need for more powerful \ncomputational techniques including application-\nspecific integrated circuits (ASIC), cloud mining \n                                                          \n34 Laura Shin, \u2018Will This Battle For The Soul Of Bitcoin Destroy \nIt?\u2019, Forbes, 23 October 2017 \n<https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/10/23/will-this-\nbattle-for-the-soul-of-bitcoin-destroy-it/#66179ef33d3c>. \n35 Epicenter, \u2018Vlad Zamfir: Bringing Ethereum Towards Proof-\nOf-Stake With Casper\u2019, 22 April 2017 \n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nQPcNY32JQ>.

If we \nconsider the latter estimate, it would mean each \nBitcoin transaction requires the same amount of \nenergy used to power around 30 U.S. households \nfor one day. Some say this is the trade-off for a \ndecentralised, secure and censorship resistant \nnetwork such as Bitcoin and its potential positive \nbenefits in the economy\n38\n. Others say advances in \ntechnology will make mining operations more \nefficient in the long run, more renewable energy \nsources are being explored, or the overall \nconsumption of Bitcoin is but a fraction of the \ntotal world energy consumption\n39\n. Still research \nindicates that 58% of Bitcoin mining pools are \nbased in China\n40\n due to cheap labour, land and \nelectricity. This is worrying for a number of \nreasons: electricity in China is mostly coal \npowered, and poor working and health conditions \nin mining pools have been reported\n41\n. \n \nCentralisation. Issues around 'mining' are also \nrelated to other concerns over high concentration \nor dependency in industrial-scale mining activities \nor mining pools\n42\n. In fact researchers have argued \nthat both Bitcoin and Ethereum mining suffer \nfrom centralisation, taking into account that the \ntop four miners in Bitcoin and the top three \nminers in Ethereum control more than 50% of the \n                                                          \n37 https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption \n38 Marc Bevand, \u2018Bitcoin Mining Is Not Wasteful\u2019, 25 January \n2016 <http://blog.zorinaq.com/bitcoin-mining-is-not-\nwasteful/>. \n39 Elaine Ou, \u2018No, Bitcoin Won\u2019t Boil the Oceans\u2019, Bloomberg, 7 \nDecember 2017 \n<https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-12-\n07/bitcoin-is-greener-than-its-critics-think>. \n40 Garrick Hileman and Michel Rauchs, \u20182017 Global \nCryptocurrency Benchmarking Study\u2019, SSRN Electronic Journal, \n2017 <http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2965436>. \n41 Zheping Huang and Joon Ian Wong, \u2018The Lives of Bitcoin \nMiners Digging for Digital Gold in Inner Mongolia\u2019, Quartz, 17 \nAugust 2017 <https://qz.com/1054805/what-its-like-working-\nat-a-sprawling-bitcoin-mine-in-inner-mongolia/>. \n42 Fabio Caccioli, Giacomo Livan and Tomaso Aste, \u2018Scalability \nand Egalitarianism in Peer-to-Peer Networks\u2019, in Banking \nBeyond Banks and Money, ed. by Paolo Tasca and others \n(Heidelberg: Springer, 2016), pp. 197\u2013211 \n<http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-42448-4>. \nhash rate\n43\n. This may jeopardize the security of \nsuch networks by allowing for potential collusions \nor attacks from a group of miners controlling a \nmajority of computational resources ('51% \nattack').  \n \nAn alternative would be to adopt other consensus \nmechanisms or types of blockchains like \npermissioned ones which don't require mining \nprocesses. But concerns over centralisation and \nsecurity hazards may also arise. Permissioned \nblockchains require a core group of parties to give \naccess to others and in practical terms to run the \nnetwork. It can be argued that it ends being a \ncentralised or semi-centralised model in which a \nnumber of participants retain significant control \nthat can lead to arbitrary decisions and high costs \nas it currently happens today in other systems. \n \nThis issue of centralisation in the Blockchain \nspace touches core ongoing discussions about the \nprospects for decentralised governance and \npromise of disintermediation. Still the existence of \nintermediaries is visible nowadays for instance in \nthe Bitcoin ecosystem\n44\n where you find currency \nexchanges which trade cryptocurrencies for \ntraditional currencies and vice-versa, or digital \nwallet services which manage or store \ncryptocurrencies accounts, recorded transactions \nand even private keys in some cases. Such \nintermediaries can be centralised points to gather \nusers and clients in the space and represent for \ninstance enticing targets for attacks\n45\n, or to \nintroduce changes in services not fully agreed or \nattentive to users' needs or views.  \n \nSecurity. All technologies are breakable or \nhackable or can suffer from a number of \nvulnerabilities. Security is in fact a complex \nconcept composed of many diverse factors that \ncan be internal and/or external to any technical \narchitecture. No one has yet managed to break \nthe encryption and decentralised architecture of \n                                                          \n43 Adem Efe Gencer and others, \u2018Decentralization in Bitcoin and \nEthereum Networks\u2019, arXiv Preprint arXiv:1801.03998, 2018 \n<https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03998>. \n44 Rainer B\u00f6hme and others, \u2018Bitcoin: Economics, Technology, \nand Governance\u2019, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 29.2 \n(2015), 213\u201338 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1257/jep.29.2.213>. \n45 Jen Wieczner, \u2018Hacking Coinbase: The Great Bitcoin Bank \nRobbery\u2019, Fortune, 22 August 2017 \n<http://fortune.com/2017/08/22/bitcoin-coinbase-hack/>. \n18 \n \n \npublic blockchains, although some say this might \nhappen with quantum computing (but maybe not \nin the foreseeable future)\n46\n. Moreover, there is no \nsingle central authority or intermediary that could \nbe hacked and compromise the whole network. \nBut takeovers, manipulations and collusions of \npublic blockchains are theoretically possible, for \ninstance through a potential 51% attack when a \nmajority of users has control of the hashing or \ncomputing power. \n \nOn the other hand, although they provide \nadvantages in terms of scalability and energy \nconsumption, private or permissioned blockchains \nare potentially more vulnerable to attacks, \ncensure, collusion or other dishonest interventions. \nOne of the major trade-offs of a smaller number \nof core participants is precisely the higher \nlikelihood of side agreements or schemes to \nchange the rules or revert transactions. \n \nAnother major source of security vulnerability lies \non the challenges around key management, one \nof the main tenets of a cryptographic based \nsystem such as Blockchain\n47\n. The responsibility \nand burden for participants to manage their public \nand private keys can be as simple and serious as \nlosing a phone or a backup of the credentials. This \ncan easily end up in desperate situations from \ngarbage diving, hypnotism to mental breakdowns \nin face of lost fortunes\n48\n. For these reasons but \nalso for simplicity of use, many people rely on \nthird parties in the Blockchain space such as \nmining companies or digital wallet services \nespecially the ones that keep the account's private \n                                                          \n46 Amy Castor, \u2018Why Quantum Computing\u2019s Threat To Bitcoin \nAnd Blockchain Is A Long Way Off\u2019, Forbes, 25 August 2017 \n<https://www.forbes.com/sites/amycastor/2017/08/25/why-\nquantum-computings-threat-to-bitcoin-and-blockchain-is-a-\nlong-way-off/#56ea01322882>. \n47 ENISA, Distributed Ledger Technology & Cybersecurity: \nImproving Information Security in the Financial Sector, 2016 \n<https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/blockchain-\nsecurity>. \n48 Mark Frauenfelder, \u2018\u2018I Forgot My Pin: An Epic Tale of Losing \n$30,000 in Bitcoin\u2019, Wired, 29 October 2017 \n<https://www.wired.com/story/i-forgot-my-pin-an-epic-tale-of-\nlosing-dollar30000-in-bitcoin/>.

The way Blockchain ensures transactions \nare visible to all and indisputably authenticated by \nunique keys or credentials can be a matter of \nconcern when it comes to protection of personal, \nsensitive or confidential data. It is currently one of \nmost disputed issues in the Blockchain space, a \nstill unsolved trade-off between transparency and \nprivacy.

For \nthis reason many companies are more inclined \ntowards permissioned blockchains in which \ndistinct layers of access to data can be configured \nto allow only access to specific participants and/or \nspecific points in time. It allows for different \ndisclosures of data, from completely public \nrecords to all participants, restricted access to \ninformation between two or more parties, up to \nprivate information only visible to one participant. \n \nBut when it comes to privacy, contrary to initial \nand still recurrent fears or misconceptions, public \nor permissionless blockchains are not anonymous \nbut rather pseudoanonymous\n50\n. Taking the \nexample of Bitcoin, on one hand transactions are \nnot tied to real identities (anyone can transfer \nBitcoin to others through private keys with no \npersonal information) and are randomly \ntransmitted over the peer-to-peer network. But on \nthe other hand transactions can still be de-\nanonymised through a number of different \ntechniques\n51\n. Research has showed for instance it \nis possible in over 60% of cases to link an \nindividual\u2019s personally identifiable information to \n                                                          \n49 Jeff John Roberts, \u2018How Bitcoin Is Stolen: 5 Common \nThreats\u2019, Fortune, 8 December 2017 \n<http://fortune.com/2017/12/08/bitcoin-theft/>. \n50 Aaron van Wirdum, \u2018Is Bitcoin Anonymous?

For instance, JPMorgan Chase recently \nworked with Zcash to add zero-knowledge \nfunctionality to Quorum, its own private Ethereum \nbased distributed ledger\n53\n. \n \nMutability. Another major issue of disagreement \nrevolves around if Blockchain is indeed \n\u2018immutable\u2019. As seen before, it\u2019s still a technology \nvulnerable to threats and attacks which may \nhypothetically allow individuals or groups to \nchange the records or revert transactions. Still \nsuch a systemic attack hasn\u2019t occurred yet in any \nknown Blockchain system. Instead the main issue \nhere concerns another key Blockchain feature \naccording to which participants can vote or choose \nto make changes or alter the record. In fact this is \na key design in a decentralised network based on \ncryptographic techniques such as Blockchain in \nwhich decisions and relationships between \nparticipants are governed by consensus \nmechanisms. In a strict sense, this means that \nimmutability should not be understood as \n\u2018unchangeable\u2019, but rather hard to change\n54\n. \n \nChanging the record of transactions or simply a \nBlockchain via consensus has happened before. \nOne of the most controversial cases was \u2018The DAO \nhack\u2019\n55\n.

After its launch on April 30th 2016, it \nraised $150 million worth of Ether (native \ncryptocurrency of Ethereum) from roughly 11000 \ninvestors, considered at the time the biggest \ncrowdfunding in history. However, on June 17 The \nDAO was hacked by someone who discovered a \nbug in the code and stole over $50 million. This \nspurred a fierce debate between those who \nadvocated for the reversal of the illicit \ntransaction, and those adamant that the attacker \nsimply exploited a technical loophole. In the end \nthe consensus was to reserve the theft by \nrestoring the original balance of The DAO through \na splitting or \u2018forking\u2019 of Ethereum.  \n \nMost importantly this case generated a wide \ndiscussion over what immutability, openness and \ntrust means in Blockchain systems\n56\n. It laid bare \nthe centrality of governance as in reality \nBlockchain relies on a set of agents (developers, \nminers, users and other participants) that have \nspecific roles and can intervene in specific \nmoments when it\u2019s necessary to fix problems, \nupgrade the system or reverse unintended \nconsequences. \n                                                          \n56 Primavera De Filippi, \u2018A $50M Hack Tests the Values of \nCommunities Run by Code\u2019, Motherboard, 11 July 2016 \n<https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qkjz4x/thedao>. \nTjaden Hess, River Keefer and Emin G\u00fcn Sirer, \u2018Ethereum Is \nInherently Secure Against Censorship\u2019, 5 July 2016 \n<http://hackingdistributed.com/2016/07/05/eth-is-more-\nresilient-to-censorship/>.

Blockchain Possibilities in Nine Industrial Sectors \nMultiple actors beyond the financial sector are \nnow observing that Blockchain and other DLTs \ncould enable major transformations of products, \nprocesses and business models across their \noperational spaces. Promises of transparent, \nsecure or decentralised ways to manage nearly all \nkinds of data and digital assets are being taken \ninto consideration in an extended range of \napplications where it became key to move from \nsiloed systems to shared infrastructures. \n \nTo explore this sociotechnical landscape we chose \nnine sectors where Blockchain based applications \nare reaching interesting early stage development, \nor where existing problems present themselves as \npotentially primed to be tackled by Blockchain \nfeatures as explored in the previous chapter. \n \nIn each sector we signal an already existent \napplication and the organisations behind it, in \norder to provide a better connection between \nabstract and empirical levels in such a complex \nfield. There is no predefined order for these \nsectors, and the criteria for categorisation mainly \ncorresponds to a simplified synthesis of other \nsectorial lists or catalogues currently in use by the \nEuropean Commission when dealing with \nentrepreneurship, digitisation and wider industrial \npolicies in the internal single market57. \n \n3.1. Space and Aeronautics \n \n \n \n                                                          \n57  See for instance < \nhttps://www.clustercollaboration.eu/> and \n<https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors_en> \nBlockchain and other DLTs could have a number of \napplications to key activities in aeronautics and \nspace, such as use and protection of sensitive  \ndata, encrypted communications, verification of \nquality and security standards, distributed \ninformation processing, or overall network \nmanagement and security. \n \nBlockchain architectures make it very hard or \nnearly impossible to change data without \ndetection. In this sense, records of transactions or \ndata flows are irreversible and tamper-proof. This \nfeature of immutability can be used to verify the \nintegrity of highly sensitive data in critical \nsystems, satellites, nuclear command and control \nsystems, or weapon systems. For instance, \nBlockchain based systems could monitor if \nsomeone accessed a particular piece of data and if \nwas modified, hacked, stolen or misused for other \npurposes\n58\n. It could potentially strengthen cyber \ndefence infrastructures through quicker detections \nof data breaches and vulnerabilities. \n \nbox01 = Use Case on Space Environments  \n \nIn NASA recent reflections on Distributed \nSpacecraft Missions (DSM) for Earth Science, \nBlockchain systems could support operational \ncoordination and dynamic tasking between \nexisting satellite, airborne and ground sensors. \nHere the purpose would be to develop an \ninteroperable environment to host shared copies \nof particular datasets across multiple teams, grant \naccess permissions, or publish data to user \nspecified locations. All this in a distributed system \nthat could make space based sensor networks \nmore efficient, faster and less exposed to \ncorruption or disruptive uses\n59\n. A decentralised \narchitecture such as Blockchain could be also \n                                                          \n58 Galois, \u2018Galois and Guardtime Federal Awarded $1.8M \nDARPA Contract to Formally Verify Blockchain based Integrity \nMonitoring System\u2019, 13 September 2016 \n<https://galois.com/news/galois-guardtime-formal-\nverification/>. \n59 Dan Mandl, \u2018Bitcoin, Blockchains and Efficient Distributed \nSpacecraft Mission Control\u2019, in NASA Goddard IS&T Colloquium \nLecture Series, 2017 <https://sensorweb.nasa.gov/Bitcoin \nBlockchains and Distributed Satellite Management Control 9-\n15-17v12.pdf>. \n21 \n \n \nintegrated with other software networking \narchitectures, deep learning techniques and fuzzy \nlogic. This next generation decentralised \ncomputing infrastructure could combine \nBlockchain and AI to allow satellites to make \ndecisions quickly and independently at a distance \nin a resilient, efficient and safe way\n60\n. \n \n \nThe decentralised feature of Blockchain, that is, to \noperate across a network of nodes or computers, \ncould be embedded in space hardware and \nsoftware. Such systems could connect different \ntechnologies and devices with each other, such as \nsensors, satellites, artificial intelligence systems, or \nother points of processing and control.  \n \nAnother potential application is to leverage \nsatellite communications to improve the \nperformance of Blockchain systems for instance \nin Machine-to-Machine (M2M) / Internet of Things \n(IoT) scenarios. In these cases, nodes could send \ntransactions and receive validated blocks via \nsatellite. The advantage is that satellites could \nbroadcast at high speed allowing nodes to be \nsynchronised quicker and also reach nodes not \nnecessarily connected to usual networks\n61\n. \n \nFor instance, the European Space Agency (ESA) is \nconducting the project 'Blockchain for Space \nActivities'\n62\n within their Big Data related \ninitiatives. The overall aim is develop and \nprototype a set of Blockchain technologies to \nenable secured and traceable exploitation of data \nfrom space related activities, leveraging for \ninstance on growing availability of large sets of \ndata from missions such as the Sentinels, Euclid, \nor Galileo. The goal is to enable both end-users \nand data providers, in particular from private \n                                                          \n60 Jin Wei, RNCP\u202f: A Resilient Networking and Computing \nParadigm for NASA Space Exploration, 2017 \n<https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/strg/ecf17/RNCP\n>. \n61 See for instance the second call for the European Space \nAgency (ESA) MakerSpace for the SatCom IoT space, in \nparticular Challenge 7 \"Develop a demonstrator test bed for a \nBlockchain implementation over satellite using open-source \ntools\", <http://www.dcualpha.ie/2017/10/981/> \n62 European Space Agency, \u2018GSTP Element 1 \u201cDevelop\u201d \nCompendium of Potential Activities 2017\u2019, 2017 \n<http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/ESTEC/News/GSTPE1-\nDevelopCompendium2017.pdf>. \nsector, to access data remotely in a secure and \ntraceable way. Smart contracts could be set up \namong farmers who explore land that can be \nmonitored from space, and a bank or insurer could \nlend money through micro-credit to the farmers \ndepending on the status and outcomes of crops. \nNew types of digital marketplaces could be \ncreated for many other assets with an economic \nvalue (infrastructures, buildings, forests, water \nsources, etc.) that are monitored from space. Such \nassets could be transacted between other actors \nsuch as fishers, builders, resource managers, \ndevelopment agencies, cooperatives, banks, urban \nand rural planners. \n \nStill within aeronautics companies but with cross-\nsectoral applicability, Blockchain technologies \ncould be used for as a transparent and immutable \ndatabase to monitor the entire supply chain \ntogether with suppliers and manufacturers\n63\n. That \nis, such systems could help track the location, use, \nquality and compliance of products and parts in a \ndistributed manufacturing model. Files for certain \nparts for an airplane could be sent and 3D-printed \nat a nearby or local factory. All files can encode \nthe adequate quality and security standards and a \nsmart contract could verify the terms of the \ntransaction or operation.  \n \nOther wider applications in the aerospace industry \ncould use Blockchain for simplification and \nincreased efficiency of administrative and \noperational processes. It includes for instance \nstreamlining procurement with the added value of \nfaster and accurate payments, audit trails, and \nreal time access and updates, or information and \ndocumentation management that could \nindividualise data access and track changes to \ndata, or even voting processes through Blockchain \nsystems that could ensure immutability and \nsecurity of the whole process and across parties \noften geographically distant\n64\n \n65\n. \n                                                          \n63 Airbus, Blockchain: The Trust Protocol, 2017 \n<http://www.airbus.com/newsroom/news/en/2017/03/Blockchai\nn.html>. \n64 For more information on ESA activities, see \n<https://www.esa.int/About_Us/Digital_Agenda/Beyond_Bitcoin\n_Leveraging_the_Blockchain_for_Space_4.0> Torben David, \nDistributed Ledger Technology: Leveraging Blockchain for ESA \n\u2019S Success, 2017 \n<http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/corporate/Distributed_Ledge\nr_Technology_Leveraging_Blockchain_for_ESA_s_Success_Fin\nal_Annex.pdf>. \n22 \n \n \n \n3.2. Food Processing and Distribution \n \n \nBlockchain and other DLTs have the potential to \nimprove a number of processes in the food \nprocessing, manufacturing and distribution, such \nas ascertaining origin or provenance, public health \nand safety compliance, organic certification, or \noverall transactions along a vast supply chain of \nproducers, distributors, retailers, suppliers and \nconsumers. \n \nBlockchain allows for any type of asset and \nassociated transaction to be recorded, certified \nand tracked between parties, no matter their \nphysical distance. Its features of timestamping, \nimmutability and digital signatures guarantees \nthat a product was processed or distributed by a \nspecific actor at a specific date and time, with little \nto no chance for anyone to change that record. For \nfood distributors and retailers, Blockchain based \nsystems can provide an accurate and updated \nrecord of products along its production, shipment \nand sale, helping for instance in case of outbreaks \nto determine more quickly and precisely the points \nof contamination\n66\n. It could also enhance \nefficiency for real-time management of food \nstocks and delivery, and help for instance to \nidentify where and why food is thrown out or \nexpired and thus potentially reduce food waste.  \n \n                                                                                    \n65 Giulio Prisco, \u2018NASA, ESA Considering Innovative Applications \nof Blockchain Technology\u2019, Bitcoin Magazine, 20 February 2018 \n<https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/nasa-esa-considering-\ninnovative-applications-blockchain-technology/>. \n66 Roger Aitken, \u2018IBM & Walmart Launching Blockchain Food \nSafety Alliance In China With Fortune 500\u2019s JD.com\u2019, Forbes, \n14 December 2017 \n<https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogeraitken/2017/12/14/ibm-\nwalmart-launching-blockchain-food-safety-alliance-in-china-\nwith-fortune-500s-jd-com/#162edeb77d9c>. \nTraceability and quality control for how products \nare grown, stored, inspected and transported, that \nis, from the farm to the fork, could enhance \naccountability for all involved including suppliers, \nregulators and consumers. In a Blockchain system, \neveryone has access to and a copy of the same \nupdated record (features of replication and \ntransparency), so relevant parties can verify or \ninspect it at any time or at specific moments. \n \nIt confers a certain level of trust about \ntransactions between distant and often unknown \nparties in global food chains. Most data is still \nstored on paper or in centralised databases that \nare costly, unreliable, and prone to inaccuracies, \nhacking, unintentional errors or frauds along a \ncomplex network of actors. It also offers an \nirrevocable, authenticated and time-stamped \nhistory of products for keeping track not only of \nfood safety but also ethical standards. Proof of \norigin and compliance with environmental rules, \norganic labelling, fair trade or other type of \ncharacteristics could help consumers to make \ninformed decisions, and steer companies towards \nmore sustainable business models\n67\n. \n \nbox02 = Use Case on Food and Drinks \n \nLondon based startup Provenance is working with \nover 200 retailers and producers in the food and \ndrinks sector to use Blockchain technology to help \ndemonstrate the provenance of their physical \nproducts\n68\n. The overall goal is to improve \ntransparency and secure traceability for any \nmaterials, ingredients and products. In a pilot with \nThe Co-op, the world\u2019s largest consumer co-\noperative, they were able to track fresh produce \nfrom origin to supermarket, using real-time data \ngathered throughout the entire supply chain to \nprove its journey and credentials. In another pilot, \nBlockchain technology, mobile phones and smart \ntags, were used to track yellowfin and skipjack \ntuna fish in Indonesia from catch to consumer, or \n                                                          \n67 Jutta Steiner, \u2018Blockchain Can Bring Transparency to Supply \nChains\u2019, 19 June 2015 \n<https://www.businessoffashion.com/community/voices/discuss\nions/does-made-in-matter/op-ed-blockchain-can-bring-\ntransparency-to-supply-chains>. \n68 Provenance, \u2018Blockchain: The Solution for Transparency in \nProduct Supply Chains\u2019, 21 November 2015 \n<https://www.provenance.org/whitepaper>. \n23 \n \n \nfrom origin to point of sale (POS). This monitoring \nenables proof of compliance to standards and \nsocial sustainability claims for instance by the \nfishermen, authenticate these certificates along \nthe chain and put in place an open and \ntransparent system for food and other physical \ngoods.  \n \n \nSafeguarding the accuracy of food certificates and \npreventing risks of fraud and adulteration, could \nbe supported by Blockchain based systems. A \ntrusted registration of products\u2019 attributes and \ntransactions, together with easy transfer of import \nand export certificates, could be the basis for more \nopen ecosystems of producers, growers, traders, \nlogistics companies, product standard \norganisations or certification scheme owners, \ndata/information standard organisations, ICT \nservices and solution providers, certification \norganisations,  supervisory authorities such as \naccreditation authorities and food safety \nauthorities, financial service providers such as \nbanks and investors, and consumers\n69\n. It could be \nparticularly useful for smaller farmers and \ncooperatives if it could facilitate digital \ncertification, direct information flows and \nmarketing to consumers, or even automate a \nnumber of transactions and procedures using \nsmart contracts with other stakeholders such as \ndistributors and retailers. \n \nSuch food certification is at the core of the \nproduction and sale of goods for instance with \nprotected designations of origin (PDO), such as \nthose awarded to regional products. It is expected \nthat more companies could experiment with the \nintegration of Blockchain technologies with mobile \nphones, smart tags and other IoT devices to scan \nQR codes in their products\u2019 labels and access \ninformation in a blockchain about their origin, \nproduction process, quality, expiry dates, lot \nnumbers, and so on. \n \nBlockchain could also be used to authenticate and \ntrace the origin of high-value, rare and luxury \ngoods in the food industry, such as wine. Fraud \n                                                          \n69 Lan Ge and others, Findings from the Pilot Study Blockchain \nfor Agriculture and Food (Wageningen Economic Research, \n2017) <www.wur.eu/economic-research>. \nand counterfeit products are a costly burden for \nmany companies dealing with lost revenue and \ncompromises in their reputation. Authenticity and \nprovenance of a particular bottle of wine for \ninstance could exist in a blockchain through a \nregistry of its unique 'thumbprint' composed of \nhigh-resolution photographs, ownership and \nstorage records and even a certification for the \nphysical bottle\n70\n. This digital representation of a \nbottle is further complemented by inputs from \ncertified wine producers, licensed vendors and \nother authenticators. Different stakeholders such \nas retailers, warehouses, auctions houses, buyers \nand consumers can verify the provenance and the \ncorresponding value of the wine (and bottle) in \nquestion. \n \n3.3. Transports and Logistics \n \n \nApplications of Blockchain and other DLTs for \ntransports and logistics sectors range from overall \nsupply chain and fleet management, asset transfer \nand movements, security of data exchanges, \nprocessing of import/export customs \ndocumentation, and automatic execution of \ncontract terms between parties, up to proof of \norigin and conformity to safety rules, and tracking \nof sensitive materials or products\n71\n. \n \nAny kind of physical asset, supply and \nmerchandise, together with movements or \ntransfers between involved parties, can be \ncryptographically registered and tracked through a \nBlockchain system. Through its inherent features, \nBlockchain could offer near real-time data \n                                                          \n70 See <https://www.winefraud.com/chai-wine-vault/> \n71 Phillip Boucher, Susana Nascimento and Mihalis Kritikos, \u2018How \nBlockchain Technology Could Change Our Lives\u2019, European \nParliamentary Research Service, 2017, 24 \n<http://dx.doi.org/10.2861/926645>. \n24 \n \n \nintegrity for transports and logistics sectors that \nmostly rely on a global and distributed supply \nchains of distant and untrusting actors including \nmanufacturers, shipping lines, freight forwarders, \nport and terminal operators, and customs \nauthorities. All of them constantly need to \nexchange information for instance about the \norigin of goods, tariff codes, classification data, \nimport/export certificates, manifests and loading \nlists, customs values, or status updates\n72\n. \nTransparent, secure and paperless flows of data \ncould greatly reduce time and costs associated \nwith current intermediaries, frauds, losses or \nduplications, and in the end assure overall \nconformity and delivery of goods.  \n \nNowadays documentation to process and verify \nany cross-border shipping is done manually most \nof times and operational information is often \ntransmitted over the phone, email or fax. Such \nprocesses are prone to errors, manipulations and \ndelayed communication. If inserted in a blockchain \nfor instance documents such as traditional bill of \nlading about a shipment of any good could be \nsecurely submitted, validated and approved across \nport authorities, security departments, customs, \nterminal operators and all other parties involved\n73\n.   \n \nIf Blockchain is coupled with other technologies \nsuch as artificial intelligence and data analytics, \nverification tools could automatically process \ndocuments for authenticity and compliance. Or if \ncoupled with facial recognition technology, \nBlockchain could enable terminal and asset \noperators to log through digital credentials and \nmonitor goods or equipment. It could help to \nspeed up required cargo control and clearance in \nports, terminals and warehouses. \n \nOr if coupled with IoT devices, Blockchain could \nallow for instance for monitoring data about \ncontainers in ships, planes, trucks or other \ntransports, regarding for instance the \ncharacteristics of the load, location, shipping \n                                                          \n72 Wolfgang Lehmacher, \u2018Why Blockchain Should Be Global \nTrade\u2019s next Port of Call\u2019, World Economic Forum, 23 May \n2017 <https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/05/blockchain-\nports-global-trades/>. \n73 Ian Allison, \u2018Ship Operator Maersk Testing Blockchain Tech to \nReplace Bill of Lading\u2019, Newsweek (21, 2016) \n<http://www.newsweek.com/ship-operator-maersk-testing-\nblockchain-tech-replace-bill-lading-512506>. \nconditions such as humidity and temperature, or \nspecific instructions. Such encrypted and crucial \ndata could be made accessible to only authorised \nparties along the supply chain based on smart \ncontracts. Cargo management could also be \noptimised for instance by tokenizing cargo \nreservations, that is, to link a cryptocurrency token \nto a transaction, with the goal of incentivising \nsuppliers to prevent unfilled shipments or \noverbooking by carriers\n74\n. \n \nbox03 = Use Case on Shipping Containers \n \nThe SmartLog\n75\n project is a Proof of Concept (PoC) \ncurrently developing a Blockchain solution for \noperational data transfer traffic in logistics \nindustry.

The goal is to \nreduce end-to-end cargo transit times along two \nTEN-T core network corridors in the Baltics, \nnamely the ScanMed and the North Sea \u2013 Baltic. \nIoT devices are attached to shipping containers to \nkeep track of actual movements and added to a \nBlockchain system, in this case based on \nHyperledger. This secure and unique record is \nshared between all participating companies along \nthe supply chain, with the goal of improving \noperational flows, resource management and \nroute optimization planning. In the future, data \ncould flow seamlessly between the companies\u2019 \noperational information management systems \nusing Blockchain systems, within a transparent \nand encrypted multi-party transaction ecosystem. \n \nData silos and fragmented software systems, \nsuch as Transport, Warehousing and Customs \nManagement Systems, and Enterprise Resource \nPlanning Systems used by most businesses, \nprevent in practice an efficient sharing of \ninformation between a decentralised chain of \n                                                          \n74 Sara L M Golden and Allison Price, Sustainable Supply Chains: \nBetter Global Outcomes with Blockchain, 2018 \n<https://newamerica.org/documents/2067/BTA_Supply_Chain_R\neport_r2.pdf>. \n75 See <https://smartlog.kinno.fi/>  \n25 \n \n \nshippers, freight forwarders, carriers, warehouses, \ncustoms authorities, government authorities, \nglobal terminal operators, road transport \ncompanies and many others. In principle there is \nan added value to develop open digital platforms \nfor streamlining and standardising information \nflows, all potentially interconnected with global \nquality tracking systems to coordinate \ninternational quality assurance operations, and \nmaintain records of standards compliance for \ngeographically distributed actors\n76\n. \n \nAnother application of Blockchain and other DLTS \nin the transports and logistics sectors concerns \ninventory and supply chain finance, especially in \ncountries where SMEs are the main players \noperating warehouses, delivering containers with \ntrucks, barges or trains, and/or providing customs \nclearance services\n77\n. For instance in a post \nshipment scenario, a consignment note for a \ndelivered cargo could be made available on a \nBlockchain system, triggering the payment of the \ninvoice based on a smart contract. Or for in-transit \nfinancing scenarios, information about the \ninventory at a Logistics Service Provider could be \nreadily accessible to financing parties, which could \nthen provide credit more quickly to SMEs or \nincrease the percentage of the financed inventory. \nIt could potentially stimulate more agile business \nmodels between financial institutions, logistics \nproviders, shippers and receivers, all working in the \nsame ecosystem. \n \nAs cross-sectoral applications, Blockchain could be \nused to track assets coming from other industries \nby providing an updated, encrypted and irrevocable \nrecord about a product\u2019s lifecycle, including \nprovenance, raw materials, producer and supplier \ninformation, manufacturing details, distribution \nroutes, or certificates. Counterfeit and/or illicit \nmaterials, products, or dangerous substances have \na huge cost for regulators, industry and producers \nat a global scale, and represent a challenge when \nit comes to overall protection of global supply \nchains and enforcement of health and safety \nregulations. Blockchain systems could potentially \n                                                          \n76 <https://www.maersk.com/press/press-release-\narchive/maersk-and-ibm-to-form-joint-venture>  \n77 Aljosja Beije and Janjoost Jullens, A Lead via Blockchain \nTechnology: Position Paper on a Digital Port of Rotterdam, 2016 \n<http://www.blocklab.nl/media/uploads/2017/09/A-lead-via-\nBlockchain-Technology.pdf?x54716>. \nprovide resilient and shared registries of such \nassets under common protocols to be used by \ncustoms authorities, rights holders and logistics \noperators for more effective decision-making and \nfaster actions against potential infringements\n78\n. \n \n3.4. Health and Biopharmaceuticals \n \n \nApplications of Blockchain and other DLTS in the \nhealth and biopharmaceuticals are being explored \nregarding for instance electronic medical records, \nidentity management, data authentication and \nsharing, interoperable systems between healthcare \nproviders and other stakeholders, pre-\nauthorisation payment infrastructure, claims \nmanagement, clinical trial, counterfeit drug \nprevention and detection, among many others79. \n \nBlockchain relies on public-private keys to ensure \nthe authenticity and integrity of data exchanges \nbetween different parties, all recorded in an \nirrevocable and time-stamped record or ledger. \nPatients, doctors, hospitals and other healthcare \nproviders could store electronic health records in \nBlockchain based decentralised management \nsystems, in which they are able to encrypt \npersonal and/or sensitive information and grant \naccess to records only to authorised parties via \nappropriate credentials\n80\n. The capacity to record \n                                                          \n78 See \n<https://euipo.europa.eu/ohimportal/en/web/observatory/blocka\nthon/challenges/customs-authority> and \n<https://euipo.europa.eu/knowledge/course/view.php?id=3038>  \n79 Sean Hogan and others, Healthcare Rallies for Blockchains: \nKeeping Patients at the Center, 2016 \n<https://public.dhe.ibm.com/common/ssi/ecm/gb/en/gbe03790us\nen/GBE03790USEN.PDFN.PDF>. \n80 Ariel Ekblaw and others, A Case Study for Blockchain in \nHealthcare: \u2018 MedRec \u2019 Prototype for Electronic Health Records \nand Medical Research Data, IEEE Technology and Society \nMagazine, 2016 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/OBD.2016.11>.

It \ncould stimulate new business models for privacy-\npreserving solutions, personalised medicine, data \nsharing for drug, treatment and public health \nresearch purposes, or even selling, buying and re-\nmarketing for any number of stakeholders. \n \nData confidentiality and security is a major \nconcern in this sector, so any Blockchain solutions \nneed to put in place strong privacy mechanisms \nand in compliance with data protection regulation. \nFor instance, from the viewpoint of the patient \ntheir data could be pseudonymised or anonymised \nthrough robust de-identification and encryption \ntechnologies. Patients could implement dynamic \nconsents through smart contracts, that is, define \ndata access rights stating for example the type of \ndata to be given, intended uses, authorised third \nparties, conditions for revocation or storage limits. \nIn these conditions they could more easily share \ntheir records and ask for second opinions to \ndifferent doctors, find other patients with similar \ncondition, or provide their information for research \npurposes to biomedical centres and universities\n81\n. \n \nbox04 = Use Case on Clinical Trials \n \nBlockchain could have an impact on accountability \nand transparency in clinical trials reporting and \nmanagement processes82. Data and metadata that \nneeds to be circulated in a clinical trial between \nmultiple stakeholders (sponsors, researchers, \npatient groups, regulatory agencies, registries, \nstatisticians, drug suppliers, patients, data \nmanager, trial monitors, etc.), could be \ntimestamped and cryptographically stored on a \nblockchain. Researchers could greatly benefit from \nsharing anonymised raw data, datasets or \nstatistical analysis plans in clinical trials through \n                                                                                    \n<https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Document\ns/public-sector/us-blockchain-opportunities-for-health-\ncare.pdf>. \n81 See <http://www.myhealthmydata.eu> Rocco Panetta and \nLorenzo Cristofaro, \u2018A Closer Look at the EU-Funded My Health \nMy Data Project\u2019, Digital Health Legal, 2016, 10\u201311 \n<http://www.myhealthmydata.eu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/11/DHL-November-2017-p10-11.pdf>. \n82 Mehdi Benchoufi and Philippe Ravaud, \u2018Blockchain Technology \nfor Improving Clinical Research Quality\u2019, Trials, 18.1 (2017), 1\u20135 \n<http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13063-017-2035-z>. \ndistributed and secure channels. Smart contracts \n(as computer programs or agreements between \ndifferent parties that are executed automatically \naccording to the terms specified) could also be \nused for clinical trial phase control. Patients could \ngive specific consents for data analysis for \ninstance under the condition that the database is \nnot shared with third parties and/or used for \ncommercial purposes. \n \nOverall Blockchain could introduce changes on \nhow data is used and managed within the health \nsector. Nowadays health data is still fragmented, \nsiloed and opaque or under the control of a few \ndominant stakeholders. Blockchain could provide \npermanent records to be verified and accessed \nwith a greater level of speed, security and \nopenness for everyone involved or with the \nadequate authorisation. \n \nOther applications interlinked with other sectors \nsuch transports and logistics, Blockchain systems \ncould be used to record and track \nbiopharmaceutical products along their supply \nchains\n83\n. Drugs and other products could be \ntagged with IoT devices, authenticated and \nrecorded in a blockchain, which could prevent \nand/or allow for quicker detection of counterfeits, \nthefts or misplacements along a complex \nmultiparty network of producers, manufacturers, \nregulatory agencies, suppliers, distributors and \nothers. It could help to keep track of required \nenvironmental conditions for transport of \npharmaceuticals and other healthcare products, \nsuch as temperature and time. Overall Blockchain \nbased systems could support companies to prove \ncompliance with mandatory quality controls, speed \nup logistics, minimize errors and costs, and overall \nimprove transparency of the whole supply chain. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n83 Modum.io, White Paper - Data Integrity for Supply Chain \nOperations, Powered by Blockchain Technology, 2017 \n<https://modum.io/whitepaper/>. \n27 \n \n \n3.5. Creative Industries \n \n \nWithin the sector of creative industries taken in a \nbroad sense to encompass digital knowledge and \ninformation, Blockchain and other DLTs could be \napplied for intellectual property and content \nmanagement for any type of digital work (books, \nmusic, art, games, photos, texts, etc.), for instance \nfor ownership and sub-licensing rights, payments \nand financial transactions, metadata on creation \nand consumption of content, or authentication \nsystems for information value and reliability. \n \nAs a database or ledger, a blockchain can store an \nencrypted, transparent and irrevocable record of \nall data exchanges in a multiparty ecosystem. \nFrom here emerges the possibility of creating a \nshared database to register ownership rights, \nlicensing terms and royalty rules, globally \naccessible and potentially validated by all parties \ndepending on the type of consensus mechanisms \nin place. An immutable and tamper-proof register \nof all sales, licences, loans, donations and other \ntransfers of original works would help authors or \nartists to track when and who is using their work \nand specify royalty fees. Consumers or buyers \ncould also more easily verify the real owner of the \ncontent, the type of version, the set of rights \nattached to it, and agree to the terms set by the \nrights holders. \n \nOrganisations and entities involved in the music \nand media business, like record labels, publishers, \nperforming rights societies, streaming services, \nmanagers, artists and startups, could greatly \nbenefit from such a record to counter lost or \nmisdirected rights revenues. Blockchain could be \nthe technological basis of such a concerted \neffort84, despite previous unsuccessful attempts \nto build single online copyright and information \nportals for musical works85.  \n \nbox05 = Use Case on Music Licences \n \nUjo Music86 is a music software services company \ndeveloping an Ethereum based platform that \nallows musicians to automatically license and sell \ntheir work using smart contracts and associated \ncryptocurrencies. A piece of music is inserted and \npublished publicly in the ledger as belonging to the \nartist, also including licensing terms to allow \nconsumers or buyers to compensate the artist \naccording to the terms set out in smart contracts. \nAs a first demonstrator, for instance they worked \nwith Imogen Heap in 2016 to release the track \n\u2018Tiny Human\u2019 through a direct fan-to-artist \npayment scheme. In the future it could be possible \nfor artists and consumers to have portable digital \nidentities running on a blockchain but interoperable \nwith streaming services like Soundcloud, YouTube \nand other online music services. By digitising and \nauthenticating rights and metadata and making \nthem accessible, such open ecosystems could \nreduce the barriers of entry for new artists, \nsimplify licensing and rights management, \nfacilitate immediate payments to owners and \ncreators, and enable new applications, products \nand services with minimal friction and more \nbalanced distribution or sharing of the work87. \n \n \nThe wide deployment of Blockchain systems in \ncreative industries could help prevent \ninfringements or unauthorised uses, and overall \nenable more efficient, cost-effective and \npotentially fairer ways to compensate the owners \nand creators through pay-per-usage, \nmicropayments or automatic payment \ndistributions. Smart contracts could potentially \nmanage the whole process for instance \nregistering that a particular composition is owned \n                                                          \n84 See for example <http://open-music.org/blog/2016/6/6/why-\nus-why-now>  \n85 See for instance previous case of Global Repertoire \nDatabase (GRD), Klementina Milosic, \u2018GRD\u2019s Failure\u2019, Music \nBusiness Journal, 2015 <http://www.thembj.org/2015/08/grds-\nfailure/>. \n86 <https://ujomusic.com/> \n87 See <https://blog.ujomusic.com/welcome-back-\n1addcc06bcc6>  \n28 \n \n \nby specific parties such as writers, publishers or \nartists, registering the use or streaming of this \ncomposition, and then automatically executing \nhow the revenue is divided by the owner or \nowners of the copyright, and eventually \ndistributing seamlessly the payments. However, \nsmart contract technology is not at a mature \nstage where it can enable this type of agreements \nand automatic transactions across a multiparty \nnetwork88. \n \nAnother Blockchain application in this sector could \nbe the curation and management of metadata \nregarding any type of digital work. A distributed \nand verified database could host valuable \ninformation that today is mostly opaque except \nfor distributors, publishers and/or record labels, \nincluding how many times a song or a book was \nplayed, watched or read online, where or by which \nmeans it was bought, and even by whom. \nAdditional information potentially interesting from \nthe viewpoint of both creators and consumers \ncould be stored, such as instruments used in the \nproduction of a song, the place where it was \ncomposed, involved musicians, direct comments \nand/or feedback, and so on89. \n \nThe general expectation around the use of \nBlockchain is that it could support alternative \nbusiness models for digital works according to \nconditions set by their rights owners (either for \nfree under certain conditions, or at a price), and \nultimately change the dynamics between creators, \nauthors, users and distributors. It would imply \ndefining and experimenting with new incentives to \nconnect such a different set of stakeholders \nthrough greater transparency and sharing of data.  \n \nIt can be argued that open and trusted access to \ndata could create knowledge feedback loops \nbetween diverse stakeholders and foster ground-\nbreaking data-driven applications running not only \non Blockchain, but deploying AI, machine learning, \n                                                          \n88 George Howard, \u2018Salzburg Hack: A 12 Hour Sprint to Build a \nBlockchain Music Product\u2019, Open Music, 10 April 2018 \n<http://open-music.org/blog/2018/4/5/salzburg-hack-a-12-\nhour-sprint-to-build-a-blockchain-music-product>. \n89 Yessi Bello Perez, \u2018Imogen Heap: Decentralising the Music \nIndustry with Blockchain\u2019, 14 May 2016 \n<http://myceliaformusic.org/2016/05/14/imogen-heap-\ndecentralising-the-music-industry-with-blockchain/>. \ndata analytics and so on90. Yet, concerns remain \nfor instance about excessive commoditisation of \ndigital works in a future where all content is \ncatalogued, tracked and monetised. \n \nIn the long run, multi-stakeholder inclusive \ninnovation ecosystems could be running on a \nblockchain with no central authority, with multiple \nproviders depending on the function needed, and \nwith full interoperability between different \nservices91. It would be a modular approach for an \nopen and transparent meta-system running with \nindividual systems, not only adapted to the \nspecific problems they are designed to solve, but \nalso fully interoperable with each other by using \nopen standards and accessible data running on \nBlockchain systems, and in compliance with \nindependent certification and/or regulatory \nframeworks within a multi-stakeholder model. \n \n3.6. Energy \n \n \nBlockchain and other DLTs could be applied in the \nenergy sector when it comes for instance smart \ngrid and microgrid management, peer-to-peer \nenergy trading, micro transactions or payments, \ncarbon trading, energy production and \nconsumption monitoring, renewable energy \nprocurement, or electric vehicle charging. \n \nLeveraging on its feature of decentralisation, \nBlockchain could offer alternatives to long-\nstanding inefficiencies, vulnerabilities and losses \nof centralised solutions, mostly relying on mass \nproduction energy infrastructure. Blockchain allows \nfor multiple parties to coordinate among \n                                                          \n90 Andrew Dubber, \u2018Blockchain AI and beyond\u2019, 15 December \n2017 <http://musictechfest.net/blockchain-ai-and-beyond/>. \n91 Petter Ericson and others, # MTFLabs: Blockchain, 2016 \n<http://musictechfest.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2016/08/Blockchain-Whitepaper.pdf>. \n29 \n \n \nthemselves and execute transactions in an open \nand transparent way, still with differences \ndepending on the chosen type of public or private \narchitectures. Many are seeing it as a data \ncoordination and management infrastructure that \ncould boost the emergence of a decentralised \nenergy transaction and supply system92. \n \nOne possible application concerns the use of smart \ncontracts to manage automatically supply and \ndemand flows in near real-time and towards an \noptimal use of available energy93. When such \nsmart contracts are embedded in other \ntechnologies such as smart meters, smart devices \nand/or sensors, peer-to-peer trading scenarios \ncould be foreseen. Appliances, batteries, power \nplants, or any point in the grid could sell and buy \nenergy constantly and automatically toward a \nbalancing of the market. Several companies are \ntesting out Blockchain based trading platforms for \npower, natural gas and others that could connect \nlarge producers and factories, retailers and \neventually households94. \n \nbox06 = Use Case on Energy Platforms \n \nCo-founded by Rocky Mountain Institute and Grid \nSingularity and with a network of nearly 50 \naffiliates, Energy Web Foundation (EWF)95 is \ndeveloping an open-source and scalable \nBlockchain platform as a digital infrastructure \ndesigned for the energy sector\u2019s regulatory, \noperational, and market specificities. EWF affiliates \ncan build proprietary applications on top of the \nEWF\u2019s open-source Blockchain as a foundational \n                                                          \n92 Felix Hasse and others, Blockchain \u2013 an Opportunity for \nEnergy Producers and Consumers?, PwC Global Power & \nUtilities, 2016 \n<https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/assets/pwc-blockchain-\nopportunity-for-energy-producers-and-consumers.pdf>. \n93 Dan Brandon and others, \u2018Industrial Blockchain Platforms\u202f: \nAn Exercise in Use Case Development in the Energy Industry\u2019, \nInternational Journal of the Academic Business World, 2420.3 \n(2016) <http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781107415324.004>. \nTaneli Hukkinen and others, \u2018A Blockchain Application in \nEnergy\u2019, ETLA Reports, 71.71 (2017) \n<https://www.etla.fi/en/publications/a-blockchain-application-\nin-energy/>. \n94 Jesper Starn, \u2018Blockchain a Savior for Stretched Computers \nat Energy Trader\u2019, Bloomberg, 6 February 2018 \n<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-\n06/blockchain-a-savior-for-stretched-computers-at-energy-\ntrader>. \n95 <http://www.energyweb.org> \nbase layer, under a framework licence agreement \nbetween EWF and Parity Technologies. In its \ncurrent configuration, their platform is based on a \ndecentralised proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus \nmechanism with permissioned industry validators \nand a combination of on- and off-chain \ngovernance. Affiliates are testing it in use cases \nsuch as transactive energy, microgrids, community \nsolar, renewable energy procurement and trading, \nelectric vehicle charging, and demand response96. \nEWF is also developing several open-source \nsolutions such as \u2018EW Origin\u2019 which records \ninformation such as location, time, source type, \nand CO2 emissions and automatically tracks the \nownership of renewably generated electricity. \n \n \nDeployment of Blockchain systems could be \npotentially valuable for integration of renewable \nenergy sources, taking into account their volatile \nand intermittent generation or current inability of \nmarket prices to reflect the irregular flows of local \nenergy. As a decentralised coordination \ninfrastructure, Blockchain could support microgrid \nenergy markets in which individual customers \ncould trade locally produced renewable energy \n(using solar systems, wind turbines or other \nsmall-scale systems) directly with others in their \ncommunities with (near) real-time pricing97. \n \nSuch a peer-to-peer and local energy system could \nstrengthen the feasibility of transforming \nconsumers into 'prosumers'. By bringing production \nand consumption points closer, it could potentially \nreduce energy losses in the grid as it happens \ncurrently with long-distance transmission. The \noverall system could not only be more sustainable \ndue to a more efficient use of local resources, but \nalso more resilient (no single point of failure) to \npotential shortages98. \n \n                                                          \n96 See https://energyweb.org/2018/04/17/energy-web-\nfoundation-unveils-major-blockchain-milestones-at-event-\nhorizon/ \n97 Esther Mengelkamp and others, \u2018Designing Microgrid Energy \nMarkets.

Secure and near real-time monitoring of \nenergy consumption could also allow for more \nefficient metering and billing, even coupled with \nmicropayments via cryptocurrencies. \n \nShared records and tracking could lower costs and \nenhance transparency of all activities among \ndiverse stakeholders, and eventually facilitate \naccess to energy markets for smaller and medium \nplayers. Overall, secure access to information on a \nshared ledger about the origin, allocation and use \nof energy could be considered valuable in a new \nenergy system paradigm. Knowing more precisely \nwho\u2019s producing and consuming what type of \nenergy, at what times and through which means, \ncould be used for new local market and business \napproaches in the sector. \n \n3.7. Information Technologies  \n \n \nBlockchain and other DLTs could offer a number of \napplications in the information technologies sector, \nincluding for instance encrypted and peer-to-peer \ntelecommunications, mesh networking, \ndecentralised file systems and cloud storage, and \nother web services and applications. \n \nBlockchain\u2019s feature of digital keys could support \nauthentication in current telecommunications such \nas audio and video calling. Within encrypted Voice \nover Internet Protocols (VoIP), it could replace the \nneed for service providers or phone carriers to \nauthenticate callers and in the end bring forward \nopen, reliable and secure networks of \ncommunication no matter the users\u2019 locations99. \n \nFeatures of decentralisation and digital keys \noffered by Blockchain could also be leveraged in \nmesh networks, which are local decentralised \nsystem of nodes or wireless connection points \n(antennas, bridges, switches, or other devices) \nconnecting directly and cooperating with each \nother to efficiently route data. In a mesh network, \nparticipants share resources (internet connection, \nbattery power, cell phone) to run the network. For \nexample a limited number of participants \ndownloads files and then disperses to the others \nparticipants who don\u2019t need to be actually \nconnected to the internet. In a Blockchain \narchitecture, participants can be incentivised to run \nthe mesh network by getting rewards in tokens or \ncryptocurrencies. Also the identity of each \nparticipant could be securely managed in a \nBlockchain system, allowing for selective sharing \nof resources and data100. \n \nAnother application of Blockchain in the IT sector \nconcerns its potential integration with \ndecentralised file storage which means sharing \nfiles across a peer-to-peer network. Such \nintegration is usually built on BitTorrent protocols \ncurrently used for online sharing of large digital \nfiles (mostly video and audio). Instead of storing \nand/or accessing files through central servers, \ndecentralised storage protocols connect multiple \nusers to dispersed copies of files which are stored \nin other users' computers or devices. Other \nBlockchain's complementary integrations with \nother decentralised technologies concern peer-to-\npeer and distributed file systems. For example \nother techniques for timestamping, encrypting and \nsharing files could help to solve Blockchain's \nlimited capacity to host large sets of data. In such \ncases the files could be stored in a distributed \nnetwork and only its 'digital fingerprints' or \ncryptographic representations need to be inserted \nin a Blockchain ledger101. \n                                                          \n99 See for instance <https://encryptotel.com/> \n100 Robbie Abed, \u2018RightMesh Is Looking to Connect the World \nvia Blockchain\u2019, Huffington Post, 18 December 2017 \n<https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rightmesh-is-looking-\nto-connect-the-world-via-\nblockchain_us_5a38918ee4b0cebf48e9f6dd>. \n101 Juan Benet, \u2018IPFS White Paper: Content Addressed, \nVersioned, P2P File System (Draft 3)\u2019, 2014 \n<http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3561>. \n31 \n \n \n \nbox07 = Use Case on Cloud Storage  \n \nStorj102 offers a decentralised and end-to-end \nencrypted cloud storage platform that uses \nBlockchain's ledger, public/private keys, and \ncryptographic hash functions for security purposes. \nA user can encrypt a file using its keys and then \nthe file is divided in smaller pieces called 'shards'. \nThese pieces are sent to a decentralised network \nof individual computers which only store a piece of \nthe original file. To recall it, the original user uses \nits private key to locate it and all the others send \nback the pieces to rebuild the file. The network is \nrun by nodes or 'farmers' which rent out their extra \nhard drive space in return for Storj tokens. It's \nsimilar to cryptocurrency mining as it occurs in \nProof-of-Work consensus mechanism in Bitcoin or \nEthereum, in which individual computers are \nverifying transactions by solving mathematical \npuzzles. Storj has a community of around 20.000 \nusers (uploaders) and 19.000 farmers (storage \nproviders). \n \n \nDecentralised architectures such as Blockchain \nand others are increasingly considered as \nalternatives to centralised platforms and \nassociated problems of user privacy, data control \nand vulnerability to security breaches. Most of \ncurrent applications and services store user data in \ncentral servers and/or use third parties to manage \nkeys and certificate based authentication, which \nthen become privileged targets for attacks.  \n \nBlockchain could be applied in decentralised web \napplications103 for domain names, identity and \nstorage, in which users control where their data is \nkept (in their own computers or specific cloud \nservers) and how it's accessed. For example, all \ndata generated by the users could be stored \nlocally in their computers or devices, and then \nencrypted for backup copies in cloud storage \n                                                          \n102 <https://storj.io/index.html> \n103 Laura Shin, \u2018Blockstack Unveils A Browser For The \nDecentralized Web\u2019, Forbes, 23 May 2017 \n<https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/05/23/blockstac\nk-unveils-a-browser-for-the-decentralized-\nweb/#3272b60871cd>. \nsystems if needed104. Users would only share a \nrestricted profile or part of the data relevant to the \nrequested access for applications and services, \nespecially if the latter were also built on top of \ndecentralised platforms. Access to the data could \nalso be revoked at any time, thus allowing for full \ndata portability between services. In such cases, a \nBlockchain system would allow individuals to have \na universal identity system based on digital keys \ngenerated on their own devices.  \n \nOther cross-sectoral applications of Blockchain in \nthe IT sector include for instance launching \nsatellite-enabled Blockchain systems. These \nsystems would be independent of satellite \nnetworks now mostly controlled by governments, \ncontractors, and major commercial players. Such \nopen source and decentralised systems could be \nused to run Blockchain applications in space at a \nlower cost, which could help its industrial adoption \nand widespread experimentation\n105\n. They could \nalso be used to run distributed networks for \ncryptocurrencies, making them fully accessible \nanywhere and anytime, even in places with poor \nor expensive Internet connectivity\n106\n.  \n \n3.8.

As an \nencrypted and immutable digital record, a \nblockchain could register the set of characteristics \nassociated to a product, such as physical qualities, \ndesign specifications, used materials, ownership, \nplace of manufacture, maintenance history, \ncertifications or warranties. If the products are \nmonitored via IoT devices or sensors along the \nwhole process, Blockchain could also register \ninformation on location, availability, or status.  \n \nThis record would support in fact the digital \nrepresentation of any physical or digital product, \nthat is, in a certain sense a 'digital twin' or digital \nproduct memory encompassing all relevant data \nto be accessed and used through the whole \nchain107. Any changes to the product made by \ninvolved parties would be added, timestamped \nand tracked on a blockchain. This updated record \nwould be available to everyone no matter their \nlocation with the proper or necessary identity \ncredentials. \n \nBlockchain\u2019s decentralised feature could also be \nuseful in production scenarios using additive \nmanufacturing or 3D printing. Digital files could \nbe easily transmitted across a number of parties \nand geographical sites, from the original \ndesigners to the production floors of a factory. Its \nencryption mechanisms would also guarantee \nauthentication of such files. Overall Blockchain \ncould serve as the backbone and security layer for \ndigital data flows for the design, modelling, \n                                                          \n107 Carsten Stocker, \u2018Implementing First Industry 4.0 Use Cases \nwith DAG Tangle \u2014 Machine Tagging for Digital Twins\u2019, Medium, \n24 January 2017 \n<https://medium.com/@cstoecker/implementing-first-industry-\n4-0-use-cases-with-iota-dag-tangle-machine-tagging-for-\ndigital-twins-baf1943c499d>. \nproduction, validation, use and monitoring of 3D \nmanufactured parts108. \n \nDigital supply chain solutions for 3D printing are \nbeing tested within the trends of Industry 4.0109. \nBlockchain could support more lean \nmanufacturing processes based on point-of-use \nand time-of-need supply chains, that is, on \navailability of parts when and where they are \nneeded. A company could purchase a digital file \nand use a blockchain to transfer the file and also \nto verify the 3D printing vendor and 3D printing \nmachines which are closer to the final place of \nproduction or assembly. Transactions including \norders and payments between companies are \nautomatically executed and completed through \nsmart contracts which also maintain logs of \nauthorised uses of an asset110. \n \nIn the future, smart contracts could eventually \nlocate the most appropriate production facilities \nand negotiate the terms autonomously based on \navailability, price, quality, delivery or location. \nSuch processes are expected not only to save \ninventory, import and logistic costs, but also lead \nto a decrease of ecological footprints and \nultimately boost self-sufficient local economies. \n \nbox08 = Use Case on 3D Printing  \n \nThe Genesis of Things project111 is developing an \nopen secure platform to decentralise industrial \nmanufacturing, with the goals of reducing \ninventory costs and lead times, increasing \nproduction efficiency and improving product life \ncycle management. The proposed model would \nallow for companies to scan and/or access 3D \ndesigns of spare parts for example, securely their \n                                                          \n108 Stuart Strouton, Mark Vitale and Jason Killmeyer, 3D \nOpportunity for Blockchain: Additive Manufacturing Links the \nDigital Thread, 2016 \n<https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/us/articles/32\n55_3D-opportunity_blockchain/DUP_3D-\nopportunity_blockchain.pdf>. \n109 See <http://www.moog.com/news/corporate-press-\nreleases/2018/STAerospaceCollaborate3DPrinting.html> and \n<https://www.automationworld.com/blockchain-coming-\nmanufacturing>  \n110 Vincent Dieterich and others, Application of Blockchain \nTechnology in the Manufacturing Industry, Frankfurt School \nBlockchain Center, 2017 <http://explore-\nip.com/2017_Blockchain-Technology-in-Manufacturing.pdf>. \n111 <http://www.genesisofthings.com/> \n33 \n \n \ntransfer and produce them on demand in 3D \nprinters at locations close to their operation and \nmaintenance centres. Smart contracts could \neventually be used to select, track and automate \nany type of transaction, including permissions of \naccess, logistics procedures, associated rights and \nexecution of payments. In a proof-of-concept or \ndemonstrator for a Blockchain based shared 3D \nprinting factory, some of the involved companies \n(Cognizant, innogy and EOS GmbH Electro Optical \nSystems) tested end-to-end encryption of 3D print \nfiles to produce titanium cufflinks with a unique ID \nand digital product memory (from their creation to \ntheir transmission and fabrication at a 3D printer). \n \n \nWithin scenarios of additive and subtractive \nmanufacturing, Blockchain serves as a tamper-\nproof record of ownership of digital files, and in \nthe end could help to prevent unauthorised uses, \nthefts and infringements. It could improve \nprocesses of intellectual property management \nsuch as patents, trademarks or design rights, \nalong a long distributed network of creators, \nproviders, sellers, manufacturers and distributors. \nBlockchain could also store the digital identity of \neach manufactured part via embedded serials and \nidentifiers, and thus provide proof of compliance \nwith mandatory warranties, licences and \nstandards in their production, installation and \nmaintenance. \n \nIn more future-oriented scenarios, Blockchain \ncould usher profound changes in manufacturing \nprocesses towards decentralised and autonomous \nsmart production\n112\n. For instance, such \ntechnologies could create more trusted and \nflexible relationships between manufacturers, \nsuppliers and customers in a context of open and \ndigitalised ecosystems, particularly for niche \nplayers such as micro-factories or small service \nproviders. It would be mostly a data-driven \necosystem as the basis for potential new business \nmodels, which could be able to leverage on \navailable real-time data about source raw \n                                                          \n112 Burkhard Blechschmidt and Carsten St\u00f6cker, How \nBlockchain Can Slash the Manufacturing \u2018Trust Tax\u2019, Cognizant, \n2016 <https://www.cognizant.com/whitepapers/how-\nblockchain-can-slash-the-manufacturing-trust-tax-\ncodex2279.pdf>. \nmaterials, best manufacturers, characteristics and \nlocation of products, and/or quality controls and \nassurances. \n \n3.9. Natural Resources  \n \n \nBlockchain and other DLTs could have potential \napplications within activities of extraction and \ncollection of natural resources such as farming, \nfishing or mining, for example when it comes to \ndata monitoring of crops and extraction \nprocesses, management of contractual \nobligations, trading of commodities, land and \nproperty registry, resource tracking, and \nsustainability measurement and management. \n \nA Blockchain system could offer a shared and \nimmutable record for data collected in real-time \nwith IoT sensors and handheld devices for \ninstance by farmers. Information about the status \nof the crop like salt and sugar content, pH levels, \nlocation and level growth, could help farmers to \nbetter plan when to harvest and share this \ninformation with buyers and distributors. Data \nsharing with multiple parties could help improve \nmanagement of stocks, transportation and \ndelivery, that is, reduce costs, shortages, surplus \nand overall inefficiencies along the whole chain113. \n \nBy allowing encrypted but shared access to the \nrecord in a more open or restricted way \n(depending on the architecture), a blockchain \ncould help involved parties to keep track of all \ntransactions and contractual obligations. Smart \ncontracts could be used to implement and execute \noperations automatically among buyers, suppliers \nand other stakeholders, by setting up conditions \n                                                          \n113 Peter Newman, \u2018This Startup Is Pairing the Blockchain with \nFarming\u2019, Business Insider UK, 10 November 2017 \n<http://uk.businessinsider.com/ripe-blockchain-farming-\nstartup-2017-11?r=US&IR=T>. \n34 \n \n \nsuch as selling and buying prices, insurances, \nprofit distribution, compliance with necessary \ncertifications, and so on. It could potentially \nminimise fraud and introduce more transparency \nand accountability between often distant parties.  \n \nAccess to a shared record of data and possible \nexecution of operations via smart contracts could \nalso be used for actual trading of agricultural \ncommodities114. Delays related to manual checks \nand paper documentation could be greatly \nreduced if up-to-date digital data was fully \navailable, including contracts, letters of credit, or \ncertifications. \n \nIn other cases, Blockchain could even allow for \nalternative ownership, governance and distribution \nmodels, particularly for community-supported \nagriculture or small producers. Proof and transfer \nof ownership or co-ownership could be supported \nby an encrypted and unique registry. Tokens \nrepresenting shares of harvested crops could be \ndistributed, bought or sold among participants, or \neven represent votes for decision-making and \noperational processes within organisations or \ncompanies. Such models could improve overall \nresource management by smaller and local \nproducers and in the end support self-sufficient \nlocal economies.  \n \nbox09 = Use Case on Land Registry  \n \nStartups in Kenya and Ghana are developing \nBlockchain based digital records for land \nownership and transfer, which could translate into \nmore transparency for all parties, including \nfarmers, governments, banks, brokers, buyers and \nsellers115. The main idea is to create a secure and \ntamper proof record to tackle persistent problems \nof duplicated or forged documents, corruption, \nbribes and disputes over land or property. One of \n                                                          \n114 Andy Hoffman and Ruben Munsterman, \u2018Dreyfus Teams \nWith Banks for First Agriculture Blockchain Trade\u2019, Bloomberg, \n22 January 2018 \n<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-\n22/dreyfus-teams-with-banks-for-first-agriculture-blockchain-\ntrade>. \n115 Kevin Mwanza and Henry Wilkins, \u2018African Startups Bet on \nBlockchain to Tackle Land Fraud\u2019, Reuters, 16 February 2018 \n<https://www.reuters.com/article/us-africa-landrights-\nblockchain/african-startups-bet-on-blockchain-to-tackle-land-\nfraud-idUSKCN1G00YK>. \nthe most immediate benefits would be the formal \nacknowledgement of land titles informally owned \nby communities or through oral agreements \nbetween subsistence farmers and land-owners. \nRegistering land titles or business licences on a \nblockchain could also enable individuals and \nfamilies to request loans and mortgages to banks, \nand overall to conduct transactions without the \ndirect presence of lawyers, notaries or government \nofficials. Challenges may arise from the reluctance \nof governments and state agencies to support the \ndevelopment and open access of Blockchain \nbased registries, to recognise its legitimacy or to \nuse them to complement state records. Also any \nregistration effort would imply on the ground \nverification with associated high costs and \npotential disputes. For instance surveyors would \nneed to interview farmers, neighbours and chiefs \nin specific communities to come to shared \nagreements when no previous written registry of \nland rights is available. \n \n \nAs previously seen in other sectors, Blockchain \narchitectures are also increasingly being deployed \nfor ascertaining origin or provenance of food, \nproducts and materials within global supply chains. \nSuch architectures could be used for tracking and \ncertification of mineral supply for batteries in cell \nphones, computers and electric cars, in order to \nprevent further use of minerals extracted in \nconflict zones where profits are fuelled to war \nefforts ('conflict minerals'), or from companies \nusing child labour or with known record of human \nrights violations. Minerals produced by certified \nminers or companies would be embedded with a \ndigital tag containing information about their \ncharacteristics, date and time, and then encrypted \non a Blockchain based immutable record. At every \nstage, from the miner to the trader, smelter and \nbuyer, the transactions would be recorded and \nauthenticated by involved or relevant parties116. \n \nResource tracking and certification via a \nblockchain could be at the core of emerging \n                                                          \n116 Barbara Lewis, \u2018Blockchain to Track Congo\u2019s Cobalt from \nMine to Mobile\u2019, Reuters, 2 February 2018 \n<https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mining-blockchain-\ncobalt/blockchain-to-track-congos-cobalt-from-mine-to-\nmobile-idUSKBN1FM0Y2>. \n35 \n \n \nsolutions aligned with sustainable development \ngoals or circular economy models117. From carbon \nemissions and material recycling, to monitoring \nand authentication of natural resources, a tamper \nproof record of product data could help regulatory \ncouncils, governments and certification bodies to \nperform sustainability measurement and \nmanagement processes. For instance verifying \ntimber or forest products in a value chain could be \nimproved by using a more reliable and immutable \ndigital traceability system118. Still, this system \nwould need to put in place adequate procedures \nfor entering and verifying data inputs from \ndifferent stakeholders, which could imply \ncertification schemes or guidelines defined within \na distributed network of validators. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n117 Benedikt Christian Eikmanns, Blockchain\u202f: Proposition of a \nNew and Sustainable Macroeconomic System, 2018 \n<http://www.explore-ip.com/2018_Blockchain-and-\nSustainability.pdf>.  \n118 Boris Dudder and Omri Ross, \u2018Timber Tracking: Reducing \nComplexity of Due Diligence by Using Blockchain Technology \n(Position Paper)\u2019, SSRN, 2017 \n<https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID3015219_c\node1324274.pdf?abstractid=3015219&mirid=1>. \n\n\n38 \n \n \n4. Prototyping for Policy \n \n4.1 #Blockchain4EU in a Policy Lab context \n \nPolicy Labs are a new generation of material and \nconceptual spaces devoted to opening up public \npolicies to inter and transdisciplinary innovation, \nand connect them with experimental, \nparticipatory, and stakeholder-centric frameworks. \nTheir ways of operating are often oriented \ntowards setting up extended partnerships with a \nwide diversity of actors and expand the pool of \n\u2018usual suspects\u2019 called into play, thus standing as \nunique connectors between public, private and \nhybrid sectors. Existing in and around \ngovernments and other public bodies, at local and \nregional, national, or supranational levels, Labs \nseek to disrupt the most traditional ways of \nproviding robust evidence based advice for policy, \nand consequentially change policy making \nitself119.  \n \nDeveloped within the EU Policy Lab of the Joint \nResearch Centre, the #Blockchain4EU project was \ninitiated with the same mindset. Beyond \nconventional desk research, and qualitative \nanalysis that combined open-ended interviews, \nsemi-structured surveys, and short duration multi-\nsited ethnographic explorations, we also strived \nfor more innovative pathways to create and \ndeliver key outputs for policy advice. Mixing \nScience and Technology Studies, with a toolbox \nfilled with theoretical and practical insights from \nother fields, as Foresight and Horizon Scanning, \nBehavioural Insights, or Participatory and Critical \nDesign, from day one we were deeply invested in \npushing the frontiers of what\u2019s common practice \nin policy when looking into new technologies.  \n \nThe main route through which we pursued this \nwas based on the engagement of an extensive \nand diverse array of stakeholders in the \n                                                          \n119 Lucy Kimbell and Jocelyn Bailey, \u2018Prototyping and the New \nSpirit of Policy-Making\u2019, CoDesign, 13.3 (2017), 214\u201326. \nChristian Bason, Leading Public Sector Innovation: Co-Creating \nfor a Better Society (Bristol: Policy Press, 2010).

And this was based on the \naggregation of several methodological \nframeworks throughout more than six months, \nfrom concept to physical artefact. \n \n4.2. Between Stakeholder Engagement and \nCo-creation \n \nAfter embarking on exploratory research based on \nthe mix between desk and qualitative research \nmentioned above, we devised a series of three co-\ncreation workshops that could help us to better \nsteer methodologically this endeavour. This \nallowed us to bring into the mix not only key \nindividual and collective stakeholders in the \nBlockchain space on our first and second \nworkshops, but also, on our third workshop, \nstakeholders who not being directly involved with \nBlockchain and other DLTs, might be affected its \npotential developments in the near future, and \neven become interested in entering the space by \nacquiring or developing their own solutions. \n \nThe first workshop took place on July 2017120, \naimed at mapping multiple existent and \nforeseeable Blockchain spaces on present and \nfuture challenges and opportunities, and \nespecially considering the policy, economic, social, \ntechnological, legal and environmental dimensions \nof such challenges and opportunities. Based on a \npurposive sampling technique, participants were \nselected from an extensive pool of stakeholders \nto act as a snapshot of the current Blockchain \necosystem in industrial and non-financial sectors. \nThe group included technical experts, developers \nand scientists, social, economic, ethical and legal \nresearchers, entrepreneurs and investors, business \nand labour representatives, and policy actors at \nlocal, national and EU levels, highly interested or \nalready engaged with Blockchain and other DLT \napplications. Our key outputs were the mapping \nand discussion of collective visions that could \ninform policy on present and future possibilities of \n                                                          \n120 <https://blogs.ec.europa.eu/eupolicylab/first-workshop-of-\nblockchain4eu-blockchain-for-industrial-transformations/> \n39 \n \n \nblockchain applications, as well as on core factors \nthat could support or hamper their development \nand uptake.  \n \nAnd in March 2018121 we had our third and final \nworkshop centred on a broad spectrum discussion \non policy strategies for digitisation of industry and \nbusinesses, with particular focus on technology \nadoption and SME innovation. Again based on a \npurposive sample, participants were mainly drawn \nfrom a group of stakeholders at the forefront of \nEU digitization and SME innovation, including \nindustry, startups and SME representatives, \nEuropean networks or initiatives, think tanks and \nbusiness consultants in the field, and \nintergovernmental and international organisations. \nOur key goals now were to gain a better \nunderstanding of how Blockchain and other DLTs \ncould fit in present and future digitisation \nlandscapes on the ground, and how these \ntechnologies might affect or impact different \nactors operating in more established industrial \nand non-financial sectors. \n \nBut the centre of our process was the second \nworkshop, which took place on November 2017 \nthroughout two days at FabLab Brussels of \nErasmusschogeschool, and where emphasis was \nfully placed on the material exploration of near \nfuture scenarios of creation, production, \ndistribution and use of Blockchain and other DLT \napplications in previously selected sectors. We \nkick-started this workshop based on what had \nbeen amassed so far through research, but most \ncrucially, building upon core outputs of the first \nworkshop. As in the entire project, we also \ncombined Science and Technology Studies with \nother fields, but full attention was given here to \nparticipatory, generative and speculative design \nmethods to help us deliver the intended results122.  \n \n                                                          \n121 <https://blogs.ec.europa.eu/eupolicylab/third-workshop-of-\nblockchain4eu-blockchain-for-industrial-transformations/> \n122 E.B.\u2010N.

And we invited not only \nlead designers to work with us on each prototype, \nbefore, during and after the workshop, but also \ntechnical and industry stakeholders, along with \nsocial and economic researchers, to stimulate \ndiscussions in more encompassing and \ninterdisciplinary ways.  \n \nThe main challenge was to build artefacts that \ncould simultaneously serve two main goals. First, \nto inform or agitate current views on Blockchain, \nnot only of policy makers at EU, national and local \nlevels, but also of traditional industrial and \nbusiness stakeholders. And second, to help frame \nBlockchain applications according to the EU \nIndustrial Policy Strategy123, with special focus on \nSMEs and their innovation and competitiveness, \nbut also to the shaping of options for better \nfunding, regulatory, and other broader policy \nresponses, in the remit of the European \nCommission service behind the request for the \n#Blockchain4EU research project, DG GROW, the \nDirectorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, \nEntrepreneurship & SMEs. \n \n4.3. From Making to Policy Making \n \nOur prototyping developments were never \nassumed as mere secondary streams throughout \nthe project, but as core research components that \nwould increase the range of our forward looking \nresearch while providing better ways to \ncommunicate about Blockchain. Their existence \nran both in parallel and perpendicular to all of our \nother activities, becoming a critical space to \nexpand our understanding of blockchain and its \npotential, through distinct moments of co-creation \nmassively attached to wide stakeholder \nengagement efforts.  \n \nWhen the term prototyping is used within policy \ncontexts, it usually means the piloting and testing \nof services before implementation or scaling up \nstages. This might happen at multiple phases of a \n                                                          \n123 See < https://ec.europa.eu/commission/news/new-\nindustrial-policy-strategy-2017-sep-18_en>  \n40 \n \n \nresearch project or experimental intervention \nembedded in one or more public or hybrid sectors. \nIt often involves creations going from quick and \ncheap wireframing websites or low-fidelity mock-\nups, to fully fledged services nearly ready for \ndeployment. And actors such as regular citizens, \npublic officers, technical experts, service providers \nor third party stakeholders are usually called in to \ntrial such prototypes through role playing, user \njourneys, contextual mappings, and other \nadequate methodologies, towards fine tuning and \npossible iterations, and a search for the best \npossible evidence on how to move plausible \nproofs-of-concept into working solutions124. \n \nBut there are also other uses for prototyping in \npolicy, even if sometimes less used or tested in \ngovernment or public sector organisations, such \nas the creation of fictional artefacts meant to \ntrigger forward looking discussions into the \npossibilities of yet to be fully fledged realities. \nConnected with more traditional foresight \napproaches, critical, speculative and fiction design \nframeworks came to the forefront in this project. \nThese frameworks offer us ways through which \nwe do not predict futures, as if creating maps for \ntomorrow, but build instead compasses for the \nyears to come. They help us open up discussions \nthat act as catalysts for better informed decisions \non the preferred directions to build what\u2019s next125. \nAnd the material outputs produced within them \nbecome learning devices attached to imaginative \nleaps, rather than monolithic representations of \ntomorrow which are never adequate for the \nessential questioning of potential policy realities \nto come126. \n \nPrimary audiences for the prototypes are policy \nmakers and political agents at EU, national and \nlocal levels, already engaged, potentially \ninterested in dealing with, or working in sectors \n                                                          \n124 Emma Blomkamp, \u2018The Promise of Co\u2010Design for Public \nPolicy\u2019, Australian Journal of Public Administration, 2018 \n<https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8500.12310>.

Blockchain and Design Fictions  \n \nOne of the questions we were often asked was: \nwhy the effort of developing fictional artefacts \nand systems in the Blockchain space, and just not \nproceed to analyse and showcase what is already \nout there? Multiple answers are possible here. We \nlooked indeed into several of these existent \napplications and the companies behind them \nthroughout the whole project, detailing some in \nprevious chapters, and engaging as many as \npossible in stakeholder engagement initiatives as \nthe prototypes co-creation. And given this is a \nresearch for policy project based on independent \nevidence within a particular institutional context, it \nwould always be sensitive to pick flagship players \nor applications considering the nascent and \nuncertainty of both technological and market \nfields. Nevertheless, the main and ultimate \nexplanation is that in producing prototypes for \npolicy we have different goals than technical or \ncommercial driven ventures, and we need this \ndifferentiation.  \n \nPrototypes can be a more understandable and \ncompelling way to explain how something might \nwork127. In prototyping and creating design fictions \non top of Blockchain, we address different issues \nand ask different questions from those who have \ntheir resources placed on functionality and \nintricate proofs of concept, stake or others. For \ninstance, we were always concerned about the \ncreation of prototypes that would not merely \naddress essential distributed ledger features, as \nimmutability, time-stamping, decentralisation or \nautomation, but were also capable of reflecting \nwithin their conceptual and material choices a \ncomprehensive overview on relevant policy, \n                                                          \n127 Vasant Chari, \u2018On Prototyping and Putting Something out \nThere...\u2019, UK Policy Lab Blog, July <2017>. \n41 \n \n \neconomic, social, technological, legal and \nenvironmental questions surrounding Blockchain. \nWhat is more, all five prototypes had to tackle not \nthe need to use this particular technology, but \nproblems in each industrial sector where \nBlockchain and other DLTs could be tested and \napplied in search for solutions. \n \nOn a higher level, each prototype had to be able \nto illustrate what could be a potential application \nin its respective use case, preferably taking into \naccount future adoption or upscaling scenarios, \nand showcasing properties inherent to what most \npeople would consider a blockchain based \napplication. But on a lower level, our main interest \nwas that each prototype could represent an \naccessible entry point for the subject at hand, \nBlockchain and other DLTs in industrial and non-\nfinancial sectors. Their existence was always \nmeant to allow non experts to understand what \nthey do, how do they work, how are they going to \naddress, solve or pose specific problems, in what \nkind of scenario would they exist, who would be \nthe actors involved, etc. \n \n4.5. Collaborative Productions \n \nThe second workshop was in fact the central point \nof co-creation for the prototypes. Starting with the \nnine sectors we had previously selected to be \ncentral in our overall forward-looking research, we \nthen narrowed them down to five where the \nprototypes would fit. We started our formulation \nwith a mix between ample sectors, such as \nenergy, use cases such as supply chains, and even \ngeneral blockchain functions, such as data \nauthentication and certification. But we ended up \nframing the final prototypes in the larger energy, \ntransports and logistics, creative industries, \nadvanced manufacturing and health sectors. We \nconsidered these sectors to be not only more \nadequate for the development of speculative \nprototypes for policy, but also sectors where the \nmaturity or visibility of already existing \napplications would make it simpler to connect our \ndesign fictions with real life scenarios considering \nthe heterogeneous audiences who could later \ninteract with them. \n \nEach sector was assigned to five interdisciplinary \ngroups composed by five participants. As \nmentioned above, all these groups included \ndesigners, technical and industry expert \nstakeholders, and social and economic \nresearchers. Moreover, policy makers from \ndifferent European Commission services briefly \njoined each group in the first workshop morning to \nprovide input on policy files potentially relevant to \ntheir sector. There were always two designers \nresponsible to co-lead the process during the \nworkshop in each of the groups. These designers \nworked previously with the EU Policy Lab in the \npreparation of the workshop, and were also \ninvited to remotely finalize the prototypes in the \nfollowing months, in connection with other \nmembers of their group. \n \nWe strived for all participants to have an equal \nsay in their group\u2019s prototype development during \nand after the workshop. As such we asked \neveryone to contribute to all material and \nconceptual prototyping activities, aiming at a \ncollective vision of what a final prototype will be, \ndeciding on its specifications and functions,  and \ninsuring the prototype was built by reflecting \nongoing and foreseeable debates on Blockchain \nand other DLTs. \n \nWe started by offering multiple ideas on potential \nuse cases, applications and topics for the \nconceptual and material developments of each \ngroup, as well as defining a few boundaries on \nfeasibility given all groups had to produce a first \nmaterially tangible and interactive version of their \nprototype at the end of the workshop.  But we left \nit open to their criteria where to take the \nprototype and what kind of Blockchain properties \nand functions it should demonstrate or simulate. \nThe only major request we had was for each \ngroup to always address policy, economic, social, \ntechnological, legal and environmental questions \nin the conceptualization and design of their \nprototype, and embed them as much as possible \nin its materialization processes.  \n \nThe set of questions and topics inside each \ndimension was drawn from our desk research, our \nqualitative explorations, and the first stakeholder \nworkshop. It was then given to all groups at the \nstart of the workshop. Groups could choose to \ndefine and address new questions and topics \ninside each dimension or reformulate those \n42 \n \n \nprovided, but they all had to consider at least four \ndimensions within their prototype development. \n \nAll prototypes had to have a first version at the \nend of the workshop, and a final version to be \nfinalized after the workshop by the lead designers \nof each group with inputs from other participants. \nNo version needed to be fully functional or \ndemonstrate real Blockchain or other DLT \nfunctions, however, provided they were able to \nsimulate their operations in alternative ways and \nbe easily identifiable with the technology in \nquestion. \n \nFirst prototypes versions were mainly low fidelity \nthree dimensional mock-ups with a limited \nnumber of core components and functionalities \nalready mapped. They were mainly the result of \ninterdisciplinary collaborative process inside each \ngroup, and reflected the diversity of inputs made \npossible by the combination of design, technical, \nindustrial and social and economic knowledge \nbrought to the table by all group members. \n \nFinal versions, however, were requested to have \nmaterially tangible and interactive existences, that \nis, three dimensional forms able to illustrate main \nfunctions, while being equally responsive to \nexternal inputs. There were no predefined \nlimitations regarding materials, volumetric or \noperational procedures. These versions just had to \nbe built with a solid internal structure, resistant \nexternal materials, based on low power \nrequirements to function over significant periods \nof time, be simple to carry and assemble and \ndisassemble when required, easy to operate by \nlay people, and accessible to the largest possible \nnumber of users and audiences.  \n \nAll prototypes and respective design and coding \nelements will be made available by the EU Policy \nLab of the Joint Research Centre to the general \npublic, under EU Public Licence (EUPL)128, and \nwhere not applicable under a Creative Commons \nAttribution-Share Alike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA \n4.0)129.

Meet the Prototypes! \n \nThe five prototypes that will be presented in the \nfollowing pages are not an end in any possible \nway. They are the beginning of a conversation \nthat we hope can be extensive, complex, \nmultifaceted and challenging.  \n \nIn the following pages are information teasers for \nphysical objects, with a hint of the questions we \nhope all of them will be able to provoke. Each \ngroup created and provide additional information \nand outputs about their prototypes, which are \navailable in the EU Policy Lab blog, along with \nother #Blockchain4EU research and \ncommunication materials.  \n \nWe foresee these prototypes as a step forward \nconsidering present and future discussions about \nBlockchain and other DLTs. But the best way to \nunderstand what they are, what challenges and \nopportunities they might pose in their respective \nsectors, and above all what type of discussions \nthey can trigger at policy, economic, social, \ntechnical, legal or environmental levels, is still, \nand always will be to interact with them. Having \nthe physical prototypes in front, being able to \npush buttons, play with the apps, get hold of what \neach group produced as background information, \nor even get in touch with those who helped us co-\ncreate such artefacts in order to learn more about \ntheir processes, is the most adequate way to \nmake the best of what was built.  \n \nBeyond their public presentation in the \n#Blockchain4EU final event, the five prototypes \nwill be used later for research purposes in the \nscope of future activities developed by the Joint \nResearch Centre, not only in the field of \ndistributed ledger technologies or other \ndecentralised networks, but also in policy \ninnovation domains considering new \n                                                          \n130 <https://www.jelurida.com/> \n131 < https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0> \n43 \n \n \nmethodological approaches and transdisciplinary \ntoolboxes, from Science and Technology Studies, \nto Foresight and Horizon Scanning, Behavioural \nInsights and Design for Policy. But most crucially, \nthe prototypes will be used by DG GROW, other \nEuropean Commission DGs, and other EU \ninstitutions to trigger and stimulate debates in \nseveral other instances considering Blockchain \nand other DLTs within EU policy, industrial and \nbusiness contexts. We wish to invite everyone in \nadvance to join us in such an endeavour. \n \nFor now, meet Gigbliss in the energy sector, \nBloodchain in transports and logistics, Gossip \nChain in creative industries sector, Vantage Point \nin advanced manufacturing, and Care AI in health. \n  \nBALANCE Display showing energy \nmanagement and charging level\nAUTO Display showing power \navailability and connection settings\n#Energy #IoT #Consumption #EnergyTrading #Automation #SmartStorage #SmartContracts #SmartGrids\nGigbliss is an IoT suite that o\ufb00ers three models of the \nsame hairdryer, AUTO, BALANCE and PLUS, linked to \nthree distinct economic models of energy \nconsumption, management and trading. \nGigbliss\nPLUS Display showing \nmarket trading credits \nand energy storage\n#Energy #IoT #Consumption #EnergyTrading #Automation #SmartStorage #SmartContracts #SmartGrids\nAUTO Model _\nis o\ufb00ered for free but works only automatically \nat o\ufb00-peak times. /\n/ It is linked to a smart contract that enables \nusers to dry their hair without energy costs until \ntheir allocated time period ends.\nBALANCE Model _\nlets consumers use it when energy prices are \nmarked low. / \n/ A smart contract manages it and minimises \nenergy costs by automating the trade of stored \nenergy when the hairdryer is not being used.\nPLUS Model _ \nallows usage on low energy costs at all times, \nautomatically \ufb01nding the best energy deals. /\n/ It also monetises itself by letting users choose \nwhen to buy or sell energy, or negotiating directly \nwith the grid.\n46 \n \n \n \nGigbliss \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe point of departure for Gigbliss was the energy \nsector. The group behind this prototype was \ncomposed by Chris Speed (University of \nEdinburgh) and Larissa Pschetz (University of \nEdinburgh) as lead designers, Marco Sachy \n(Dyne.org), Michael R\u00fcther (Spherity GmbH) and \nJuri Mattila (ETLA / Research Institute of the \nFinnish Economy) as expert stakeholders, and Rory \nGianni (University of Edinburgh), Katherine Snow \n(Povo design) and Linda Ma (Povo design) in \nsupport to the prototype production. \n \n \nfig.03 = Gigbliss BALANCE simulated heating system  \n \nThe work started with the notion of smart \ndomestic appliances attached to different levels \nof control offered to consumers based upon the \ncost of \u2018instant access\u2019 energy.  \n \nThe initial assumptions for a prototype were that \ntraditional domestic products tend toward an on \ndemand model of energy in which the consumer \nhas complete control of when they what energy \nfor an appliance to work. Using blockchain \ntechnology to support smart energy balancing \ncontracts, the group then progressed on top of \nthree categories that challenged this status quo \nand could gradually move domestic appliances \nfrom human control to machine control on the \nsociotechnical intersection of DLTs with IoT. \n \nBeyond what was deemed as an H2m model \n(Human to machine, with main control by the \nhuman agent) in which traditional appliances \nusually have a button or interface that allows the \nconsumer to turn it on and use it at will, new \nmodels were discussed to develop IoT products \nlinked to blockchain systems, such as h2M (human \nto Machine, with main control by the machine \nagent), m2M (machine to Machine, with main \ncontrol by the second machine agent) and M2M \n(Machine to Machine, with distributed control \nbetween both machine agents). \n \nIn the first model, h2M, buttons on devices could \nwork to signal that a consumer would like to \ninitiate the operation of a device. However the \ndevice would delay being turned on until it found \nthe best energy price by trading on the open \nenergy market according to the balancing of \nenergy demand. This would cause a delay in the \nuser getting their device to function, but it would \nguarantee lower energy costs through the \nexecution of smart contract linked to the product\u2019s \noperations. \n \nIn the second model, m2M, there would be no \nbuttons and instead products would operate once \na day at a time when they were able to get the \nbest possible price for energy. This would require \nconsumers to remain highly alert to the sound of \nm2H hairdryers turning on to have the possibility \nof using them, or prepare appliances such as \nwashing machines in advance, filling them with \nclothes and detergent to function when the price \nbecomes adequate. \n \nThe third, M2M, would imply funding the appliance \nenergy costs through tokenisation schemes, an \nentirely autonomous suite of renewable energy \nproducts would \u2018take jobs\u2019 in an emerging \u2018gig \nenergy market\u2019 to sell energy back to those who \npay for it the most. In this case beyond energy \nconsuming products, we could even have solar \npanels that bid for energy jobs, pay off their \n47 \n \n \nsponsors, and invest in replicating themselves \nwith automated demands for the production of \nnew solar panels to complement demand. \n \nAfter several iterations on these three initial \nconcepts, the final output of this group was a \nsuite of three similar hairdryers, Gigbliss, which \nloosely follows the three models enunciated \nbefore. These hairdryers mainly differ amongst \nthemselves due to three different user models of \nenergy consumption and management executed \nthrough smart contracts linked to blockchain \nbased energy trading and management platforms.  \n \nThe first hairdryer is Gigbliss AUTO, presented \nunder the slogan \u201cMore for everyone\u201d. This specific \nproduct could be available for free through local \nCouncils, community services and charities. To \nmaximise investment from all actors, it would turn \non at off-peak times, allowing users to use it at no \ncost until the time period ends, with energy only \nsupplied at pre-defined times. A \u201ctimely bargain \nbecause every minute counts\u201d, as the group \nstates. The operation of Gibliss AUTO would imply \na smart contract set by a fictional Gigbliss&Co to \nallocate the sponsor\u2019s budget to supply energy to \nthe max number of households possible, that is. \nsupplying in off-peak times. Moreover, councils or \ncharities could sponsor energy supply for deprived \ncommunities in this context, allocating Gigbliss \ntokens to sponsor energy supply for a large number \nof households, with Gigbliss Coins transferred back \nto the sponsor and Gigbliss Tokens potentially \ntransferred to trading platforms. \n \n \nfig.04 = Detail of Gigliss AUTO operational system  \nThe second hairdryer is Gigbliss BALANCE, \npresented under the motto \u201cBalance is all you \nneed\u201d. When inactive this appliance would trade \nenergy through a smart contract devised on top of \na blockchain, allowing costs and energy prices to \nbe drastically minimised to users. Available at mid \nprice ranges, and allowing users to dry their hair \nwhen energy prices are low, Gigbliss BALANCE \ncould become a convenient and economic option \nfor everyone. Furthermore, to lower costs even \nmore this appliance could also be based on a \nsustainable business model that allow consumers \nto host the hairdryer and return it to the Gigbliss \nfactory when they no longer need it. Similar to the \nprevious model, Gigbliss Coins and Tokens could \nbe also object of transfer and trading, now \nconsidering a scenario where a Gigbliss & Co \ncryptocurrency wallet is put into place. \n \n \nfig.05 = Detail of Gigliss BALANCE operational system  \n \nThe third and last hairdryer of the suite is Gigbliss \nPLUS, attached to the catchphrase \u201cBecause you \nare worth it\u201d. This is a hairdryer that would earn \nmoney for users, trading for instance with a wide \nnet of microgrid energy providers fully integrated \ninto blockchain systems. By combining a patent-\npending energy storage technology with the ability \nto track energy prices, this hairdryer would let \nowners buy energy when prices are low and sell \nwhen they are high, or yet provide an IoT-driven \nsystem that could simply analyse the market, find \nand execute the best deals for these owners. The \nmain idea of Gigbluss PLUS is that it puts the user \nin control compared with the other models. It \nwould still benefit, however, from automated \n48 \n \n \nprocedures where in built smart contracts regulate \ntransactions between it and energy suppliers. \nCoins and Tokens would be exchanged with \nEnergy units now based on standards such as \nERC20, assuming that owners synchronise their \ndevices with their own cryptocurrency wallet as \nsoon as they acquire the hairdryer. \n \n \nfig.06 = Detail of Gigliss PLUS operational system \n \nThe Gigbliss product suite attempts to question \nupfront what kind of changes take place when \nblockchain based systems starts mediating energy \ntransactions between consumers and the grid.  \n \nThe starting point this group had for such \ninterrogations is that nowadays energy provisions \nin Europe are mostly based on large power plants, \nwhich generate energy, transmitting it to national \ngrids and then to cities, companies and \nhouseholds. National grids are well established, \nregulated, and centralised. A few emerging trends, \nhowever, suggest different energy futures. \nDistributed energy generation, for example would \nallow smaller companies and even households to \nproduce and sell energy in a free market economy. \n \nThe key idea is that with blockchain \ninfrastructures, energy can be produced in small \nscales and traded more flexibly and in wider \nscales. This could enhance for instance green \nenergy production, increasing competition and the \ncreation of new ways of consuming and adding \nvalue to energy, according to peak times and access \nto energy storage, for instance. Gigbliss envisions a \nfuture where domestic devices will be able to store \nand/or adapt energy usage to fluctuations in \nprices and demand, thus contributing to a \ndiscussion on the potential relations between \nblockchains and energy systems. \nWithin the Gigbliss scenario, blockchains would \nhave the ability to guarantee data immutability \nbased on cryptography and distribution / \nsynchronisation of records across multiple \nlocations. They can host immutable algorithms, or \nso called smart contracts, which can securely \nperform transactions according to pre-defined \nconditions. This way, blockchains would be used to \nmanage transactions across small energy \nproviders and consumers in a secure and \ntransparent way, allowing new energy production, \ndistribution and consumption models to emerge. \n \nSeveral other questions still emerge through this \nprototype in the Energy sector. Within the domain \nof control and governance of energy for instance, \nthis suite of hairdryers raises the issue about \nconsumer objects and appliances having the \nability to balance energy cost/demand at the point \nof use in a distributed network, rather than \ncentrally, and what would it truly entail at \nregulatory level, for instance. And while doing so, \nthese hairdryers equally challenge existing models \nof material ownership, which have remained \nlargely the same up until recently. Predicated upon \nsmart contracts that allow objects to trade and \nbroker energy deals, the prototypes ask questions \nabout the legal contracts that surround \nincreasingly autonomous products.  \n \n \nfig.07 = Gigliss PLUS automatically trading energy \n \nMoreover, the group states it\u2019s possible to observe \nand question across these three products how \n49 \n \n \ndifferent economies for the purchase and \nconsumption of energy are explored according to \nthe control that we take away from humans, and \ngive to products such as ordinary IoT appliances. \nThis prototype suggests that to tackle behavioural \n\u2018energonomics\u2019, that is personal energy habits, \ndesigning levels of autonomy into objects may \nforce consumers to change their habits in order to \nget the best use of energy, thus increasing the \nmediating role of objects and moving them closer \nto deterministic behavioural patterns. And this \nwould even become more visible if we question \nenvironmental benefits of taking control away \nfrom consumers and placing it in the authorship of \nalgorithms that will seek lower environmental \nimpacts of the use of energy. \n \n \nfig.08 = Gigbliss Suite with AUTO, BALANCE and PLUS prototype models \n \n  \nBlood Sample \ncollected at a  \ndonor\u2019s house\nBlood Donation Kit with \nmaterials for remote collection\nBloodchain App for \ndonor sign-up and \ndata management\n\u2018Florence\u2019 Drone prepared \nfor automatic deployment\n#Transports&Logistics #SupplyChains #FleetManagement #Tracking #Collection #Encryption #MedicalSpecimen \nBloodchain is an assets management system \ndesigned to deal with multiple points of supply and \ndemand for the collection and transport of blood \nand other sensitive biological materials.\nBloodchain\nBloodchain App for \ndonor sign-up and \ndata management\n#Transports&Logistics #SupplyChains #FleetManagement #Tracking #Collection #Encryption #MedicalSpecimen \nBack and Front End Systems _ \nallow people to securely sign-up as donors and \nregister blood type with an encrypted key. /\n/ This is connected to a distributed blood bank \nmanaging supply and demand in real-time.\nHospital Nodes _ \nget access to donor information and receive \nnoti\ufb01cations if desired blood type and other key \ndata sets are added. /\n/ Matching of request and o\ufb00er depends on \ncompatibility criteria and interests\u2019 alignment. \nAutonomous Fleet Management _ \ndispatches drones to people\u2019s homes with \nmaterials for remote blood collection. /\n/ These \ufb02y back to hospitals for checks and use, \nwith guarantees of encrypted privacy for donors.\n52 \n \n \n \nBloodchain \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBloodchain belongs to the transports and logistics \nsector. The members of the group that co-created \nthis prototype were Cat Drew (Uscreates) and \nRobbie Bates  (Uscreates) as lead designers, and \nTravin Keith (Agavon & Member Representative \nHyperledger), Mika Lammi (Kouvola Innovation) \nand Marcella Atzori (University College of London) \nas expert stakeholders. \n \n \nfig.10 = 'Permissioned Blockchain' Jargon Buster card \n \nThe group started their prototype development by \nreflecting not only about contexts where supply \nchains were in need of strengthening, but also \ncontexts where such strengthening would help to \ntackle already existent social issues. As such, \nblood donation and all the logistics involved in it \nwere chosen as their use case.  \n \nThis pick was based on the shortage of voluntary \ndonations in a country such as the UK, and above \nall, on one of the apparent underlying motives for \nthis shortage. Blood collection tends to still \nhappen sporadically, when someone has the \nmotivation and time to go out of their way to visit \na blood donation centre, often only located in \nhospitals, or at best, in mobile donation units. \nAccording to the group, an integrated supply and \ndemand management system enabled by \nblockchain technology could help to address this \nin two ways.  \n \nFirstly, it would allow people to securely register \ntheir blood types into a distributed blood bank \nwhich could manage supply and demand in real-\ntime. Call-outs across the system would be made \nwhen particular blood types were in need. The use \nof a permissioned, multi-chain structure, such as \nHyperledger Iroha, could maintain people\u2019s privacy \nuntil after they had consented to a particular \ndonation, and otherwise keep their blood type \nseparate and unlinked from their personal ID. \nMoreover, applications of AI running on the top of \ndata would be able to foresee the future demand \nof blood, for instance in hospitals, and prevent in \ntime the exhaustion of blood stock. \n \nSecondly, this would allow the deployment of an \nautonomous fleet of drones to be sent out to \npeople\u2019s homes to remotely collect the blood and \nreturn it to the hospital for checking and onward \nuse. The blockchain would allow optimisation of \ndrone workflows, making sure they are in the right \nplace at the right time, and verification of their \njourneys to and from donors\u2019 homes. This would \nreduce infrastructure costs, create savings in \npublic expenditure, and reduce CO2 emissions. \n \nAnother potential use case, Organchain, was also \ndeveloped within the same scenario to showcase \na similar backend demonstration of how the \ntechnology might actually work in practice for the \ntransport of organs. Information about this other \nuse case is available online and it will not be \ndetailed here as this groups\u2019 primary focus was \nput on the Bloodchain system.  \n \nBloodchain includes both digital and non-digital \nartefacts. Across five stages, which are Sign-up, \nBlood Collection, Piggy-backing, Logistics, and \nFleet management, this prototype is meant to \nsimulate how it would work in a real life scenario, \nthus encouraging people to think about the \nimplications of a blockchain-enabled system for \nthe transport of highly sensitive materials.  \n53 \n \n \nWithin the first stage, the Sign-up, we find in the \nprototype a paper based set of cards simulates \nthe various stages of a user signing up to the \nBloodchain system. The process has been \ndesigned to include the technical details of how \nblockchain would be an integral part of this sign-\nup process for potential donors, with the prototype \nfocusing on showcasing the front-end experience \nof becoming a donor and donating blood.  \n \nThe second stage, Blood Collection, has a drone \ndelivery system at the centre, Florence, which is \ndesigned to assist and take blood at home, once \nthe donor completed the sign-up process. The \ndrone includes a soft and \u2018friendly\u2019 aesthetic to \nencourage people to donate. It also includes a \nmock-up package to simulate some of the \nmedical utensils that would come with the drone \nto allow people to take their own blood at home.  \n \n \nfig.11 = Home blood donation kit and blood sample \n \nIn the third stage, Piggy-backing on Existing \nTransport, the prototype takes its concept a step \nfurther. A plane ticket and sticker set bring to life \nthe idea of \u2018donating at the gate\u2019. The underlying \ndiscussion is whether beyond its own \ntransportation means, Bloodchain could also \npiggy-back onto existing transport such as \ncommercial flights, to more efficiently meet \ndemand for blood donation. As an example, if a \nmajor accident happened in Madrid, for instance, \npeople travelling there would be encouraged to \ndonate whilst waiting for their flight. That same \nblood would be registered on the Bloodchain \nsystem and later transported in the same flight.  \n \n \nfig.12 = Boarding pass with Bloodchain donation stickers \n \nThe stage number four, related to Logistics, \ncontains the main interactive piece of the \nBloodchain prototype. This comprises both a back \nand a front end, that is, a functional blockchain \nsystem and an app that allows interaction with \nthat system. These elements will not be fully \ndetailed here, and additional extensive \ninformation about them is available online.  But \naccessed via a tablet this gives a basic \ndemonstration of how people could sign-up and \nuse not only Bloodchain but also Organchain.  \n \nThis includes first a Donor Registration Step, \nwhere users submit personal and medical \ninformation to the system with an encrypted key, \nand where participating hospitals running nodes \nare able to see these properties being set and can \nset up an internal notification system should the \ndesired blood type and other key data be added to \nthe system. In second place, it comprises the \nmatching of the hospital request and donor offer \nbased not only on compatibility criteria but also \non both actors' interests. And in third, it contains \nthe drone blood collection and return, with each \ndrone pre-fitted with their own account on the \nLogistics chain, the hospital having approval \npermissions on the transfer request, and the donor \naccess to notifications guaranteeing save arrival \nof their blood.  \n \nThe blockchain systems used for this prototype \narchitecture are Hyperledger Iroha, which primarily \nhandles the identity management of each patient, \nas well as Ardor, which primarily handles the \nlogistics around the transfer of blood and organs. \nPart of the need for having two blockchain \n54 \n \n \nsystems for this architecture is to further protect \nthe privacy of each patient, as well as to allow the \nlogistics chain to remain unaffected if ever the \nidentity chain needs to have information \ncompletely removed.  \n \n \n \nfig.13 Bloodchain mobile app in beta development \n \nFinally, in the last stage of the prototype, number \nfive, the Bloodchain Drone Fleet Management. \nHere, a specific artefact aims to showcase and \ndescribe how the blood donations and drone are \nmanaged and monitored using chips and QR \ncodes. That artefact is a mock-up blood bag with \nmock-up donated blood, which includes a code \nthat the donor must scan via the Bloodchain app \nto register their donation and validate the \nlegitimacy of their donation.   \n \nThrough Bloodchain multiple questions and \nprovocations are meant to be explored and \ndiscussed, being the most immediate one, \nperhaps, how would people react to it. People \ndon\u2019t often like their blood being taken even by \nthe most reassuring nurses. How would they \nengage with a scenario where giving blood might \nhappen via an autonomous drone? Bloodchain has \nbeen designed to increase privacy and trust into \nthe system through the use of blockchain \ntechnology, and it was also designed to provide a \nreassuring and convenient experience for blood \ndonors. But following this same road, the group \nposes questions such as what kind of responses \nshould be also prepared, from policy to \nbehavioural dimensions, so that systems as \nBloodchain could be adopted in the near future? \n \nIn this scenario, blockchain technologies could \nenable privacy for donors to the bloodbank, and \nsecurity of transport, thus addressing issues such \nas system integrity. However, people could also \nwant to know this technology is full-proof. Digital \nsystems carrying highly sensitive material cannot \nbe allowed to fail as it would compromise their \nlife-saving activity. The nodes which run the \nnetwork and validate transactions need to \nguarantee business and service continuity, \ndisaster recovery, financial stability and \npreservation of data. \n \nBloodchain aims to put the emphasis on a balance \nthat would need to be struck between making \nblood donation easy, attractive and socially \nrewarded, and the potential monetisation / \ntokenisation of the service. Regulation would be \nneeded not only to ensure standards for blood \nbetween different EU countries, but also how \ndonors might be incentivised to provide blood. \n55 \n \n \n \nAs transport and logistics companies think about \nhow to extend into other areas, these issues \nbecome more acute. In this case, what would \nblockchain for organ donation look really like? \nWhere would it be more likely that blood or organs \nwill be transported not just by drones, but by a \ndistributed network of multiple transport carriers? \nDo all of those have to be big suppliers and \ncontracts? How can we all take advantage of the \ntransport that is taking place anyway and for \nother purposes, to ensure efficiency? And will this \nall be obsolete with the creation of synthetic blood \nand organs? Or will we much better be able to \nmatch up demand with supply, with the better \ncommissioning and manufacturing of this material \non demand? \n \n \n \nfig.14 = Bloodchain stages and elements on the prototype's system map \n \n  \nGossip Totem as only point \nto submit and retrieve gossip\nTaxi as enabler of people\u2019s \nactions regarding gossip\nNeighbourhood as main \nspace and recipient of gossip \n#IntellectualProperty #Information #Validation #PredictionMarkets #Reputation #Reliability #DigitalGoods \nGossip Chain allows anyone to submit rumours to\na localised Blockchain and then combines people's \nreputations and prediction markets to assess and \nregister the information value and reliability.\nGossip Chain\n#IntellectualProperty #Information #Validation #PredictionMarkets #Reputation #Reliability #DigitalGoods \nNew Rumours _ \ncan only be submitted and retrieved at a Gossip \nTotem physically localized in the neighbourhood . / \n/ A Gossip Wallet then allows everyone to \nparticipate and receive rewards through\nprediction markets.\nInformation Reliability _\nis assessed based on the reputation of the \nperson that submits the content. / \n/ This in turn depends on market demand for \ntheir gossip, and other people vouching for them \nand the content itself. \nVerifying Gossip _ \nguarantees \ufb01nancial rewards through a smart \ncontract attached to the Gossip Wallet. /\n/ But \ufb01nancial sanctions also exists if enough \nevidence is added to contradict the information \noriginally provided. \n58 \n \n \n \nGossip Chain \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGossip Chain is positioned within the creative \nindustries sector. The group that lead its co-\ncreation had Enrique Encinas (M-ITI / Madeira \nInteractive Technologies Institute) and James \nAuger (M-ITI / Madeira Interactive Technologies \nInstitute) as lead designers, and Jaya Klara Brekke \n(Durham University), Juan Blanco (Consensys \nSystems) and Carlotta de Ninni (Mycelia) as expert \nstakeholders. \n \n \nfig.16 = 'On the Block' Scenario where Gossip Chain exists  \n \nThe group explored this sector by pinpointing a \nparticular historical context where the circulation \nof information was being challenged by traditional \ninstitutions and social actors on the ground, and \nwhere alternative solutions where devised for \ninformation spreading at bottom-up level. This \ncontext was the Tahir Square\u2019s protests on \nJanuary 2011, and the inspiration behind the \nprototype was not only the difficulty to \ndisseminate information without unconditioned \naccess to internet or other major \ntelecommunication infrastructures, but especially \nhow to insure information was not halted at \nspecific points of the chain, due to suspicions or \ndivergent views that would evolve into arguments \nand discussion rather than diffusion.  \n \nThe solution found at the time was to take \nadvantage of taxi drivers\u2019 \u2018gift of gab\u2019 and position \nin a physical social network. Activists on the \nground realised that if they could direct \nconversations towards the gathering at Tahir, taxi \ndrivers would spread the word and the protest \nwould be a success. But instead of direct \nconversations that were mainly resulting into \narguments and discussions, the strategy was to \nexploit the use of gossip. Thus, they allowed taxi \ndrivers to overhear cell phone conversations \nwhere details of the protests would be disclosed, \nso that they could eavesdrop believing to have \noverheard a secret and subsequently spread the \ninformation.  \n \nBlockchains create new possibilities for governing \nand registering content in new and more open \nways, allowing for trusted management, shared \ndata and knowledge layers across industries. In \nGossip Chain, however, the more informal aspects \nof these questions are explored, tracing what \nmight happen if the more volatile and \nunpredictable nature of rumours and gossip \nbecome tokenised, formalised and immutable on \nthe blockchain. \n \nThe Gossip Chain prototype is placed within a \nlarger scenario named On the Block, an imaginary \ncity where informal knowledge becomes \nintellectual property through the blockchain. This \nscenario simulates a neighbourhood where a taxi \nbecomes not only a vehicle for transportation but \nalso a vessel for the capture of informal \nexchanges of rumours. It expands the case of \ngossip as common knowledge that circulates and \nis registered but whose meaning mutates with the \near that hears it and the mouth that voices it.  \n \nIn this On the Block scenario, a different path of \nlight arises depending on the route the taxi \nfollows. Mimicking the path a rumour follows \nwhen it spreads. Gossip happen within the taxi \nand can be only heard from certain perspectives. \nThe taxi is moved by human hands towards the \nTaxi Stop marked by the GossipTotem, triggering \nmagnetic switches when it travels, and creating a \nunique light path depending on its route. Finally, \n59 \n \n \nonce the vehicle arrives at a specific taxi stop the \ngossip is registered on the blockchain and made \nbroadly accessible and marketable, through the \nexistence of a Gossip Totem. One of the buildings \nin the scenario has a directional speaker that \nbroadcasts gossip in a very specific direction. As \nsuch, it is only from one corner of the model that \none can hear the voices whispering and try to \nguess its meaning. With this effect, the prototype \nencourages people to discover the source of the \ngossip, to move around the model and possibly \ninvite commentary on how gossip is generated \nand heard from certain perspectives. \n \n \nfig.17 = Taxi as enabler of people's interactions with rumours \n \nGossip Chain can be therefore described as a \nreputation and market-backed ledger of rumours, \nusing uses scores and prediction markets to \nassess the value and reliability of a given piece of \ngossip. Gossip about a specific place can only be \nsubmitted to the chain at the gossip totem for the \nneighbourhood. Reliability is assessed based on \nthe reputation of the person submitting the gossip. \nThere are two ways that contributors gain \nreputation. First, through market demand for their \ngossip. And second, through checkers who vouch \nfor a piece of gossip by adding their signatures. \nEvidence for and against the piece of gossip is \nincentivised by a prediction market. Those signing \nthe piece of gossip will gain financial rewards for \nverifying the information but on the other hand \nwill be financially punished if evidence is added \nthat contradicts this information.  \n \nGossip Chain was not developed as a single use \ncase, however, as the group decided to develop \ntwo other secondary use cases that operate on \nsimilar grounds to Gossip Chain. These are Civic \nChain and Maker Chain. The first suggests a model \nbased on hashing tables where verification of \nlocal knowledge is done deliberately rather than \nvia the market and contributes to a common \nresource of local histories and knowledge. While \nthe second allows for a community of makers to \ndetermine differential access based on fine-\ngrained commons and commercial contractual \narrangements.. These secondary use cases will not \nbe detailed here. But they are fully are accessible \nonline as further possibilities to explore the \nBlockchain dynamics allowed by the validation \nand verification mechanisms already in place for \nthe Gossip Chain use case. \n  \nBlockchains are used within this whole scenario \nfor identity validation, tokenisation of gossip and \nreputation, prediction markets based on tokens. \nBootstrapping a public blockchain platform based \non systems such as Ethereum network, Gossip \nChain is created through a smart contract \nresponsible for all the Gossip system functionality. \nThe Gossip application acts then as the interface \nbetween the public blockchain, Decentralised \nStorage Systems, such as IPFS, where gossip \ndetails in digital format are recorded, Search and \nIndexing databases, such as IPDB, and \nDecentralised Identity Systems such as uPort or \nCircles.   \n \n \nfig.18 = Taxi Stop where the Gossip Totem is localised \n \nThe core elements that would allow Gossip Chain \nto function are the Gossip Totem, a \nneighbourhood physically localized artefact where \nGossip about a local place is submitted and \nretrieved, and the Gossip Wallet which allows a \nperson to submit new Gossip, retrieve Gossip \n60 \n \n \ninformation and participate and receive rewards in \nthe Gossip prediction markets.  \n \nThere is a custom local application for validators \nresponsible for gossip classification that allows \npeople to challenge gossip but also to automate \nclassification using artificial intelligence. This \nwould be done considering that to automate the \nprocess of classification of Gossip entries and \ndetails, validators may also use artificial \nintelligence components to simplify the \nclassification process. On top, gossip would also \nbe verified through price mechanisms in a \nprediction market, such as Gnosis or Augur, where \npeople can bet on what gossip is truthful or not.  \n \nA possible explanation of how Gossip Chain would \nwork can be explored using a storyline with Alice \nand Bob.  \n \nAlice has many friends in the catering industry \nand has recently heard that Bob, the owner of an \notherwise very popular competitor restaurant does \nnot have the correct immigration papers. She \nsubmits this gossip on the GossipChain. The \nrestaurant is popular, so plenty of people want to \nhear what her gossip is and pay for access to it, \nand Alice quickly starts to make money from \nsubmitting this gossip. Five of Alice\u2019s friends sign \nher piece of gossip, giving her a good reputation \nthat further increases the value of her gossip. In \nthe meantime, Bob the restaurant owner is getting \nworried that immigration will check the \nGossipChain and cause problems at his restaurant. \nHe submits a challenge to her gossip, and because \nhis restaurant is so popular gains plenty of \nsignatures in his favour. The more people sign his \nchallenge against Alice\u2019s gossip, the more Alice\u2019s \nreputation as well as that of her co-signatories \ngoes down, potentially affecting their future ability \nto earn from submitting gossip. Alice was counting \non licencing her accumulated gossip about the \ncatering industry to a high profile food magazine \nbut the value of her gossip is dropping due to the \nsignatures gathered against her claim. A \nsecondary prediction market taking bets on the \noutcome is primarily backing Alice\u2019s claim, driving \nmore people to go to the neighbourhood \nGossipTotem to submit signatures supporting \nAlice. The neighbourhood rallies in support for Bob, \nholding pickets and picnics by the GossipTotem to \nprevent anyone from supporting Alice with more \nsignatures. Alice watches, as her future ability to \nearn from her GossipChain reputation is \ndetermined through the competition between the \nprediction market and Bob\u2019s popularity in the \nneighbourhood and ability to gather support and \nsignatures. \n \n \nfig.19 Detail of Gossip Chain's operational scheme \n \nWithin such a context, Gossip Chain aims to \nquestion how knowledge is created and spread in \nthe first place, and what happens when it is \nturned into intellectual property for instance. \nTaking advantage of the authority a data-entry \nhas once it is added to the blockchain, Gossip \nChain in the On the Block scenario plays with the \ninteractions between the informal and untrusted \nand the highly formalised and trustworthy.  \n \n \nfig.20 = Detail of the larger On the Block scenario \n \nGossip Chain questions how information can be \ninstitutionalised into more structured forms such \n61 \n \n \nas intellectual property, and who it is produced by \nand for whom. It raises questions on the existence \nof intellectual property that adds intrigue to \ninformation, intellectual property that is produced \nand consumed locally, or that finds its value in the \nscarce and colloquial rather than the ubiquitous \nand global. And in the end it poses bigger \nquestions on the plausibility or desirability of \nfuture market places and commercial applications \nbased on such a system. \n \nThese questions are referenced by appealing to \nthe ability of blockchain technologies to re-\nintroduce scarcity into the otherwise fluid space \nand endless copies of digital assets in a \ncontinuously changing creative industries sector. \nInstead of reproducing and reinforcing the same \nrelations of property rights in the digital space, the \ngroup questions what are the new and fine-\ngrained ways that blockchain facilitates the \ncuration of conditions of access and a contribution \nto digital goods? How might blockchain not simply \nenforce but radically transform what intellectual \nproperty is in the cultural sector? And what could \nbe the real new possibilities that arise for cultural \nagents from the application of blockchain in \ncontexts such as those explored in the On the \nBlock scenario? \n \n \n \nfig.21 = Full Panorama of the prototype with Gossip Chain in motion  \n \n \n \n \n  \nInformation Panel accessed by \nconsumer when \ufb01nished with a product \nInformation Panel accessed by \nproduct liability insurance broker\nInformation Panel accessed by \nconsumer at point-of-purchase\nInformation Panel accessed \nby agile factory owner\nSystem App with full \ninformation library\n#AdvancedManufacturing #MaterialsLibrary #DigitalTwins #SupplyChains #InformationIntegrity #AgileFactories\nVantage Point is a platform tackling data sharing, \ninteroperability and integrity in manufacturing systems \nby storing products' digital twins and providing distinct \ninformation on them based on speci\ufb01c actors\u2019 needs .\nVantage Point\n#AdvancedManufacturing #MaterialsLibrary #DigitalTwins #SupplyChains #InformationIntegrity #AgileFactories\nDigital Twins _ \nof consumer products are created with their full \nhistory from cradle to cradle. /\n/ These twins are then stored on blockchains to \nensure authenticity, validity and interoperability \nof the contained information .\nTracking and Tracing _\nof materials and processes is made possible at \nevery point of the supply chain. /\n/ Information integrity is guaranteed through \ncombined, immutable, real-time data through a \ndecentralised database.\nMultiple Actors  _ \nin the same chain get access to distinct \ninformation sets. / \n/ These sets are adapted to their needs, based \non the use of private key cryptography linked to \ndistinct agent pro\ufb01les and permissions.  \n64 \n \n \n \nVantage Point \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVantage Point was developed inside the advanced \nmanufacturing sector. The group behind it is \nconstituted by Liz Corbin (Institute of Making, \nUniversity College of London) and James Tooze \n(Royal College of Art) as lead designers, Burkhard \nBlechschmidt (Cognizant Technology Solutions), \nPierre-Alexis Ciavaldini (Particl Foundation), and \nWessel Reijers (Dublin City University) as expert \nstakeholders, and Romain Meunier (Institute of \nMaking, University College of London) in support \nto the prototype production. \n \n \nfig.23 = Visualisation panel with second-hand scooter. \n \nThe main challenge chosen by this group was the \nopaqueness of manufacturing chains. Their \nunderlying assumption was that much of the \ninformation within these chains is currently kept \nwithin silos, fragmented and disconnected across \nwhat are often multi-actor, multi-sited systems. \nThis often comes as result of a lack of \nauthentication and verification of information \nshared between different stakeholders, all \nmanaging their own information silos throughout \nthe manufacturing process. And it implies not only \na lack of transparency between agents, but also \nlack of trust that leads to ineffective decision-\nmaking by individual actors as decisions become \nbased upon speculation rather than real-time, \nimmutable data.  \n \nVantage Point attempts to go against the troubles \nthat manufacturers often have to exchange \nproduction information with other manufacturers, \nas they don\u2019t have guarantees that information \ncan be trusted or that intellectual property \ncontained in information transfers is respected. \nMoreover, the prototype also aims to insert itself \nwhere product designers commonly have little \nclarity of exactly where, by whom, and at what \ncosts product will be manufactured, as they rarely \nhave a clear line of communication with other \nactors across the supply chain. And last but not \nleast, Vantage Point even looks for a place in the \nconsumer space, where actors usually have also \nno idea where their products truly come from, or if \nthey are made and distributed in responsible and \nsustainable ways, for example. \n \nThis prototype aims to address such problems by \ncreating a digital twin for each and every \nconsumer product from cradle to cradle, which is \nthen stored on a distributed ledger such as a \nblockchain system, in order to ensure the \nauthenticity, validity and interoperability of the \ninformation it consists of.  \n \nBy using blockchains as focal management point \nof a highly intricate materials library, Vantage \nPoint would allow products in a manufacturing \nprocess to be tracked and traced at every point \nthroughout its various use stages and life-cycles, \nthus granting it a complete historical record. But \nmost significantly, it would enable new ways to \nvisualize and sort out complex information from \nmultiple perspectives, as it could grant each \nstakeholder access to a particular \u2018vantage point\u2019 \nadapted to their needs through the use of private \nkey cryptography linked to distinct agent \npermissions.  \n \nThe Vantage Point is materialized through this \nprototype in an app that has a companion system \nof simulated holographic projections to help users \nbetter visualize the information they require. This \n65 \n \n \nwas designed to allow actors such as \nmanufacturers to easily retrieve and visualize \ninformation about material properties, certification \nbodies to get data about compliance with \nstandards, and consumers about companies and \nmaterials involved in the process, all captured in \nthe \u201cdigital twin\u201d residing on a blockchain and \naccessible through the app.  \n \nFollowing the prototype development, to \nunderstand it with a finer grain we may look at \nhow the group pictured several actors interacting \nwith Vantage Point, and what would they get out \nof it considering a particular product. For instance, \nwe may pick the example of a second hand \nscooter and envision how a manager of a small \nscale agile factory, Carol would use the platform \nand what she could say about it.  \n \nIn her automotive factory orders have been in \nsteady decline over the last five years, which has \nresulted in a great deal of latent capacity on the \nproduction floor. Rather than reducing shifts or \nstaff size, Carol started using Vantage Point to \nmake use of their latent capacity by producing \ncomponent parts for a brand of motor scooters. \nCarol used to be very cautious about taking on \nadditional production jobs. This frequently meant \nlong-winded and unreliable streams of \ncommunication between various actors across the \nsupply chain. And it often made such opportunities \ntoo complicated and risky to take on regardless of \ntheir obvious benefits to our bottom line. Thanks \nto Vantage Point, Carol now has access to a \nreliable information source that easily and \nefficiently connects me to the product\u2019s wider \nmulti-actor, multi-sited supply chain. Vantage \nPoint acts as a one-stop-shop for accessing vital \ninformation across the whole chain in real-time -\nfrom the technical specifications of components, \nto peer-reviewed reputations of other \nmanufacturers in the chain; from the material \nspecifications of the components, to any delays \noccurring at other points of the production \nprocess. Because the majority of this information \nis registered in real-time on an immutable ledger, \nCarol can be certain of its integrity. The \ntransparency and integrity of Vantage Point has \nallowed Carol to flexible in their production \ndecisions working securely and efficiently within \nmulti-actor supply chains. \n \nfig.24 = App information as accessed by factory owner \n \nFrom another viewpoint, we could now picture \nhow David, a product liability insurance broker, \ncould make use of the same system, and what \nwould he obtain, considering the same second \nhand scooter. \n \nAs an insurance broker, assessing the liability of \nproducts that are a result of multi-actor, multi-\nsited supply chains has always proven difficult for \nDavid. The challenge has been in developing \nwarranties that can embrace the flexibility and \nfast-paced nature of real-time distributed design, \nproduction and assembly. Blockchain technologies \nlike Vantage Point are an ideal solution to claims \nhandling for retail products that are manufactured \nacross a decentralised supply chain. Through \nVantage Point David can ensure objective \ninsurance policy criteria are encoded into the \nsmart contracts that surround the production of a \n66 \n \n \nproduct. By using smart contracts in this way \nDavid can automate peer-to-peer and sensor \nmonitored assessments from trusted authoritative \nsources in order to determine whether the claims \nconditions are being satisfied. Current Claims \nVantage Point creates an environment of trust \nbetween insurer, customer, manufacturer and \nregulator and ensures that claims are assessed in \na timely, transparent, and evidence based manner. \nIn this way, it enables David to collaborate across \nmulti-actor, multi-sited supply chains while still \ncreating legal accountability. \n \n \nfig.25 = App information as accessed by insurance broker \n \nAnd last, but not least, we can look at how Frank, \nowner at the end of its relationship with the second \nhand scooter, would interact with Vantage Point. \n \nAfter ten years of use, Frank\u2019s motor scooter is \nnearing the end of its life. He feels that is often \nimpossible to understand the various disposal, re-\nsale, re-use and recycle options that are available \nto the owner of a product at the end of its life. \nSome options can be gathered from various \nreferences like user manuals, local recycling \ncentres, and regional resale networks. Yet, almost \nalways these references are difficult to cross-\ncompare and noticeably incapable of speaking to \nthe specificities of your particular product. He now \nsees that his scooter and its history have been \ntracked and traced throughout its life by Vantage \nPoint. By accessing the scooter\u2019s history through \nVantage Point Frank is able to make a more \ninformed decision about what re-sell and recycle \noptions are available for him. He is then able to \nmore clearly see what component parts of the \nscooter fit within various local recycling \ninfrastructure, and estimate the scooter\u2019s \ndepreciated value should he decide to resell it \nonline. And because Vantage Point provides \ndetailed technical and material information about \nthe scooter, Frank is also capable of exploring \nwhat new uses for the scooter\u2019s component parts \nare possible. Thanks to Vantage Point he can \nmake much clearer and responsible decisions for \nhow best his scooter can be reused and recycled. \n \n \nfig.26 = App information as accessed by consumer \n67 \n \n \nThis is the value proposition of this prototype as a \nblockchain based database. It would create a \ndesired effect of information scarcity, meaning \nthat a \u201cdigital twin\u201d of a product would always \nrefer exactly that particular product and \ninformation integrity, and meaning the \ninformation a consumer retrieves about the origin \nof the materials in a product is the single one \navailable to everyone, and exactly the same as \nthe information recorded at the moment when the \nmaterials were extracted for instance. But it would \nalso allow for different stakeholders to retrieve \nthe information they need at all times and be \ncertain that such information would be about that \nexact product or part of the manufacturing \nprocess they\u2019re looking for, and, above all, that the \nintegrity of the information would be guaranteed.   \n \nVantage Point could reduce the barriers to data \nexchange with strong focus on data protection, \nmaking it not only easier to lower barriers of entry \ninto manufacturing markets, thus fostering \ncompetition and innovation, but also to respect \nintellectual property by tracking and tracing IP \nrights. Moreover, it would also function as a \ncrucial enabler of the circular economy, by \nsupporting the ethical production, consumption \nand disposal of consumer products, offering not \nonly value for each party engaged in \nmanufacturing chains, but also for societal \nstructures as a whole. \n \nfig.27 = Vantage Point prototype with information app and visualisation panels  \n \n  \nAnonymous ID Cards \nwith private keys \nBlood Testing Slot \nbased on nano Labs-on-Chips \nMicro Printer \nfor diagnosis \ndelivery\nCard Reader for decryption \nof medical history data\nApp Interface \nfor non-hospitalised \ntests and diagnosis\n#Health #IdentityManagement #Authentication #Anonymisation #Arti\ufb01cialIntelligence #InvisiblePopulations \nCare AI is a service providing access to basic healthcare \nin exchange of anonymised personal health data, which \nis later connected through smart contracts to a data \nmarketplace for third party public and private entities.\nCare AI\n#Health #IdentityManagement #Authentication #Anonymisation #Arti\ufb01cialIntelligence #InvisiblePopulations \nAutomated Networks _ \nof CareAI Points provide non-hospitalised test \nand diagnosis for people without access to \ntraditional healthcare. /\n/ Labs-on-Chips are distributed for free and \ninclude materials for blood sampling and testing. \nAnonymous Identity Cards _ \nallow users to donate personal health data in \nexchange for healthcare. /\n/ A private key serves to decrypt the card \nholder\u2019s medical history and upload new \ncollected data onto a smart contract.\nPublic Bodies or Businesses _ \ncan pay to access information for research, \nplanning, or other purposes. / \n/ This subsidises medical treatments while \nalso paying pruducers, owners and \nmaintainers of Care AI Points. \n70 \n \n \n \nCare AI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe sector to which Care AI belongs to is the \nhealth sector.

These populations experience \nconstraints in accessing health care due to legal, \nsocial or economic limitations, and usually find \nthemselves in the absence of answers for this \nsituation. \n \nCareAI is a platform conceived to allow such \ninvisible populations to get not only access to \nbasic healthcare but also information about other \nmeans by which they can obtain support to \nproceed further into curing their illnesses and \nensuring a sustained good quality of life. What is \nmore, is that if for some of these groups the \ncrucial point is the need to access healthcare \nwithout compromising their identity, Care AI is \ndesigned to allow it. \n \nThis prototype was developed as such by having \nits starting point in questions of identity \nmanagement and data authentication and \ncertification, and its conceptualization orbited \naround data anonymization, or at least data \npseudonymization. According to the development \nassumptions of the group behind Care AI, as \nsensitive health data would not be directly linked \nto personal identities, but to elements such as \nanonymous card and registries, compliance with \ndata privacy regulations would more easily \nachievable, even if requiring further legal analysis \nconsidering new data security policies and \nregulatory frameworks such as GDPR.  \n \nWhile personal identification does not follow \nestablished legal and jurisdictional definitions in \nthis scenario, an alternative understanding of \n\u201cidentity\u201d based on health data is proposed. As a \nresult, the proposed solution allows the inclusion \nof people usually left out of healthcare for diverse \nreasons, not creating, however, further exclusion.  \n \nThe Care AI system operates as a network of \nmicro-entrepreneurial owned, automated CareAI \nPoints. Each CareAI Point provides non-\nhospitalized test and diagnosis to people without \naccess to traditional health care. The CareAI Point \ninteracts with a CareAI Smart Contract running on \nany smart-contract-enabled blockchain, such as \nthose possible through the Ethereum network. \n \nWithin the scenario proposed by Care AI, we find \nErin, an undocumented migrant in need of medical \nassistance for an illness he has have contracted \nrecently. Due to her irregular migratory situation, \nErin is afraid to visit a doctor within the national \nhealthcare system, and cannot afford any of the \nprivate care services offered at her location. \n71 \n \n \nThrough the implementation of Care AI as a \nservice targeted to individuals with his profile, \nLabs-on-Chips (LOCs) are distributed for free in \nhomeless shelters, pharmacies and other places \nand grant access to any Care AI Point. Erin \nacquires a LOC in one of these places and finds \nout that it includes a fingerstick for venous blood \ncollection and further analysis. She reads the \ninstructions provided, pricks her finger and deposit \na small sample of blood onto the chip. After this, \nErin proceeds to enter the chip into one of the \nCare AI Points, establishing the connection \nbetween her blood sample and her personal \nidentity with an anonymous card.   \n \n \nfig.30 = Simulated fingerstick with blood for analysis  \n \nA recurring user would be able to scan their card \nat any CareAI Point, while a new user would \ninvited to generate a new private key and get a \nnew card printed out during the first interaction \nwith the system. However, the personal identity \ncard used in Care AI could have several categories \nof personal data and even be one that users \nalready possess to use other services, providing \nthat it at least has means of interaction and \nauthentication adequate for data anonymization. \nIn the prototype this card is simulated through a \ngeneric QR code card, but in a real life scenario it \nwould also include a private key and used as \nsimple means of authentication to the system, \ndecrypting the medical history of the card holder \nand uploading new encrypted records for the card \nholder onto the CareAI Smart Contract.  \n \nErin\u2019s blood sample is anonymous and analysed \nat one of the CareAI Points by a HealthBot \nArtificial Intelligence assistant. The machine asks \nfor consent for this anonymous data to be shared \nfor medical research and upon approval prints out \na receipt with a potential diagnosis and \nsuggestions for further action. This action may \ndepend on the degree of confidence of the \nanalysis conducted, but it may go from \nrecommendations for self-care, to prescriptions at \nparticipating pharmacies and escalation to \nmedical attention at NGO doctors. If the process \ngoes accordingly to previewed, Erin would then be \nasked if she would like to add the results to her \nanonymous logbook for later reference, and if so, \nanother card with a bespoke QR code would be \nissued, which then Erin could use later on to \ncreate a medical issue with each data exchange \nwith a Care AI point.. \n \n \nfig.31 = Mock-up of Care AI diagnostic receipt \n \nThe underlying idea behind the Care AI system is \nthat in exchange for the analysis, suggestions for \nfurther actions or additional information, the \nperson also donates its anonymized health data. \n72 \n \n \nAnd in all this process, Care AI strives to promote \nthe creation of anonymized medical history for \nfuture diagnosis and future potential integration \ninto traditional healthcare systems. However, as \nthe amount and type of information the user \ndecides to provide and donate to the Care AI \nsystem can vary greatly, in this scenario such \nvariations would also imply different gains for the \nuser in a sort of credit system, whether in terms \nof the information received, whether in terms of \npossibilities of access to healthcare. \n \n \nfig.32 = Care AI stakeholder system diagram \n \nPublic authorities could be the first actor \nmanaging this information and allowing the \nsystem to self-finance itself through the creation \nof distributed apps (\u00d0apps). These would allow not \nonly public health and research bodies to access \nthe anonymised data through the smart contracts \ninscribed in the blockckain, but also third parties \nwith market goals to make use of the same \ninformation if granted access. Payments would \nserve to subsidise the medical treatment while \nalso paying the creators, owners and maintainers \nof Care Ai Points. While diagnostics work is \ndelegated to an AI, this is not expected to entail a \nloss of medical jobs, as the target would not \naccess healthcare without CareAI and NGOs would \nbe involved in case of escalation. \n \nAccess to medical insights could help to better \nplan public funding and policies such as in the \nforecast and potential management of seasonal \noutbreaks. But the potential of the data collected \nand exchanged through Care AI could even go \nbeyond health, allowing authorities to become \naware of other ongoing issues within these \ninvisible communities, thus building information \non socio-economic dimensions or demographic \nshifts, and gain plan accordingly to it in an \nintegrated fashion.  \n \nOther actors could come also into play in the \nsame scenario, such as Startups and other SMEs. \nHaving heard of the CareAI project, they can \ndownload Care AI Point blueprints, fabricate their \nown or even iterate new models, and being bound \nto the main smart contract protocols they will be \nonly dependant on public authorizations to deploy \nthe Care AI Points into the public space. These \ncompanies will receive remuneration for data \naccessed, and would be as such incentivised to \nkeep their machines working. In addition, to foster \nthe growth of the network a research spin-off that \nprovide LOCs or works with Care AI points, can run \nInitial Coin Offerings (ICO) to fund the research \nand development of the CareAI Point Open \nHardware and Software specification, the smart \ncontract code and the data specification. \n \nQuestions may emerge, however, with such new \nbusiness and innovation models. These third party \nactors can exploit low entrance barriers in \nproducing LOCs and replicating Care AI Points for \ninstance, and flood the market in ways that are \ncounterproductive considering the main social \ngoals of Care AI. Or yet, big and established \nbiotech companies can take advantage of their \nforefront market position and become the major \nsupply of LOCs to all micro-companies deploying \nCareAI Points, thus promoting monopolist practices.  \nIn this case a central body could issue a payment \nto the CareAI Smart Contract, which would then \n73 \n \n \nallow it to decrypt a number of records collected \nby different CareAI Points, in a first-in first-out \nmanner. This could help to redistribute the \npayment not only to managers or maintainers of \ndifferent CareAI Points but also to different \nproviders of supplementary technologies such as \nLOCs. Moreover, it could also help not only to \ncover costs and provide economic incentives for a \nbigger number of players, but also the creation \nand inputing of soft regulatory measures into the \nmarket.  \n \nBeyond its main social function, the Care AI \nprototype aims to showcase how to stimulate \nentrepreneurship through open hardware and \ndistributed manufacturing, creating a blockchain \nbased marketplace in which the local CareAI Point \nproviders, parties interested in purchasing the \nanonymous medical history records and \nhealthcare authorities can cooperate in a trust-\nfree fashion. But looming questions remain in the \nend. Does all this respect or even consider ethical \nimplications of a personal-data-for-healthcare \nexchange? And will any of the players involved in \nthe production and exploitation of Care AI Points \never think about the kind of problems they might \nbe causing for the creation of more inclusive \nhealthcare systems?   \n \n  \n \n \n \nfig.33 = Care AI Point with ID cards, fingersticks, and diagnostic receipt being printed \n \n \n74 \n \n \n5. Key Insights for Industrial Transformations  \n \nBased on what we seen so far, Blockchain and \nother DLTs have potential to affect large parts of \ncurrent industrial landscapes. At the same time \nthe wide range of possibilities place us in an \nexploratory mode looking on how the \nimplementation and uptake of these technologies \ncould reshape or create innovative products, \nservices, processes or models.  Drawing from our \nextensive research in the project #Blockchain4EU \nthis chapter will present our assessment of main \ninsights for industrial transformations that revolve \naround or engage with Blockchain and other DLTs. \nA number of benefits and challenges that are \nalready visible or may arise in the near future will \nbe identified across a set of policy, economic, \nsocial, technological, legal and environmental \ndimensions. \n \n5.1. Dynamics of Blockchain Space \n \nBlockchain is an early-stage and experimental \ntechnology, which still needs time and space to \nwork out many of its uncertainties over its present \ndevelopments and future directions. Yet, any \ntechnological uptake concerns not only technical \nsuccesses and failures, but also surrounding \nbusiness and economic models, supporting \necosystems, social conditions, legal frameworks \nand policy decisions that will shape possible paths \nforward for the Blockchain space. \n \nIn terms of its technical properties, a \nnumber of unsolved issues or still under \ndevelopment will most likely subsist in the \nnear future (for more detailed account see \nchapter 3). There isn\u2019t just \u2018a Blockchain\u2019 but many \ndifferent Blockchains with diverse architectures \ndepending on the purposes in mind. One of the \nmost crucial choices in design concerns the \npermissionless (public), permissioned (private) and \nhybrid continuum, and related disputes over \nscalability, energy consumption, security, privacy \nand protection of personal and sensitive data. \n \nIn terms of scalability and performance, \npermissionless or public blockchains \ncurrently face limits in terms of amount of \ndata to be included in any given \u2018block\u2019 and \nthe number and speed of transactions, which \nneed to be validated and disseminated across the \nwhole network. Possible solutions such as \nincreasing block size or introducing new \nconsensus mechanisms or protocols based on \nsidechains or off-chains, are still being tested. So \nfar hybrid or permissioned blockchains are \nmore effective in scaling up as transactions \ncan be processed only by a limited and predefined \nnumber of participants or nodes. \n \nSimilar concerns apply to high energy \nconsumption necessary to run \npermissionless or public blockchains, in \nparticular due to the \u2018Proof-of-Work\u2019 \nunderlying mining process. Some say eventual \nadvances will make mining operations more \nefficient, or other consensus mechanisms like \n\u2018Proof-of-Stake\u2019 will eliminate the need for \nintensive competition between participants to \nvalidate transactions. \n \nWhen it comes to security, unlike centralised \nsystems, there is no single point of failure in \npermissionless or public blockchains which \nmakes them extremely resilient to takeovers, \nmanipulations or collisions. Yet, security \nvulnerabilities might arise in the future \nthrough the use of quantum computing, or in \nthe present through the theft, hack or \ncompromise of private and public keys. Also \npermissioned or private blockchains are \npotentially more vulnerable due for instance to \nhigher likelihood of attacks targeted at a core \ngroup of participants or collusions among \nindividuals or groups of participants. \n \nWhen it comes to privacy and protection of \npersonal or sensitive data, transparency and \nimmutability in permissionless blockchains \nmake it a very hard problem to keep certain \ndata out of the chain, or to alter it later due \nto errors or inaccuracies. Moreover, Blockchain \ncryptographic protocols offer \npseudonymisation, not complete \nanonymisation, which could still lead to re-\nidentification of specific data subjects in indirect \n75 \n \n \nand remote cases. A number of ongoing research \nis developing additional cryptographic protocols \nsuch as zero knowledge proofs to tackle these \nproblems. Hybrid or permissioned blockchains \ncurrently offer more flexibility to configure \ndifferent levels of access to data, which \nallows for limiting the availability of personal, \nsensitive or private information in a case by case \nlogic. \n \nWhatever the possible technical solutions to be \ndeveloped in upcoming years, interoperable \nprotocols should be promoted so that \ndifferent Blockchain products and services \ndon\u2019t end up closed, unable to communicate \nwith each other. Interoperability could be \nachieved through standardisation at supranational \nlevel, following current efforts from \nstandardisation organisations working on \nBlockchain and DLTs132. On one hand, some argue \nthat such standardisation will be essential to \nharmonize its applications, de-niche the \ntechnology and enable cross-industry adoption. \nOn the other hand, others argue that premature \nadoption might validate still untested technologies \nand/or privilege solutions from influential \ncompanies and lock out new players. \n \nChallenges of ongoing standardisation activities \nconcern not only the fragmented and nascent \nbody of conceptual and practical knowledge on \nBlockchain, but also the lack of integration of \ncertain Blockchain communities which tend to be \nmore disconnected from these activities or \novershadowed by larger technological or \ncommercial members133. Dangers of platform or \nvendor lock-ins should be minimised by inclusive \nprocesses that would allow in practice newer or \n                                                          \n132 See for instance International Standards Organisation (ISO) \nTechnical Committee 307 on Blockchain and Distributed \nLedger Technologies  \n<https://www.iso.org/committee/6266604.html>; International \nTelecommunications Union (ITU) Focus Group on Application of \nDistributed Ledger Technology (FG DLT) \n<https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-\nT/focusgroups/dlt/Pages/default.aspx>; European Committee \nfor Standardization (CEN) and the European Committee for \nElectrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) Focus Group on \nBlockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) \n<https://www.cencenelec.eu/news/articles/Pages/AR-2017-\n012.aspx> \n133 Adrianne Jeffries, \u2018\u201cBlockchain\u201d Is Meaningless\u2019, The Verge, \n7 March 2018 \n<https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/7/17091766/blockchain-\nbitcoin-ethereum-cryptocurrency-meaning>. \nsmaller players to participate in a meaningful \nway, taking into account their possible limitations \nof time, capital and human resources. \n \nIt is crucial to improve current \nmultistakeholder governance processes for \nthe development of standards, in order to \nfulfil in practice the guiding principles of \nopenness, transparency and consensus134. \nFurthermore, the development of open standards \nalso done independently within the Blockchain \nspace should be carefully considered. Take the \nexample of the wide implementation of ERC-20135 \nin ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) as the technical \nstandard for Ethereum based tokens or smart \ncontracts, or the recent efforts to build common \nframeworks for an open source and shared ledger \nof rights owners in the music and media \nbusiness136. The vitality of these and other efforts \npoint towards the importance of grassroots \nand open source research in the Blockchain \nspace137, also taking the example of other \ndecentralised technologies and communities138. \n \nThe development of open standards in the \nBlockchain space should also be linked to other \nstandardisation processes in specific industrial ?_ \nnon-financial sectors or in relevant products, \nservices and systems139. Blockchain systems in \nmany cases will be complementary or \nintegrated with legacy IT systems currently \nused by industries, businesses and SMEs.

In many cases, a \nblockchain will perform specific functions for \nexample for data registry or automatic processing \nin coordination with other systems which will \nperform other functions that a blockchain is \nsimply not designed or useful for. \n \nNonetheless, another trend concerns the possible \nintersection of Blockchain with other key \ndigital technologies in the industrial / non-\nfinancial context, such as Internet of Things \n(IoT), data analytics, cloud computing, \nartificial intelligence, robotics, or additive \nmanufacturing. Consider for instance ongoing \napplications for food processing and distribution, \nin which a blockchain records information about a \nproduct\u2019s origin, production process, quality or \nexpiry dates, which is scanned through a \ncombination of smart tags, IoT sensors and \nmobile phones. Future scenarios could even \nforesee Blockchain as the basis of a decentralised \ndata infrastructure towards a convergence \necosystem. In such scenarios, data is seamlessly \ncollected by IoT devices, then authenticated, \nvalidated and encrypted on a shared ledger, and \nfinally automatically processed through a \ncombination of smart contracts, decentralised \ncomputation and machine learning140. \n \nIn terms of its supporting ecosystems, the \nBlockchain space is increasingly populated \nby multistakeholder and cross-sectoral \nengagement. Interest from established \ncompanies and industries, technology vendors, \nacademia, venture capital firms, startups, among \nothers, are translated into a number of private \nconsortia like R3 (mostly financial), Hyperledger \nand Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (broader in \nscope), among others smaller or sector-specific. \nFor many organisations, consortia could offer an \naccessible and low-risk entry to better understand \nBlockchain technology, to collaborate with other \ncompanies in similar issues, and eventually to \nimplement Blockchain based systems and develop \n                                                          \n140 Outlier, The Convergence Ecosystem: Convergence 2.0 \nBuilding the Decentralised Future, 2018 \n<https://outlierventures.io/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/03/OV_TCESR_001_SCREEN_med.pdf>. \ntheir own pilots141. Collaboration between \nconsortia members is a positive sign for the \nBlockchain space, although robust governance \nmechanisms are needed to incentivize open \nsharing and exchange of results often between \ncompetitors. \n \nThe development of the Blockchain space \ncould also be connected to broader capacity \nbuilding and knowledge sharing activities. In \nthis sense, it would be beneficial to build on \nexisting European programmes for digitising \nindustry and SMEs, in order to bridge current \ngaps between on one hand the Blockchain \nspace, and on the other hand companies \npotentially interested in developing it but still \nonly partially engaged or not engaged at all. \nFunding mechanisms like SME Instrument, \nongoing startup and entrepreneur networks, or \nsupporting initiatives like digital innovation hubs, \ncompetence centres, and incubators/accelerators \ncould be further connected to experimentation \nand piloting on Blockchain. \n \nFor instance, in innovation hubs and spaces in \ngeneral companies could learn more about the \nmaturity of the technology, associated costs, \ncompatibility with legacy systems, potential new \nbusiness models under decentralised, \ncollaborative or peer-to-peer logic, early impact \nassessment, and also very importantly to \nexperiment through pilots in possible collaboration \nwith other companies. This would be particularly \nuseful for SMEs which struggle to develop their \nassessments over benefits and challenges of \ndigital technologies\n142\n. \n \n                                                          \n141 Peter Gratzke, David Schatsky and Eric Piscini, \u2018Banding \nTogether for Blockchain: Does It Make Sense for Your Company \nto Join a Consortium?\u2019, Deloitte, 16 August 2017 \n<https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/signals-for-\nstrategists/emergence-of-blockchain-consortia.html>. \n \n142 European Commission, Roundtable on Digitising European \nIndustry Working Group 1 Digital Innovation Hubs: \nMainstreaming Digital Innovation Across All Sectors Final \nVersion, 2017 \n<https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/dei_working\n_group1_report_dec2016_v1.2.pdf>.

They could \nprovide companies access to robust regulatory \nand supervisory guidance which could be adapted \nto their particular needs, while also assessing \ncommercial viability and building potential \ncollaborations with other companies. \n \nBy engaging directly with the companies, policy \nmakers could also expand their in-depth \nknowledge not only of the technology but also \nassociated economic and social conditions. It \ncould potentially improve the quality and speed of \npolicy responses, and provide more regulatory \ncertainties for companies. Such inner insights \nmight also prove crucial to put forward \nregulatory approaches that could greatly \ninfluence the Blockchain space in the near \nfuture. Several options are possible, for instance \ndynamic co-regulation that gathers together a \ndiversity of stakeholders including Blockchain \ncompanies, industry and SMEs representatives, \nthink tanks, academia and research centres, \nand/or the redrawing of regulatory boundaries \n                                                          \n143 FCA / Financial Conduct Authority, Regulatory Sandbox \nLessons Learned Report, 2017 \n<https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/research/regulatory-\nsandbox-lessons-learned-report>. \n144 Australian Securities and Investments Commission, \nRetaining ASIC \u2019 S Fintech Licensing Exemption, 2017 \n<http://download.asic.gov.au/media/4570456/cp297-\npublished-12-december-2017.pdf>. \n145 Chamber of Digital Commerce, Global Regulatory Sandbox \nReview: An Overview on the Impact, Challenges , and Benefits \nof Regulatory FinTech Sandboxes, 2017 \n<https://digitalchamber.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/11/Regulatory-Sandbox-Review_Nov-\n21-2017_2.pdf>.  \ninformed by fitness checks or reviews taking into \naccount particularities of Blockchain technology146. \n \n5.2. New Business and Economic Models \n \nBlockchain based systems are developed \naccording to a peer-to-peer logic in which people \nand organisations can exchange goods, services \nand information without the need of central \nauthorities to verify identity, validate transactions \nor enforce commitments, or at least by removing \nthe need of many intermediaries as it happens \ntoday. At a first level, it may enable gains in \nefficiency and lowering of costs for \ncompanies and organisations, by allowing for \nfaster transactions disseminated and \nsynchronised digitally across a number of \ndifferent but fewer parties. \n \nAt a second level, such technologies could \npotentially introduce major changes on today's \nmainstream ways of extracting and delivering \nvalue in business and industry. One of the \ncrucial points in digitalisation strategies not \nexclusive to Blockchain but common to other \ndigital technologies is precisely the creation of \nnew services to new clients and markets.  \n  \nAs timestamped, shared and immutable \ndatabases operating in a distributed network, \nBlockchain and other DLTs could be a backbone \nfor new digital transactions between \neconomic agents, such as producers, \nmanufacturers, distributors, consumers, and so on. \nFor instance, keeping track of data about a car's \nuse and lifecycle, such as mileage, mobility \npatterns, or maintenance checks, could be used to \noffer new services like pay-per-use, short-term \ninsurances or other liability schemes, energy \npackages, among others. Or having a unique and \nreconciled registry of intellectual property rights \nfor any type of products, goods and digital \ncontent (design files, music, art, etc.) could enable \nnew licences and distribution networks, establish \nagreements in a more global scale, or simplify \n                                                          \n146 Julie Maupin, \u2018Mapping the Global Legal Landscape of \nBlockchain Technologies\u2019, SSRN, 2017, 1\u201315 \n<https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=293007\n7>.

This situation ends up creating data \nsilos with associated high costs of reconciliation, \nmismatch or incompatibility when organisations \nneed to exchange information with each other147. \n \nData-driven economies, however, may further \npush businesses and companies to rethink their \ncentralised logic based on closed boundaries and \nmove towards opening up their internal assets \nand integrate them into open ecosystems with \nexternal partners, customers and other players\n148\n. \nThe new logic here would be around collaboration, \ntransparency and sharing through secure \nchannels.

On the other hand, \nefficiency and productivity gains derive not solely \nfrom faster and cheaper end-to-end completion \nof tasks or processes.

Registering, sharing and \nsynchronising data through a Blockchain across a \ndistributed network can indeed disintermediate \nmany of these tasks so far executed by central \nauthorities or third parties. In certain scenarios \nmany traditional or incumbent companies or \norganisations could see a decline of usual \nmarkets, competition models and revenue \nstreams, or ultimately the dilution of their main \nproduct, service or business model.  \n \nBut the deployment of such technologies could \nalso allow for the creation of more diverse \nsources of creation of value, revenue distribution \nand overall re-balancing of asymmetric \nrelationships between economic actors. \nDisintermediation could also mean spurring more \ndynamic models in which many different actors, \nindividual or collective, can create, sell, buy or get \ncompensated for their digital assets, by making \nuse of accessible, secure and authenticated \nBlockchain based databases keeping track of \nevery transaction. \n \nIt could foster new forms of micro \nentrepreneurship, in which creating a business \naround specific functions, skills, ideas and \nknowledge is easier, faster and cheaper. This \ncould prove potentially valuable in social \ninnovation or social economy initiatives by \nenabling the development of businesses for local \nor niche markets. Or it could also lower barriers of \nentry for small businesses for instance by \nlowering costs through automation of most \ntransactions with their producers, suppliers or \ndistributors through smart contracts, or by \nallowing for attracting new and more clients \nthrough micropayments, or by accessing \nalternative ways of crowdfunding such as Initial \nCoin Offerings (more on this topic below). \n \nMoving from centralised to decentralised forms of \neconomic organisation should not be taken as a \ngiven or inevitable. There are a number of \nchallenges that don\u2019t stem only from the \nresistance, reluctance or inertia of organisations \nmostly relying on centralised structures and \nmodes of operation. \n \nConsidering Blockchain as an early stage \ntechnology, the novelty and uncertainty around its \nvery basic features raises a number of questions \nover broader consequences. For example, the \nproliferation of parallel or unregulated \neconomies in the future, with little connections \nwith mainstream economies, could be more \nsignificant than current pockets of criminal \nactivity, frauds or scams. Blockchain properties \ncould enable the spread of transnational, non-\nterritorial and permissionless innovation for \nentrepreneurs and business operations that \ncircumvents any regulatory or political \nsupervision, for instance in the form of 'crypto-\nanarchies' or 'cryptosecession'\n151\n potentially \ndefined as political-economic ruptures. \n \nBut probably one of the most potentially ground-\nbreaking developments orbits around the notion \nof 'tokens' within present and future \nscenarios of 'cryptoeconomies'. In simple \nterms, 'cryptoeconomy'\n152\n is a emergent field of \nstudy which is rethinking terms such as 'currency', \n'coins' or more generally, 'tokens' or 'digital \nassets'\n153\n. \n \nSo far most discussions are focused on the \nissuing of cryptocurrencies as the main operating \nand incentive mechanism for networks such as \nBitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple, EOS, IOTA, Monero and \nmany others, estimated at more than 1500\n154\n. \nThis is in fact a first definition of anything \n'cryptoeconomic'\n155\n. It refers to decentralised \ncryptographic protocols used in public blockchains \n(such as the Proof-of-Work) as the technical basis \nfor the economic incentives for participants to \ncontinue to run the network (for instance getting \npayed or rewarded with more cryptocurrencies). \n                                                          \n151 Trent J Macdonald, Darcy W E Allen and Jason Potts, \n\u2018Blockchains and the Boundaries of Self-Organized Economies: \nPredictions for the Future of Banking\u2019, in Banking Beyond \nBanks and Money, ed. by Paolo Tasca and others (Heidelberg: \nSpringer, 2016), pp. 279\u201396 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-\n319-42448-4>. \n152 Marc Pilkington, \u2018Blockchain Technology: Principles and \nApplications\u2019, in Research Handbook on Digital \nTransformations, ed. by F.

It can be \nconsidered as an alternative source of funding \nakin to crowdfunding, so far with considerable \nsuccess for raising money (reported $8.84 billion \ndollars raised as of February 2018\n156\n). Here the \nadvantages and disadvantages of ICOs\n157\n are still \nvery much wrapped up in regulatory uncertainty, \nsuspicions of fraud and scams, or actual value in \nbootstrapping a network or a company through \nrewarding or incentivising the contribution of \ndifferent players. \n \nWhat\u2019s more important here is to go beyond a \npure 'financial' connotation. A 'currency' or more \ngenerally a 'token' in a Blockchain system can be \nsimply understood as a multipurpose unit of value \nused in particular business models or economic \nsystems\n158\n.  \n \nFor instance, in different Blockchain systems a \ntoken can give special access of a product (for \ninstance cloud storage), represent voting rights \nwithin a group or community, and/or compensate \nparticipants for their time, work, reviews or other \ncontributions, everything within the network or \ncompany. In this sense, it can be a mechanism for \norganising and coordinating behaviour, \ninteractions or relationships between participants \nor users, that is, distributed economies within \ngroups or communities under shared goals.  \n \nIn a 'crypto' or 'Blockchain economy', it's \nconceivable that a person, group or organisation \ncould create their own tokens (or currencies) \nbased on protocols that govern the development, \nproduction, distribution and use of goods and \nservices, maybe even unconstrained by \ngeographic and political frontiers\n159\n.

Trust and Decentralised Governance  \n \nBlockchain is often heralded as a 'trustless' \ntechnology or as a 'trust machine'. Such terms, \nhowever, have caused misunderstandings over \nhow this technology could reframe what 'trust' \nmeans among individuals, groups, institutions or \norganisations. Generally speaking, Blockchain's \nparticular combination of peer-to-peer networks, \ncryptographic techniques, consensus protocols and \ndistributed data storage could allow for exchange \nof digital data with fewer to non-existent central \nauthorities or intermediaries.  \n \nTraditionally third parties like financial \ninstitutions, governments, regulatory bodies \nor other commercial services verify or \nauthenticate most of current transactions. \nThey act as intermediaries that warrant for \nexample that product suppliers or distributors are \nwho they claim to be and keep their end of the \ncontract (delivery and agreed budget), and if \nnecessary, provide compensation or legal appeal \nin case of mistakes, disputes or unlawful \nactivities. Companies rely on such organisations to \nprovide 'trusted' mechanisms to conduct their \nbusinesses on a daily basis, with associated costs \ncovering the execution of those services, \nunforeseen mishaps, or enforcement of \ntransactions or agreements. \n \nIn Blockchain architectures third party \nverification could be replaced by consensus \nmechanisms that verify the authenticity of \ntransactions across a distributed network161. \n                                                                                    \nMountain View CA, 26-29 January, 2015 \n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lw3s7iGUXQ>. \n160 Consider for instance CryptoKitties \n(<https://www.cryptokitties.co/>) as one of the first (and \nplayful) examples of a digital good turned rapidly into a scarce \nand valuable commodity. See Joseph Hincks, \u2018Introducing \n\u201cCryptoKitties,\u201d the New Digital Pets Taking Ethereum by \nStorm\u2019, Fortune, 4 December 2017 \n<http://fortune.com/2017/12/04/blockchain-cryptokitties-\nethereum/>. \n161 Davidson, Sinclair and De Filippi, Primavera and Potts. \n81 \n \n \nThis technology could offer a number of \nadvantages for instance in terms of efficiency, \nsecurity, availability and data integrity in \ncomparison with current procedural, \norganisational and technological infrastructures \nrun by central bodies or a few third parties \nproviders\n162\n. \n \nProspects of disintermediation is particularly \nappealing in industrial sectors such as transports \nand logistics, which rely on global supply chains of \ndistant and untrusting players including \nmanufacturers, shipping lines, freight forwarders, \nport and terminal operators, and customs \nauthorities. Access to a transparent and secure \nrecord could reduce time and costs associated \nwith inaccurate and inconsistent data between all \nparties, and ultimately help to prevent frauds, \nlosses or duplications. \n \nIt is in this particular sense that 'trust' could be \nreassigned or displaced from intermediaries \nto code or software deployment on a \nBlockchain. Due to its particular features, a \nBlockchain is an encrypted, shared and \ntamper proof ledger which is designed to \nstand as a 'trusted' data source for all \nstakeholders. From one side of the spectrum \ncloser to cyber-libertarian aspirations, it could be \nargued that trust, or rather lack of trust in people \nand organisations mainly seen as fallible and \ncorruptible, could be ultimately replaced in favour \nof trust in technical architectures that could \nexecute autonomously and  neutrally all \ntransactions. Such views, however, conflict with a \nmore comprehensive understanding of the specific \nworkings of Blockchain as a technology and its \ninterplay with economic, cultural, social, political \nand institutional dimensions163.  \n \nA first assumption is that users or companies \nneed to 'trust' the exactness of Blockchain's \ntechnical features based on decentralisation, \nreplication, transparency, timestamping, \nimmutability, digital keys and smart contracts. \nHowever, among other issues previously \n                                                          \n162 Bill Briggs, Tech Trends 2016, Deloitte University Press, \n2016. \n163 See for instance ongoing research <https://blockchain-\nsociety.science/>. Ruth Catlow and others, Artists Re:Thinking \nThe Blockchain (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2018). \nmentioned in the report, for example high \nconcentration or dependency on mining pools for \nBlockchain platforms running Proof-of-Work \nmechanisms may endanger its decentralised \nnature and allow for potential collusions or \nattacks. \n \nWhen it comes to smart contracts for instance, \nongoing discussions raise potential problems \naround their 'trustless' character. So far major \nlacunas between legal language and technical \nlanguage of smart contracts require (or potentially \nwill always require) the presence or intervention \nof lawyers and other legal experts with both an \noverall and precise knowledge of relevant legal \nframeworks164. Furthermore, a part of current \nsmart contracts were found not to be 'trustless' in \nthe sense they require trust in other third parties \nthat could change unilaterally the program that \nenforces the agreement, putting in question the \nfeature of immutability165. Another potential \nthreat to 'trust' concerns the possibility to change \nthe status of a Blockchain by majority and 'fork' \nor split it. Such 'forks' are usually very contentious \ndecisions within public blockchains such as Bitcoin \nand Ethereum, precisely because they call into \nquestion 'trust' in a record that is designed to be \nimmutable. \n \nBut more interestingly, all these issues bring to \nlight that Blockchain systems ultimately rely on \nthe consensus or interactions among a set of \nstakeholders involved in its design and \ndeployment, that is, developers/coders, miners, \nvalidators or other participants (depending if it is \na public or private Blockchain), all with a role to \nplay or decision-making power. \n \nBlockchain's technical features can't \nestablish by themselves all the intricate \nterms through which different parties trust \n                                                          \n164 Firas Al Khalil and others, Trust in Smart Contracts Is a \nProcess, as Well, Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Including \nSubseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture \nNotes in Bioinformatics), 2017 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-\n3-319-70278-0_32>. \n165 Michael Fr\u00f6wis and Rainer B\u00f6hme, \u2018In Code We Trust?\u2019, in \nESORICS 2017, DPM 2017, CBT 2017: Data Privacy \nManagement, Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain Technology, \n2017, pp. 357\u201372 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-\n67816-0_20>. \n82 \n \n \nand engage with each other166. This happens \nbecause all technical systems are designed, \ndeployed and used by individuals, groups, \ncompanies and other organisations, that is, they \ndon't exist in a vacuum protected from a myriad \nof other factors. \n \nPotential scenarios of Blockchain as a 'trust \nmachine' don't mean the total dissipation of \nintermediaries and/or absence of \ngovernance. Although often fraught with \ncumbersome, costly and corrupt processes, third-\nparties, government, or other central bodies still \nplay a vital role for instance in defining equal \nconditions for participation in society and \neconomy, deciding on responsibility and liability, \nenforcing rules and settling disputes, or providing \nguarantees and protection under the law. \n \nInstead the discussion should focus on the \nconcrete conditions for decentralised, \nhorizontal and open forms of coordination \nbetween individuals, groups and companies, \nwhich may require in most instances a rethinking \nof traditional, vertical and hierarchical models. \nGovernance mechanisms capable of organising \nindividual and collective interactions will always \nbe essential to the running of any Blockchain, no \nmatter its position closer to public or private \narchitectures167. \n \nPublic and/or permissionless blockchains may \nsometimes be misconstrued as purely \ndisorganised, chaotic and ineffective given the \nopen and informal character of its communities. \nStill, it can\u2019t be denied that free, libre and open \nsource software (or FLOSS) communities168, \nsimilar in many aspects to those at the core of \npublic blockchains, have developed and continue \nto enable high quality (and some might say \n                                                          \n166 Florian Hawlitschek, Benedikt Notheisen and Timm Teubner, \n\u2018The Limits of Trust-Free Systems: A Literature Review on \nBlockchain Technology and Trust in the Sharing Economy\u2019, \nElectronic Commerce Research and Applications, 29 (2018), \n50\u201363 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.elerap.2018.03.005>. \n167 Don Tapscott and Alex Tapscott, Realizing the Potential of \nBlockchain: A Multistakeholder Approach to the Stewardship of \nBlockchain and Cryptocurrencies, Whitepaper, 2017 \n<https://www.weforum.org/whitepapers/realizing-the-potential-\nof-blockchain>. \n168 Georg von Krogh and Eric von Hippel, \u2018The Promise of \nResearch on Open Source Software\u2019, Management Science, \n52.7 (2007), 1\u201313 \n<http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.1060.0611ec>.  \nthrough more lean, secure and productive \nprocesses) products and operating systems \nalready running a considerable part of current \nservers, desktops and smartphones. It can be \nargued that for instance Bitcoin and Ethereum \ncommunities, working mostly through \nvoluntary, grassroots and open processes, \nhave created the more successful Blockchain \narchitectures to date. \n \nAlso self-organisation in such distributed networks \nturns out to be more complex. In fact discussions \nover the importance of governance within \npublic blockchains communities are ongoing, \nand a number of proposals or protocols are \nunder development169. Taking the example of \ncurrent debates around \u2018on-chain\u2019 or \u2018off-chain\u2019 \ngovernance, there is a lively exchange of \narguments over how to at the same time preserve \nand improve the delicate balance between often \nconflicting roles of involved stakeholders like \ntoken or coin holders, miners and users170. Some \nare more in favour of formalised and automatic \nexecution of rules embedded in the protocol itself, \nwhich might help to reach consensus more quickly \nand avoid constant deadlocks or forks. Others are \nmore wary of potential power imbalances arising \nfrom such \u2018on-chain\u2019 mechanisms, and point \ntowards more contextual and tacit governance \nprocesses171. Such \u2018off-chain\u2019 mechanisms relate \nin a certain way with how governance and \nleadership in open source communities has been \nshown to emerge from a fluid combination of \npersonal motivations, meritocratic pursuit of \ntechnical proficiency, shared values of \naccountability, transparency and openness, \norganisation-building behaviours, and overall \ncollective practices over time (e.g. online \ndiscussions, meetings, conferences, etc.)172. \n \n                                                          \n169 See for instance <http://backfeed.cc/> \n170 Rachel Rose O\u2019Leary, \u2018Polkadot\u2019s Plan for Governing a \nBlockchain of Blockchains\u2019, Coindesk, 22 March 2018 \n<https://www.coindesk.com/polkadots-radical-plan-governing-\nblockchain-blockchains/>. \n171 Vlad Zamfir, \u2018Against on-Chain Governance\u2019, Medium, 1 \nDecember 2017 <https://medium.com/@Vlad_Zamfir/against-\non-chain-governance-a4ceacd040ca>. \n172 Siobh\u00e1n O Mahony and Fabrizio Ferraro, \u2018The Emergence of \nGovernance in an Open Source Community\u2019, The Academy of \nManagement Journal, 50.5 (2007), 1079\u20131106. Gabriella \nColeman, Coding Freedom: The Ethics and Aesthetics of \nHacking (New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 2012). \n83 \n \n \nDespite such noteworthy debates, public \nblockchain communities still need to grapple with \nunderlying conditions and realities. It is a \ndistributed system based on consensus through \ncryptoeconomic incentives, that is, based on the \nalignment of rational agents following their own \nbest individual interest, which may raise concerns \nover an illusion of egalitarianism based on a \nmajority rule. \n \nHuman and social coordination, however, is much \nmore complex in reality, and power dynamics play \na central role through informal and sometimes \ninvisible alignments of interest between \nindividuals or groups, or in the Blockchain space, \nthe influence of core developers or members of \nthe community in steering debates or major \ndecisions. Use of any technology also needs to be \nconsidered in relation to inclusion and diversity \nwhen it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, \ngeographical origin, education, and other social \nand cultural capital imbalances. Claims for \negalitarian and meritocratic levelling of the \nplaying field rarely match a levelling of \nopportunities to access173.  \n \nIn private and/or permissioned blockchains, \ngovernance is usually implemented through \nmore formal mechanisms and approaches, at \nleast partly due to its very design. In such \narchitectures, participation is restricted to trusted \nnodes and/or members which clear and explicit \npermission to access specific features or data. At \nthe protocol level, rules about who does \nwhat and when (users, validators, \nregulators, \u2026) are defined and each \nparticipant performs its assigned role. In this \nsense, private blockchains carry out a distinctive \nmode of decentralised governance between \nindividuals, groups and companies by allowing \nthem to interact more openly with each other but \nunder specific boundaries. \n \nMany companies and businesses are more \ninclined to deploy private blockchains precisely \n                                                          \n173 Susana Nascimento and Alexandre Polvora, \u2018Opening Up \nTechnologies to the Social: Between Interdisciplinarity and \nCitizen Participation\u2019, Design Issues, 29.4 (2013), 31\u201340. \nSusana Nascimento and Alexandre P\u00f3lvora, \u2018Maker Cultures \nand the Prospects for Technological Action\u2019, Science and \nEngineering Ethics, 2016, 1\u201320 \n<http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11948-016-9796-8>. \nbecause it allows in their view for more stable, \nclosed and verifiable governance and its \nassociated mechanisms for identity management, \ndata rectification and attribution of responsibility. \nIt may disentangle for instance a number of \nconcerns when using this technology, namely \nconformity with current regulatory frameworks for \ndaily business operations such as protection of \npersonal data, validation of electronic signatures \nor digital certificates, or management of \nelectronic document storage and archiving174. \n \nPrivate consortia such as Hyperledger may \nalso offer a perceived balance between open \nsource collaborative efforts between its \nmembers and the assurance of a formal \ngovernance framework, including a core team, \ngovernance board, a technical committee, an \nadvisory board with an agreed set of \nresponsibilities, procedures for decision-making \nand codes of conduct. It can be argued if this type \nof decentralised governance follows too closely \nconventional centralised systems, and it may miss \nin the end one of the major advantages of more \nopen decentralised governance, that is, the full \ntransparency and resulting enhanced trust \nbetween all participants. \n \nWhatever might be the exact configurations of \ngovernance in different Blockchain architectures, \nmore public, closed or hybrid, there are increasing \nsigns of organisational change and new market \ndynamics brought by decentralised forms of \nsocioeconomic coordination\n175\n. Though it is still \nunclear its potential wide impact, more open and \nhorizontal Blockchain-enabled governance might \nshift power dynamics between stakeholders in \nmany sectors\n176\n.  At a nearer future, the \nboundaries might revolve around new types of \neconomic and social institutions executing \nBlockchain rule-systems like smart contracts \ntowards polycentric and common pool resources \ngovernance. \n                                                          \n174 Marcella Atzori, \u2018Blockchain Governance and the Role of \nTrust Service Providers: The TrustedChain Network\u2019, SSRN \nElectronic Journal, 2017 \n<http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2972837>. \n175 Paolo Tasca and others, Banking Beyond Banks and Money \n(Heidelberg: Springer, 2016). \n176 Aaron Wright and Primavera De Filippi, \u2018Decentralized \nBlockchain Technology and the Rise of Lex Cryptographia\u2019, \n2015, 58. \n84 \n \n \n \nFor instance at a first level companies and \nbusinesses might start adopting Blockchain \nsystems to support more flat and collaborative \ninteractions and increase transparency and \naccountability.

The conditions \nfor enabling a data economy\n178\n is at the core of \nrecent and ongoing European regulatory initiatives \nwithin the Digital Single Market strategy, namely \nthe draft Regulation on a framework for the free \nflow of non-personal data in the EU\n179\n, the EU \nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\n180\n, and \nthe Regulation on electronic identification and \n                                                          \n177 William Mougayar, \u2018An Operational Framework for \nDecentralized Autonomous Organizations\u2019, 2015 \n<http://startupmanagement.org/2015/02/04/an-operational-\nframework-for-decentralized-autonomous-organizations/>; \nVitalik Buterin, \u2018DAOs, DACs, DAs and More: An Incomplete \nTerminology Guide\u2019, Ethereum Blog, 2014 \n<https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-\nmore-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/>. \n178 European Commission, Communication from the \nCommission to the European Parliament, the Council, Economic \nand Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: \nBuilding a European Data Economy, COM(2017) 9 Final, 2017 \n<https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-\nmarket/en/news/communication-building-european-data-\neconomy>. \n179 European Commission, Proposal for a Regulation of the \nEuropean Parliament and of the Council on a Framework for \nthe Free Flow of Non-Personal Data in the European Union, \nCOM(2017) 495, 2017 <https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-\nmarket/en/news/proposal-regulation-european-parliament-\nand-council-framework-free-flow-non-personal-data>. \n180 \u2018Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and \nof the Council of 27 April 2016 on the Protection of Natural \nPersons with Regard to the Processing of Personal Data and on \nthe Free Movement of Such Data, and Repealing Directive \n95/46/EC\u2019 <http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-\ncontent/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679>. \ntrust services for electronic transactions in the \ninternal market (eIDAS)\n181\n, among others\n182\n. From \nhere derives the potential of Blockchain and other \nDLTs as emerging decentralised data \narchitectures that could support the execution of a \nnumber of principles under certain conditions. \n \nBlockchain and other DLTs operate through a \ndistributed network of multiple nodes or \nparticipants. Its feature of replication means each \nnode has an updated and authenticated copy of \nthe ledger or record. Unlike centralised systems, \nthere is no single point of failure. So even in \nmultiple nodes are disconnected or break down, \ndata will continue to be available throughout the \ndistributed network. This decentralised \narchitecture could fulfil the goals of data \nstorage, processing and availability of data \nacross Member States and between \nproviders and different IT environments, as \ndefined in the draft Regulation on free flow of \nnon-personal data. Moreover, data remains \navailable for regulatory control from public \nauthorities, or if necessary, under specific \nconditions of access for authorised participants in \nprivate and/or permissioned blockchains. \n \nWhen it comes to cybersecurity requirements that \napply to any industries and businesses storing and \nprocessing data, Blockchain and other DLTs \ncould offer resilient and secure \narchitectures. Its feature of immutability makes \nit very hard or nearly impossible to change data \nwithout detection, and that's mainly why \nBlockchain is being tested to verify for instance \nthe integrity of highly sensitive data in critical \nsystems, satellites, nuclear command and control \nsystems, or weapon systems. Blockchain's \npotential to enhance data integrity, however, is \nnot free of potential corruptions or problems. \nSources of vulnerability remain for instance on \npotential takeovers, manipulations or collusions in \n                                                          \n181 \u2018Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament \nand of the Council of 23 July 2014 on Electronic Identification \nand Trust Services for Electronic Transactions in the Internal \nMarket and Repealing Directive 1999/93/EC\u2019 <http://eur-\nlex.europa.eu/legal-\ncontent/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG>. \n182 See for instance upcoming revision of the legal framework \non ePrivacy: European Commission, Proposal for a Regulation \non Privacy and Electronic Communications, 2017 \n<https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposal-\nregulation-privacy-and-electronic-communications>. \n85 \n \n \npublic blockchains (51% attack), censures or \ninterventions by small groups in private \nblockchains, or in the compromise, theft or loss of \npublic and private keys. \n \nOverall, data integrity is also connected to the \naccuracy, consistency or validity of data \nthroughout its whole life cycle\n183\n. For instance, \norganisations need to pay close attention to \nthe quality of the data being entered, \nprocessed and stored on a Blockchain, that is, \nif data is incorrect, invalid or complete. This \ntechnology is only records, verifies and encrypts \nthe data as it is introduced and by consensus of \ninvolved participants or nodes, with no guarantees \nor fact checking about its veracity. \n \nStability and continuity of Blockchain \ntechnical architectures might also be a \nproblem. For instance, public and/or \npermissionless blockchains depend on the \ndistributed effort of developers and miners which \ncan simply stop working in a particular Blockchain \nfor whatever reason and/or move to another \nsystem ('fork'). If this happens, the records from \nthe previous system may no longer be preserved, \nupdated or maintained and create confusion \nthroughout the network about the legitimate and \nnew version of the record. The same issue could \nhappen in private and/or permissioned blockchains \nwhen changes are introduced and decided by a \nrestricted number of core participants. \n \nOverall organisations need to invest their \nresources to establish trusted digital \nrepositories and guarantee additional technical, \npolicy and institutional capacity for proper \narchival storage, data management, access, \nand overall preservation of records\n184\n. \n \n                                                          \n183 Victoria Louise Lemieux, \u2018In Blockchain We Trust?

By design, a \nBlockchain only records a cryptographic hash (or \n'digital fingerprint') of the transaction, date and \ntime, plus the public keys of the involved parties. \nPersonal data, like names, addresses, telephones, \nlocation, etc., is not publicly accessible so it \nprecludes direct identification185. At its minimum \nsuch mechanisms offer pseudonymisation and not \nfull anonymisation, so in most cases they would \nneed additional layers of encryption and/or \nobfuscation in order to conceal details about the \ntransactions (solutions under development are \ndiscussed in the following sub-chapter)\n186\n. If \nproperly designed depending on the needs of \norganisations, Blockchain systems could \npotentially enable decentralised and privacy-\nfriendly solutions. \n \nIn a Blockchain system people, any type of \nencrypted data (identity documents, health \nrecords, transactions between IoT devices, \npayments, transfer of ownership, etc.) can be \nrecorded, validated and transmitted according to \nspecific rules for access. That is, it's possible to \ngive authorisation to information only to specific \nor trusted parties, or to revoke access in specific \ntimes. It could enable faster and more secure \ndata management processes for both \nindividuals and organisations, and overall a \ngreater control over the disclosure and \nselective sharing of data. \n \nFor instance, Blockchain could be at the basis of \ndistributed identity and authentication systems \npotentially in line with the eIDAS Regulation which \nforesees the use of electronic identification (eID) \nand electronic Trust Services (eTS), namely \n                                                          \n185 Deloitte, \u2018Blockchain from a Perspective of Data Protection \nLaw: A Brief Introduction to Data Protection Ramifications\u2019 \n<https://www2.deloitte.com/dl/en/pages/legal/articles/blockchai\nn-datenschutzrecht.html>. \n186 Primavera De Filippi, \u2018The Interplay Between \nDecentralization and Privacy: The Case of Blockchain \nTechnologies\u2019, Journal of Peer Production, 2016 \n<http://peerproduction.net/issues/issue-9-alternative-\ninternets/peer-reviewed-papers/the-interplay-between-\ndecentralization-and-privacy-the-case-of-blockchain-\ntechnologies/>. \n86 \n \n \nelectronic signatures, electronic seals, time stamp, \nelectronic delivery service and website \nauthentication, to enable secure and cross-border \nelectronic interactions between businesses, \ncitizens and public authorities. Blockchain could \nalso further the application of data portability as \nstipulated in GDPR by allowing for selective, \nseamless and secure flows of data between IT \nenvironments run by individuals, companies, or \nservice providers. \n \nDecentralised solutions for these purposes are \nstill currently under development, and subject to \ncritique\n187\n. But there are several ongoing projects \nand initiatives working for example on new \nregimes of citizen-controlled and self-\nsovereign digital identity\n188\n based on \ndistributed, open and modular architectures \nfor managing online identity and data in real-time \nand confidential ways. Such regimes could also \nenhance GDPR's objectives of strengthening \ncitizen's fundamental rights over their personal \ndata and simplify the rules for companies in order \nto achieve a level playing field. \n \nParadoxically the same decentralised and \ncryptographic protocols used in Blockchain to \npotentially enhance data protection could also \ncompromise the rights of privacy and personal \ndata, as discussed in more detail in the next sub-\nchapter. To be noted though that uncertainties \nand risks around data management are not \nexclusive to Blockchain but are in fact very much \npresent in ongoing discussions over the use of \nartificial intelligence, big data or in general data \nanalytics for large-scale and automated \nprocessing, classification and access to personal \ndata\n189\n. \n \n \n                                                          \n187 Arvind Narayanan, Vincent Toubiana, and others, \u2018A Critical \nLook at Decentralized Personal Data Architectures\u2019, 2012 \n<http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.4503>. \n188 John Thornhill, \u2018Reclaiming Europe\u2019s Digital Sovereignty, \nPodcast with Francesca Bria\u2019, Financial Times, 25 October \n2017 <https://www.ft.com/content/f096bcf6-87d5-4023-\na9b5-73ae847076b2>.; Tom Symons and others, \u2018Me, My \nData and I: The Future of the Personal Data Economy\u2019, 2017, \n88 <https://decodeproject.eu/publications/me-my-data-and-\nithe-future-personal-data-economy>. \n189 Tal Z Zarsky, \u2018Incompatible: The GDPR in the Age of Big \nData\u2019, Iowa Law Review, 102.2 (2017), 651\u2013707 \n<http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/ajicl.2011.0005>. \n5.5. Dealing with Privacy and Transparency \n \nOne of the most pressing issues for data in \nBlockchain concerns possible incompatibilities of \nits decentralised and cryptographic protocols in \nregard to privacy and personal data, namely in the \nframework of GDPR which becomes enforceable \nfrom 25 May 2018\n190\n. There are a number of \nissues that still remain uncertain or unresolved for \nthe time being, which may further complicate how \norganisations and businesses can make decisions \non their data policies and strategies. \n \nAs GDPR only applies to personal data, one key \nelement is to determine which type of data stored \non a Blockchain qualifies as personal data. On \npublic blockchains for instance, transactions are \nencrypted and linked to a set of public and \nprivate keys owned by specific participants. So \nthe Blockchain doesn't record specific elements of \nparticipants' identities, and instead just the public \nkeys of the sender and recipient, the date and \ntime (timestamping), and the cryptographic hash \n(or 'digital fingerprint') of the transaction content \n(payment, transfer of ownership, medical records, \na piece of art, etc.).  \n \nHowever, this cryptographic protocol doesn't \nguarantee complete anonymisation, in the sense \nthat records of transactions could be still be \ntraced back to individuals. Instead, encryption is \nconsidered a pseudonymisation technique \nunder the EU data protection regime\n191\n. Following \nthis high standard for anonymisation, encrypted \ndata on a Blockchain will most probably be \nconsidered as personal data for the purposes of \nGDPR. \n \nIn addition, while they don't allow for direct \nidentification, public keys can be still be \nconnected with additional information that \nwill allow to pinpoint an individual or \n                                                          \n190 Winston Maxwell and John Salmon, A Guide to Blockchain \nand Data Protection, 2017; Mich\u00e8le Fink, \u2018Blockchains and Data \nProtection in the European Union\u2019, Max Planck Institute for \nInnovation and Competition Research Paper No. 18-01, 18.1 \n(2017), 1\u201330 <http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3080322>. \n191 \u2018Article 29 Working Party, Opinion 05/2014 on \nAnonymisation Techniques, 0829/14/EN WP216\u2019, 10 April \n2014 <http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-\n29/documentation/opinion-\nrecommendation/files/2014/wp216_en.pdf>. \n87 \n \n \ncompany, for instance when a public key is re-\nused and then certain IP addresses are \nrecognised, when keys are stolen or hacked, or \nwhen identity is requested by central authorities \nin the context of Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and \nAML (Anti-Money Laundering) regulation). In these \nterms, public keys are pseudononymous data and \nwill be presumably considered as personal data \nunder GDPR. A strong signal to this argument also \ncomes from the case Patrick Breyer v \nBundesrepublik Deutschland on 19 October 2016, \nwhich classified dynamic IP addresses as personal \ndata. Dynamic IP addresses, that is, addresses \nassigned to computers when connected to a \nnetwork, could be considered personal data even \nif additional data able to identify an individual is \nonly in possession of a third party (such as an \ninternet service provider).  \n \nOther features of Blockchain and other DLTs also \npose potential problems, such as decentralisation, \ntransparency, replication and immutability. In a \nbroad definition forgoing for a moment the \ndifferences between different architectures, a \nBlockchain is a chronological database in which \ndata is permanently recorded and shared across a \ndistributed network of nodes or computers. \n \nIn these decentralised systems, nodes or \nparticipants can be 'data controllers' \naccording to the GDPR lexicon when they upload \ndata into the Blockchain, or 'data processors' \nbecause they verify transactions and keep a \nfull copy of the Blockchain. It may be hard to \ndetermine not only the responsibilities for each \nnode or participant, but also to enforce \ncompliance throughout a network of multiple data \ncontrollers and processors across the world. To \ndetermine the location and identity of \ndecentralised nodes for jurisdiction purposes and \nthen compel them to comply won't be easy or \nstraightforward tasks. In a potentially global and \ncross-border environment run through Blockchain \nsystems, the applicability of data regulation might \nneed to be analysed depending on the transaction \nin question. This uncertainty does not offer, \nhowever, a clear background for companies and \nbusinesses to operate and may constitute \nadditional risks.  \n \nProbably of the one discussed issues concerns \npotential conflicts between Blockchain \nfeature of immutability and the GDPR right \nto data erasure, most known as 'the right to be \nforgotten'. By design particularly in public and \npermissionless Blockchains, the records of \ntransactions or in general data are very hard to \nchange or delete. Depending on the consensus \nmechanism in place, a majority of the nodes or \nparticipants need to agree and then implement \nthe changes across the whole network. The \npotential need to identify and contact all the \nnecessary nodes with a request to delete or even \nrectify data (right to amendment) might not be \nfeasible in reality. Also any changes in a \nsupposedly 'immutable' database may erode the \ntrust of participants in the Blockchain itself and \nlend it to suspicions of tamper-proofing and \ninterference. \n \nThere might be some flexibility in what constitutes \n'erasure'. It ultimately will depend on the \ninterpretation by data protection authorities in \nregard to what is technically (im)possible in \nBlockchain. In some instances irreversible \nencryption used in Blockchain, deleting a private \nkey, or restricted access mechanisms that make it \nno longer possible to view data might still be \nconsidered as erasure, despite the fact it won't be \nnot absolute deletion. \n \nNonetheless, a number of technical proposals are \nbeing developed with the explicit purpose of \nsolving such pressing issues. One possible solution \nis to store confidential, sensitive or personal \ndata 'off-chain' or in other databases. This data \nis linked to the Blockchain only through a hash \nreference or pointer, keeping access to the original \ndata in the other database restricted to \nauthorised parties. So in this case the Blockchain \nis more of an access-control manager\n192\n that \nprovides proof regarding the authenticity of the \ndata and overall preserves the privacy of \ntransaction details\n193\n. An example would be \nBlockchain systems managing patient medical \n                                                          \n192 Guy Zyskind, Oz Nathan and Alex Sandy Pentland, \n\u2018Decentralizing Privacy: Using Blockchain to Protect Personal \nData\u2019, Proceedings - 2015 IEEE Security and Privacy \nWorkshops, SPW 2015, 2015, 180\u201384 \n<http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SPW.2015.27>. \n193 See for example https://www.cambridge-\nblockchain.com/single-post/2016/08/09/Event-1 \n88 \n \n \nrecords but the records themselves would be \nstored in hospital or other third parties' databases. \n \nTo be compliant with GDPR, most companies \nwill most probably decide to move \npersonally identifiable data off the \nBlockchain and store in traditional \ndatabases. However, setting up and maintaining \nsuch databases or IT infrastructure can be \nexpensive, especially for smaller companies and \nstartups, also taking into account overall high \nstandards for data security\n194\n. Also such 'off-\nchain' solutions may hide potential corruptions or \nerrors in the diverse records maintained by \ncompanies or other parties outside of the \nBlockchain, and in the end compromise the \noriginal added value of a tamper-proof system \nwith a single and shared record. \n \nAnother problem is that moving public keys 'off-\nchain' is not a viable option because they are in \nfact an inextricable part of the validation process \nat least for public blockchains. So far there are no \nclear or mature GDPR-compliant solutions, but \npractitioners and experts are working on \nobfuscation techniques such as additional \nsignatures by multiple users using their private \nkeys and stealth addresses (one-time public \nkeys)\n195\n. Present cryptographic research is also \nlooking into other techniques such as zero \nknowledge proofs. It allows the validation of a \ntransaction between parties without the need to \nreveal information such as the addresses of the \nparties involved or the amounts. Such \ncryptographic tools are being tested as a \ncomplement to public and permissionless \nblockchains, and potentially guarantee at the \nsame time the use of personal (and private) data \non a Blockchain and the mathematical proof that \na transaction is authentic\n196\n. Other potential \nsolutions for anonymisation are being tested such \nas Multi-Party Computation (MPC) in which data \nand tasks are distributed through multiple parties \n                                                          \n194 Olga Kharif, \u2018Is Your Blockchain Business Doomed?\u2019, \nBloomberg, 22 March 2018 \n<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-22/is-\nyour-blockchain-business-doomed>. \n195 See for instance Monero protocol < https://getmonero.org/> \n196 See for instance Zcash \n<https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks.html> \nin a way that you can't single out specific details \nso it's still encrypted throughout the network\n197\n. \n \nAnother option being explored by a number of \ncompanies is to use private and/or \npermissioned blockchains. In these cases \naccess to data can be restricted to \nauthorised parties, which allows for limiting \nthe availability of personal, sensitive or \nprivate information to a case by case need. It \nmeans necessarily that specific participants or \nnodes get to decide the terms of access to data \nand even revise and change parts of the records, \nmaking them in reality intermediaries, third \nparties or arbitrators. One hand it may solve the \nissue of data privacy and facilitate identification \nof responsibility and compliance. But on the other \nhand such options may undermine data integrity \nand thus jeopardize one of the main benefits of \ndecentralised protocols such as in public \nblockchains. \n \nIf parts of the data is kept \u2018off-chain\u2019 and is \nsusceptible to be changed or altered by a core \ngroup as it happens in private blockchains, a \nnumber of questions may arise in terms of proper \ngovernance arrangements. Companies or \nbusinesses opting or developing such private \nand/or permissioned blockchains need to put in \nplace proper guidelines and mechanisms for \ndata ownership, access, encryption and \nsecurity, and storage which are agreed and \nacknowledged with all participants. Still \nsuspicions, attacks or threats can be more \nwidespread in Blockchains architectures which are \nnot completely transparent and available to all. \n \nSuch governance arrangements will be \nprobably the main basis to determine the \napplicability and compliance of Blockchain \nsystems when it comes to data protection \nregulation. In private blockchains responsibility \nmay fall on the core group of organisations \nrunning it, while in public blockchains the situation \nis more unclear\n198\n. As described above, many \n                                                          \n197 Andy Greenberg, \u2018MIT\u2019s Bitcoin-Inspired \u201cEnigma\u201d Lets \nComputers Mine Encrypted Data\u2019, Wired, 30 June 2015 \n<https://www.wired.com/2015/06/mits-bitcoin-inspired-\nenigma-lets-computers-mine-encrypted-data/>. \n198 David Meyer, \u2018Blockchain Technology Is on a Collision \nCourse with EU Privacy Law\u2019, International Association of \n89 \n \n \ntechnical solutions are being developed but \nare not mature enough to guarantee full \nanonymity for instance. More research is needed \non how to conciliate Blockchain features \nconcretely with the principles set out by regulation \nsuch as GDPR. This interconnection is not easy \nalso considering the gaps and discrepancies \nbetween technical and legal terms. \n \nIn general organisations should perform \nthrough risk assessments to their data \nframeworks, taking into account that at least \nsome data verified and stored on a Blockchain \ncould be considered personal data. Of course this \nassessment can be further complicated by the \ncustomisable and open-ended character of most \navailable Blockchain solutions. Such uncertainties \nmay discourage many companies to deploy \nBlockchain systems and in the end create \nlimitations on its potential applications. At the \nsame time, companies shouldn't close off \ninnovative decentralised systems for data \nprocessing and managing such as Blockchain and \nother DLTs can offer. It can be argued that current \nregulations were mostly designed for centralised \ncloud services model in which a limited number of \nproviders are responsible for processing and \ncollecting personal data\n199\n. Still the possibilities \naround decentralised systems might change this \nlandscape and even stimulate new regimes for \ndata management in general as the previous sub-\nchapter explored in more detail. \n \n5.6.

They \nshould also consider if the translation of \nphysical assets into digital representations \nis feasible and/or advantageous. This would \nbe the case for example in the manufacturing \nsector when information of a physical product \ncould be digitalised, and then tracked throughout \nthe supply chain as it is designed, built and \ndistributed by different stakeholders. \n \nFurthermore, companies should assess if there is \na need for a permanent and tamper proof \nrecord that is accepted and accessible by \nmultiple parties, which ultimately results in \nconstant data sharing and updates across the \nnetwork. Also to be considered is the type of data \nto be recorded on a Blockchain, that is, if \npersonal, sensitive or non-transactional data \nis an important part of the company\u2019s \nactivities, which might bring in the end extra \ndifficulties or costs to protect that data when \ndeploying a Blockchain. Another factor for the \nassessment would be if authentication of \ntransactions and management of \ncontractual obligations across distant and \noften untrusted parties could be improved \nvia a Blockchain solution. \n \nAs an early-stage technology with a limited set of \nsuccessful pilots and available results, \nBlockchain and other DLTs often entail \npotential risks and barriers to be taken into \naccount by industry, businesses and SMEs \ninterested in its deployment. Present \nuncertainties over the legal status or formal \nacceptance of several Blockchain solutions, \nsuch as the creation of tokens or coins, \ntransactions performed via smart contracts, \nor management of personal data, make any \nassessment of regulatory ramifications very \nchallenging. \n \nDespite prospects over replacing third parties \nverification by Blockchain mechanisms, in reality \nmost companies will need to comply with a \nnumber of existing rules and standards, that is, to \noperate in a particular regulatory framework. This \ncompliance usually has high costs linked to \nservices provided by third parties such as banks, \nclearing houses, payments networks, \ngovernments, certification bodies, etc. In this \nsense, they provide a stable environment for \nbusinesses and companies when authenticating \nidentities and transactions, providing guarantees \nand possible compensations, or providing \nmechanisms for arbitration and conflict resolution. \nEach organisation needs to assess to the best of \ntheir capacity, preferably under legal specialised \ncounsel, the potential trade-offs between \nregulatory uncertainty and high compliance costs \nin their current ecosystem. \n \nA common concern or barrier for industry, \nbusinesses and SMEs aiming to deploy any \ndigital technology relates to upskilling their \nworkforce and overall potential impact on \ncurrent jobs. Successful deployment and \ncustomisation of Blockchain solutions in most \norganisations might require not only recruitment \nof proficient Blockchain developers and architects \n(now in high demand), but also suitable \ninvestments in digital skills training for many of \ntheir staff. Moreover, these technologies could be \nexpected to change the job landscape across \nsectors203 by revamping for instance tasks of \nregistry and authentication (e.g. notaries), \nprocessing and auditing of transactions (e. g. \ncustoms personnel, bank clerks, accountants), \ntrading, risk assessment and design of prediction \nmodels (e.g. financial analysts), monitoring and \nexecution of contracts (e.g. lawyers), to name a \nfew. \n \nIt is far too soon to estimate potential job losses \nor displacements resulting from the deployment \nof Blockchain\u2019s encrypted and automated \nmechanisms. Such potential changes echo in \nmany cases, however, ongoing research looking \ninto the future of work and the impact of \nautomation, artificial intelligence and \nmachine learning. Despite its high prominence in \nthe political and economic agenda, there is no \nconsensus over the future impact of digital \ntechnologies on jobs. \n \n                                                          \n203 See <https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/school/news/school-launches-\nblockchain-strategy-programme>   \n91 \n \n \nEstimates greatly vary depending on \ncategorisations, methodology, and/or geographical \nreach. A McKinsey report projects losses of 400 \nmillion to 800 million jobs worldwide by 2030204 \nand up to one third in the United States and \nGermany and nearly half in Japan. Other research \nestimates up to 47% of US jobs at high risk of \nautomation in the next few decades205. And a \nrecent OECD report indicates that 14% of jobs in \n32 countries are highly automatable with a \nprobability of automation of over 70%, and \noverall close  to  one  in  two  jobs  are  likely  to  \nbe  significantly  affected  by  automation,  \ndepending on  the  performed tasks.206. In this \ncontext, organisations might face significant \nchallenges in providing workers\u2019 retraining and \nsocial protection as a result of restructured jobs or \ndownsizings. \n \nAn in-depth analysis of opportunities and \nrisks based on each company's business and \nregulatory context should be followed by an \nassessment of Blockchain technical \nfeasibility. It entails a functional and \ntechnical scoping of possible architectures \naccording to specific opportunities and risks \npreviously identified\n207\n. Design choices for a \nBlockchain solution include its basic requirements \nregarding governance and consensus \nmechanisms based on the type of public \n(and/or permissionless), private (and/or \npermissioned) or hybrid architecture. \nOrganisations would need to define who has \npermission to record or access the ledger, or \nvalidate transactions, that is, to clearly define the \nroles of each participant. Security and encryption \nrequirements, for instance regarding management \nof digital keys (if they are hold by participants \n                                                          \n204 James Manyika and others, Jobs Lost, Jobs Gained: \nWorkforce Transitions in a Time of Automation, McKinsey \nGlobal Institute, 2017 <https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-\ninsights/future-of-organizations-and-work/what-the-future-of-\nwork-will-mean-for-jobs-skills-and-wages>. \n205 Carl Benedikt Frey and others, The Future of Employment: \nHow Susceptible Are Jobs to Computerisation?, 2013 \n<http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Fu\nture_of_Employment.pdf> [accessed 26 July 2016]. \n206 Ljubica Nedelkoska, Glenda Quintini and Glenda Quintini, \nAutomation, Skill Use and Training, OECD Social, Employment \nand Migration Working Papers, (Paris, 2018) \n<http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/2e2f4eea-en>. \n207 KPMG, Blockchain Consensus: Immutable Agreement for the \nInternet of Value, 2016. \nseparately or managed by third parties) should \nalso be carefully delineated. \n \nA clear outline of what, how and when data is \nshared and kept (on-chain for open access, \nor off-chain for restricted or local storage) \nacross the network is essential, also taking \ninto account current regulatory frameworks for \nprivacy and personal data, namely GDPR. \nOrganisations should also consider their \nrequirements in terms of speed and number \nof transactions to be processed, that is, the \nissue of scalability which for public blockchains at \nthe present time is under considerable limits, \nalthough several solutions are under development. \n \nAfter an assessment of available options and \ncomparison of different architectures, \norganisations would ideally come up with their \nown use case or prototype, under an \nexploratory mode with constant feedback \nloops to monitor and evaluate their preliminary \nand final results. Building a customised Blockchain \nsolution from scratch might require considerable \ninvestment in resources and IT capacity, also \nfacing potential incompatibility with legacy IT \nsystems which may need to be readjusted or \ncompletely revamped. \n \nAnother option would be to acquire platform and \nenterprise integrated solutions or 'Blockchain as a \nService' (Baas), now being offered by a number of \ncompanies such as Microsoft, SAP, Oracle, \nHewlett-Packard, Amazon and IBM. Consortia such \nas Hyperledger208 (gathering organisations in \nfinance, banking, IoT, supply chain, manufacturing \nand technology, including IBM) or Ethereum \nEnterprise Alliance209 (joining enterprises, startups, \nacademics, and technology vendors) are also \ndeveloping among its members enterprise grade \nand open source DLTs across industries. \n \nIn sum, an overall assessment of opportunities \nand risks can be a burdensome and challenging \nexercise at the same time for most industries, \nbusinesses and SMEs.

Science for Policy Strategic Recommendations \n \n  \nSupporting Experimentation and Piloting \nwith Simplified Requirements. A fast-\npaced, uncertain but at the same time promising \nspace such as Blockchain requires more open \nexplorations, for instance through the multiplication \nof high-risk prototypes, Proofs-of-Concepts (PoCs) \nand pilots in diverse areas and/or sectors. This would \nneed, however, simplified mechanisms with higher \nlevel of funding and shorter time from calls for \nproposals to grant agreements, such as in SME \nInstrument. The purpose is to attract the best players \ncurrently put off by burdensome procedures, and to \nlower the barrier of entry for SMEs and entrepreneurs \nwith limited administrative and financial capacity. Yet, \nreal-time monitoring and evaluation with adequate \nfollow-up should be in place to learn from setbacks, \nextract lessons and improve next rounds.  \n \n \nBuilding Upon Other Digitisation \nInitiatives and Programmes. The \nBlockchain space should be incentivized to connect \nwith ongoing strategies for digitising industry, \nconsidering larger companies or SMEs. This is crucial \nto avoid duplications or overlaps in a crowded context \nalready faced with problems of visibility and access \nespecially for smaller players. Such choice could also \nhelp with policy integration and potential convergence \nof Blockchain with key industrial technologies, such as \nInternet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, robotics, \n3D printing, or advanced materials and \nmanufacturing. If done right, Blockchain companies \ncould leverage on existing and new incubators / \naccelerators, innovation spaces and labs, digital \ninnovation hubs, or competence centres. In this \nsetting, not only larger industry and business players \nbut also SMEs would be able to run experiments with \nthis particular technology, helping to advance new \neconomic and organisational models in integrated \nways and from the ground-up. \n \n \nStimulating Knowledge Sharing and \nCollaborations Between Projects. \nFacilitating constructive and inclusive dialogues \nbetween Blockchain projects should help the space to \nachieve maturity and clear it of deceptive and / or \nvolatile ventures. Priority should be given to free and \nopen source models for developing research,  \n \nplatforms and protocols within a mix of public, private \nor hybrid consortia, alliances and programs. Technical  \ndevelopments should be embedded in robust and \ntransparent governance frameworks, agreed across \ncommunities and involved stakeholders, including \nclear identification of responsibilities and decision-\nmaking procedures. Incentivizing sharing of results \nand exchange of best practices in decentralised ways \nfor all players will be essential to scale up projects \nand maximize their impact across common sectorial \nand market boundaries.  \n \n \nFostering Interoperability and Open \nStandards With Wider Engagement. \nDefinition of interoperable protocols should be \npromoted at supranational level, so that Blockchain \narchitectures don\u2019t end up siloed and unable to \ncommunicate with each other, as they grow in \nnumber and diversity. Lessons can be drawn from \nfree and open source worlds where fragmentation \noften hampers adoption and investment return. Open \nstandards should continue to be fostered by existing \nbodies and organisations as a main approach \nfollowing multistakeholder, collaborative and \nconsensus driven processes. Yet, a balance between, \non one hand, the benefits of standards for cross-\nindustry adoption and, on the other hand, concerns \nover premature adoption possibly validating untested \ntechnologies and / or solutions from influential \nmembers, should be further addressed. Dangers of \nplatform or vendor lock-ins as barriers for innovation \nshould be minimised by inclusive processes that \nwould allow in practice smaller or newer players to \nfully participate in the development of open \nstandards or other interoperability mechanisms. \n \n \nPromoting Adequate Skills and Training \nAlso Beyond Core Blockchain Spaces. \nIncentives to recruitment and / or development of \nprograms to mobilise the best talent in the Blockchain \nspace could be designed or built on top of existing \nEuropean, national and local initiatives. Yet, taking \ninto account the novelty of the space and skills \nshortage, these efforts should also create Blockchain \nexpertise across a diversity of areas, from software \nengineering and development, cryptography and \nbusiness strategy, to behavioural economy, law, \n94 \n \n \ndesign, and political and social science. There is no \nconsensus over the future impact of digital \ntechnologies on jobs, let alone Blockchain\u2019s specific \nimpact. It could be expected, however, to revamp a \nnumber of tasks and jobs across sectors. Adequate \nactions for upskilling or digital skills training, with \nattention to SMEs, should be further pursued, also \nbuilding on present strategies for digital education. \n \n \nCultivating Wider Exchanges Between \nPolicy and Blockchain Stakeholders. \nCapacity building and knowledge sharing between \npolicy makers, regulators and supervisors, on one \nside, and Blockchain companies, startups and \nentrepreneurs, on the other side, should be fostered \nthroughout the whole policy cycle. Aiming to surpass \nthe crowded profusion of white papers, and to go \nbeyond inflated expectations or vested interests, \npolicymakers should engage directly with Blockchain \ncompanies with ongoing applications in order to \nunderstand the opportunities and challenges ahead. \nEnvironments such as innovation hubs and regulatory \nsandboxes should be welcomed if they are able to \nprovide robust regulatory and supervisory guidance to \ncompanies, while also improving policymakers\u2019 \nknowledge and potential responses to innovative \ntechnologies, products and models. But requirements \nin current sandboxes such as consumer protection \nmeasures, or IT and cyber risk management, should \nalso include comprehensive economic and social \nimpact assessments. In this context, access to data by \npublic bodies and/or independent researchers is \nessential to review progress, acknowledge pitfalls, \nand allow for anticipatory analysis. \n \n \nFunding Blockchain Interdisciplinary and \nProblem-Driven Research. In order to \nstrengthen the advance of Blockchain ecosystems in \nEurope, funding should be geared not merely to \ntechnological research, but also towards different \nareas of knowledge that could contribute to better \ntackle its current limitations while also revealing its \npotential opportunities. Regarding early stage and \nexperimental technologies there is no question that \nbasic protocols and platforms need to be further \ndeveloped and optimised. But funding should target, \nhowever, specific challenges to be addressed, that is, \nstart with external problems that need to be \naddressed and not with internal issues of the \ntechnology itself. In this sense, policy, economic, \nsocial, legal and environmental analysis of \nBlockchain\u2019s conditions and impacts would go hand-\nin-hand with any technology push. \n \n \nDesigning Stable Regulatory Frameworks \nfor Better Policy Preparedness. Regulatory \ncertainty around key issues in the Blockchain space \nshould unlock opportunities for industries, businesses \nand SMEs to pursue experimentation within reliable \nenvironments. Concerns about over-regulation and its \npotential negative effects on innovation shouldn\u2019t \ntranslate into plain \u2018wait-and-see\u2019 approaches that \nmiss the opportunity to shape and guide the \ndevelopment of this technology. Legal status of \nBlockchain features or applications such as tokens or \nsmart contracts, together with compatibility in relation to \nEU regulatory frameworks such as privacy and data \nprotection, should be the subject of in-depth yet swift \nscrutiny. This scrutiny shouldn\u2019t dismiss, however, \npossible need for reframing or reviewing present \nregulation, which despite its technology and business-\nneutral intention may end up in practice restricting \nthe development of Blockchain as an emerging \ntechnologies with fundamentally new properties. \n \n \nChampioning Blockchain in Public and \nGovernmental Sectors. Supranational, \nnational, regional and local public sector \norganisations should further explore the potential for \nBlockchain-based applications to tackle specific \nchallenges in their own activities. Blockchain could \nprove useful to improve efficiency and transparency \nof public services and how they are created and run \nfor and with citizens and businesses, in cases such as \nidentity management, business registration, property \ntransfers, protection of personal and sensitive data, or \ntaxation. Blockchain could also be used within trends \nor \u2018regulatory technology\u2019, that is, solutions for \nregulatory compliance in monitoring and reporting of \npublic funds, environmental, safety and health \nstandards, risk assessment, among others. What is \nmore, multiplication of pilots and other projects in \npublic and governmental sector could increase \ndemand and steer the development of the Blockchain \nspace towards specific problems, while also helping to \nlegitimize and stimulate experimentation with \nBlockchain and other DLT based applications across \nprivate and commercially driven worlds. \n \n \n \n \n95 \n \n \nReferences \n \nAbed, Robbie, \u2018RightMesh Is Looking to Connect the World via Blockchain\u2019, Huffington Post, 18 December \n2017 <https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rightmesh-is-looking-to-connect-the-world-via-\nblockchain_us_5a38918ee4b0cebf48e9f6dd> \nAirbus, Blockchain: The Trust Protocol, 2017 \n<http://www.airbus.com/newsroom/news/en/2017/03/Blockchain.html> \nAitken, Roger, \u2018IBM & Walmart Launching Blockchain Food Safety Alliance In China With Fortune 500\u2019s \nJD.com\u2019, Forbes, 14 December 2017 <https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogeraitken/2017/12/14/ibm-\nwalmart-launching-blockchain-food-safety-alliance-in-china-with-fortune-500s-jd-\ncom/#162edeb77d9c> \nAli, Muneeb, Ryan Shea, Jude Nelson, and Michael J Freedman, \u2018Blockstack Technical Whitepaper Blockstack: A \nNew Internet for Decentralized Applications\u2019, 2017 <https://icotokn.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/11/blockstack-whitepaper.pdf%0Ahttps://blockstack.org/whitepaper.pdf> \nAllison, Ian, \u2018Ship Operator Maersk Testing Blockchain Tech to Replace Bill of Lading\u2019, Newsweek (21, 2016) \n<http://www.newsweek.com/ship-operator-maersk-testing-blockchain-tech-replace-bill-lading-512506> \nAntonopoulos, Andreas, Mastering Bitcoin: Programming the Open Blockchain 2nd Edition (Sebastopol: O\u2019Reilly \nMedia, 2017) \n\u2018Article 29 Working Party, Opinion 05/2014 on Anonymisation Techniques, 0829/14/EN WP216\u2019, 10 April \n2014 <http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-\nrecommendation/files/2014/wp216_en.pdf> \nAtzori, Marcella, \u2018Blockchain Governance and the Role of Trust Service Providers: The TrustedChain Network\u2019, \nSSRN Electronic Journal, 2017 <http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2972837> \nAustralian Securities and Investments Commission, Retaining ASIC \u2019 S Fintech Licensing Exemption, 2017 \n<http://download.asic.gov.au/media/4570456/cp297-published-12-december-2017.pdf> \nBason, Christian, Design for Policy (New York, NY: Routledge, 2016) \n\u2014\u2014\u2014, Leading Public Sector Innovation: Co-Creating for a Better Society (Bristol: Policy Press, 2010) \nBeck, Roman, and Christoph M\u00fcller-Bloch, \u2018Blockchain as Radical Innovation: A Framework for Engaging with \nDistributed Ledgers as Incumbent Organization\u2019, 2017, 5390\u201399 \n<http://dx.doi.org/10.24251/HICSS.2017.653> \nBehrens, Jan, Axel Kistner, Andreas Nitsche, and Bj\u00f6rn Swierczek, The Principles of LiquidFeedback (Berlin: \nInteraktive Demokratie e.V., 2014) \nBeije, Aljosja, and Janjoost Jullens, A Lead via Blockchain Technology: Position Paper on a Digital Port of \nRotterdam, 2016 <http://www.blocklab.nl/media/uploads/2017/09/A-lead-via-Blockchain-\nTechnology.pdf?x54716> \nBenchoufi, Mehdi, and Philippe Ravaud, \u2018Blockchain Technology for Improving Clinical Research Quality\u2019, Trials, \n18 (2017), 1\u20135 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13063-017-2035-z> \nBenedikt Frey, Carl, Michael A Osborne, Stuart Armstrong, Nick Bostrom, Eris Chinellato, Mark Cummins, and \nothers, The Future of Employment: How Susceptible Are Jobs to Computerisation?, 2013 \n<http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf> [accessed 26 \nJuly 2016] \nBenet, Juan, \u2018IPFS White Paper: Content Addressed, Versioned, P2P File System (Draft 3)\u2019, 2014 \n<http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3561> \nBevand, Marc, \u2018Bitcoin Mining Is Not Wasteful\u2019, 25 January 2016 <http://blog.zorinaq.com/bitcoin-mining-is-\nnot-wasteful/> \nBijker, Wiebe E., Thomas P.

INTRODUCTION17Electrical industry has no relation with the first industrial18revolution (Industry-1.0 or I-1.0). However, the second indus-19trial revolution (I-2.0) was initiated in the 19th century after20the developments in the domain of electricity. The third21industrial revolution (I-3.0) started in the 1970\u2019s via limited22automation using memory-programmable controls and com-23puters. Recently, the fourth industrial revolution (Industry-244.0 or I-4.0) is taking place. I-4.0 is generally characterized25by the application of Information and Communication Tech-26nologies (ICTs), Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical27Systems (CPS) to the industry. Several key components of28I-4.0 are shown in Fig. 1.29Proper integration of the traditional electric power system30with advanced information, communication, protection and31control technologies is one of the important developments32in making the modern power systems smarter. These tech-33nologies help in providing effective solution to the challenges34of automation, monitoring, optimizing, and managing each35component of the power system [1], [2], [3]. The environ-36mental concerns about generating electricity using fossil fuels37and global warming have motivated the Electrical Utility38Industry (EUI) towards renewable energy sources (RES).39The main purpose of incorporating new technologies is to40achieve cost-effective performance of power systems with41good efficiency, high reliability, better flexibility, improved42resiliency, and high security in the presence of demand43response, demand-side management, plug-in hybrid electric44vehicles (PHEVs), RES, and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs)45[4], [5]. In this regard, intelligent electronic devices (IEDs)46such as smart sensors, smart meters, digital relays, circuit47breakers, reclosers, and phasor measuring units (PMUs)48are becoming the basic modules of a modern power sys-49tem, and necessitate a communication infrastructure to50transmit/interchange data, information, and collective actions 51securely in an automated environment [6]. 52FIGURE 1. Several key components of I-4.0.The Grid Communication Infrastructure (GCI) can be 53described as the nervous system of the modern power system 54and plays a vital role in EUI-4.0. The main function of GCI is 55to support: (a) RES\u2019s integration with the main grid, (b) smart 56metering, (c) demand response, (d) PHEVs, (e) demand side 57management, (f) advanced control& automation, and (g) con- 58sumer side energy management. Therefore, in the general 59sense, the architecture of the evolving power system can be 60represented through the integration of the electric power sys- 61tem and theGCI [7]. The architecture of GCI can be described 62in three levels, such as short-range, medium-range, and long- 63range networks [7], [8]. Each of these three levels is a het- 64erogeneous mixture of wired and wireless equipment having 65unique standards appropriate for specific applications and 66meant for particular needs like bandwidth, handling area, data 67transmissions speed, flexibility, mobility, frequency range, 68latency, economic, reliability, and security [9], [10]. The 69fourth industrial revolution is triggered by the development of 70ICTs. Advanced ICTs, the key component of GCI, establish a 71medium of communication for the power system community 72and perform an important job in dealing with different aspects 73of the GCI efficiently. 74The IoT technology is another key component of I-4.0. 75In the EUI-4.0, themajor role of IoT is to handle all connected 76objects/devices concerning monitoring, analyzing, and con- 77trolling the whole power system network, and ensure a 78smooth functionality at generation, transmission, and distri- 79bution levels, and also consumer side [11]. 80Cyber-Security and CPS are two additional major com- 81ponents of EUI-4.0. The present power grid is likely to be 82reorganized as a CPS comprising intelligent policies not only 83to transmit energy but also to transfer information for the 84monitoring and control of progressive EUI [12]. Protecting 85important information/data from physical and cyber security 86attacks is a critical challenge for the grid. Therefore, end- 87to-end secure communication system is important to ensure 88reliable operation of the modern grid. Cyber-attack in power 89VOLUME 10, 2022 100313M. Mishra et al.: Intelligent Computing in Electrical Utility Industry 4.0systems usually affects the technical and economical values90along with energy concerns and reputation [13].91FIGURE 2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria of the considered systematicreview process.EUI-4.0 turns out to be highly complicated and knowledge-92intensive through the addition of new advanced technologies93like IoT, Internet of Service (IoS), and CPS. Thus, the data94referred to EUI becomes heterogeneous (digital or analog)95and large in volume. The necessity of big-data management,96data mining tools, data recognition algorithms, and storage97has increased accordingly. The Cloud Computing (CC) archi-98tecture can be also used for accessing data subject to security99and safety issues [14]. TheMachine Learning (ML) and Deep100Learning (DL) techniques-based data-mining tools integrated101with CC facilities are coming as a new area of future research102scope [15].103The main goal of this review is to expand the perspectives104of electric power systems in the context of I-4.0 application105by reporting various challenges and requirements. Although106several studies on the concept of I-4.0 are available in the107literature, a systematic and extensive review of the electri-108cal power system in the context of I-4.0 is hard to find109in the existing literature. Therefore, the proposed review is110intended to present a comprehensive literature survey on111EUI-4.0 that highlights the current status, future scope, and112major findings. In this regard, a systematic review process113has been followed, where around 5125 articles, mostly related114to I-4.0 and its components, were collected. After applying115suitable including and excluding criteria (Fig. 2) on this116database, 220 closely related articles on the review domain117are selected and reviewed based on different perspectives.118The major contributions of the article are: 119\u2022 It provides an overall concept of I-4.0, key technologies 120and their implementation challenges for academia and 121research community. 122\u2022 The role and transition of electrical utility system in the 123fourth industrial revolution is investigated. 124\u2022 The major objective and application of each key tech- 125nology associated with the architecture of I-4.0 towards 126EUI-4.0 are comprehensively analyzed. 127\u2022 Several open research issues associated with EUI-4.0 128and future research directions, which may be helpful to 129the electrical researcher/utility engineer, are presented 130The remaining paper is organized as follows: A bibliometric 131literature review is given in Section II; Concept of industry- 1324.0 and EUI-4.0 are presented in Section III, and key tech- 133nologies of EUI-4.0 are described in Section IV. Several 134future directions of EUI-4.0 are highlighted in Section V, and 135finally, some concluding statements are given in Section VI. 136II. A BIBLIOMETRIC LITERATURE REVIEW 137A brief study on the available state-of-the-art review articles 138related to I-4.0 and its application domain is provided in 139this section. As SCOPUS is one of the most widely used 140bibliometric databases, this database has been used for an 141in-depth analysis in the present study. 142I-4.0 is gaining increasing attention each passing year, 143Fig. 3 (a). A pictorial proof of the preceding statement is pro- 144vided in Fig. 3 by showing the number of publications (NoPs) 145in the past 10 years. With only one publication reported in the 146year 2012, an exponential growth in NoPs per year has been 147observed since then. The NoPs reported in the year 2020 was 1481498. The above analysis has been carried out by searching 149the word \u2018\u2018Industry 4.0 (I-4.0)\u2019\u2019 in the search engine of the 150Scopus database. As I-4.0 belongs to different sectors of dif- 151ferent industries, the discipline-wise popularity was analyzed 152and is given in Fig. 3 (b). The highest NoPs is reported for 153the discipline of \u2018Engineering\u2019 (NoP= 3128) and \u2018Computer 154Science\u2019 (NoP= 2287) got the next place. The NoPs reported 155in the discipline \u2018Energy\u2019 was 316. After searching the key- 156words integrated to electric industry 4.0 such as \u2018electrical\u2019, 157\u2018power\u2019, \u2018Smart Grid or smartgrid, \u2018Microgrid or micro grid\u2019, 158\u2018renewable energy\u2019, \u2018transmission system\u2019, \u2018distribution sys- 159tem\u2019, \u2018photovoltaic\u2019, \u2018PV\u2019 and \u2018wind\u2019, only a few articles are 160found to be reported in the database. However, several other 161articles are also available in the literature that explains the 162key components and concept of EUI-4.0, but is reported in an 163unintended manner. 164Based on the above analysis with a bibliometric study on 165I-4.0, the electrical power, and energy-based investigators 166may get motivated to think beyond the box, as the research 167scope and the application field of I-4.0 is still in the early 168stage. 169III. CONCEPT OF I-4.0 AND EUI-4.0 170The main concept behind I-4.0 is based on the expansion and 171transformation of the I-3.0 concept. In I-3.0, the computer and 172100314 VOLUME 10, 2022M.

Although, in the era of I-3.0 the174manufacturing industry has achieved a new height of automa-175tion, the development of supercomputing and its related176positive energy and negative threat, forced the industrial envi-177ronment for another revolution. In this revolution, several new178advanced technologies are also integrated with the current179system to make it more automatic, safe, reliable, adaptive,180and flexible. As the final aim of the present work to portray181the concept of EUI-4.0, the origin of I-4.0 and its connection182with utility system are described first.183A. CONCEPT OF INDUSTRY 4.0 ON GENERAL184PERSPECTIVES185The concept of I-4.0 has been reported widely in the past186few years. Several articles related to I-4.0 with a bibliometric187study have been reviewed in [15] and [16]. The concept of188I-4.0 is explained in Consortium II, Fact Sheet [17] by a defi-189nition: \u2018\u2018It is an integration of multifaceted physical machines190and tools through interactive sensors and software with an191intention to predict, control and plan for improved industrial192growth and social outcome.\u2019\u2019 Similarly, I-4.0 is defined as \u2018\u2018an193improved value-chain organization and management across194the lifecycle of the product.\u2019\u2019 In [18], I-4.0 has been reported195as \u2018\u2018a collective term for technologies and concepts of value196chain organization\u2019\u2019 in [19]. It allows interconnection, digi-197talization, data integration, secure connection, interoperabil-198ity, flexible adaptation, and intelligent self-organizing, in the199conventional industry [20], [21].200The following four design principles for I-4.0 have been 201suggested in [19] and [22]: connections, information trans- 202parency, technical assistance, and decentralized decisions. 203The principle based on connection states that the infor- 204mation exchange between machines, sensors, and people 205be through a proper connection/communication platform, 206for example, IoT, Internet of People (IoP), and Internet of 207Everything (IoE). The operating principles of IoT, IoP and 208IoE require machine-to-machine, machine-to-human, and 209human-to-human joint collaboration to achieve a common 210goal without compromising the necessary standards and secu- 211rities. The principle is based on information transparency 212and also highlights the ability of the information system 213in a collaborative environment of the physical and virtual 214world through various interconnected devices/sensors. In this 215regard, a virtual copy of the physical system is created 216through sensors and IoE platform. With the intention to build 217transparency, the result of data analytics must be embedded in 218support systems that are available to all IoE contributors [23]. 219The technical assistant facility toward I-4.0 helps in urgent 220decentralized decision making through aggregating the visual 221information that is collected comprehensively and precisely 222within a short-time span. By the way, it is helpful toward 223increasing the ability of CPS and acts as a supporting sys- 224tem to the field workers handling different unpleasant and 225unsafe tasks. The amalgamation of unified and dispersed 226decision-makers allows the utilization of both native and 227global information to improve policymaking and grow global 228efficiency [24]. The IoE applicants execute their respon- 229sibilities independently. Besides exceptions, interventions, 230or contradictory goals, jobs are deputized to an upper level. 231From the technical viewpoint, decentralized decision-making 232is generally supported by CPSs and smart factories of I-4.0. 233Hence, the technical assistance and decentralized decision are 234two important principles alongwith connections and informa- 235tion transparency for designing I-4.0. 236B. CONCEPT AND PERSPECTIVES OF ELECTRICAL UTILITY 237INDUSTRY 4.0 238It is mentioned above that with new developments, electricity 239began to be used after the second industrial revolution started. 240The application of Information Technology (IT) andArtificial 241Intelligence (AI) in the production sector through automatic 242control of electrical devices and the grid was seen in the era 243of I-3.0. Now, in addition to IT and AI, few more advanced 244techniques such as CPS, IoT, IoE, big-data, Cloud Comput- 245ing, IoS, communication infrastructures, cyber-security, etc. 246are being integratedwith electrical network or grids for differ- 247ent applications such as Substation Automation (SA), trans- 248mission/distribution line monitoring, outage management, 249wide-area situational awareness (WASA), demand response, 250Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), home energy man- 251agement (HEM), PHEV, distributed energy resource (DER), 252power storage system, Blockchains and Asset management 253(AM) [25]. In this regard, several major objectives toward 254energy issues can be addressed such as energy saving, green 255VOLUME 10, 2022 100315M. Mishra et al.: Intelligent Computing in Electrical Utility Industry 4.0manufacturing, managing energy peak loads, reduction of256energy cost, protection from energy break down, improved257energy balance in the factory, etc., [26].258IV. KEY TECHNOLOGIES OF EUI-4.0259A. APPLICATION OF AI AND ML IN I-4.0 (AII-4.0)260The present industrial development seems to be more biased261towards the application and growing research in AI and ML,262as it enables a plethora of new opportunities in the auto-263matic industrialized manufacturing process. The application264of AI and ML uses a vast amount of data/information gener-265ated from the CPS and IoT-based technological paradigms,266for decision making in industrial manufacturing and con-267trolling processes. Generally, data has a certain life-cycle268(for example, data sources, collections, storage, pre/post-269processing, conceptions, visualizations, transmissions, and270applications) [27], but, the noisy data/information are mostly271handled in succeeding steps as filtering noise is an essential272and challenging task. Also, the dynamic operating condition273of industrial machines is a challenging situation to handle for274the AI/ML-based faults recognition, predictions, and preven-275tion techniques. Generally, the ML techniques are classified276as supervised (key term: labeled data, direct feedback, predict277outcome), unsupervised (key term: no labels, no feedback,278find hidden structure), and reinforcement (key term: decision279process, reward system, learn series of actions) types. Differ-280ent types of ML techniques are applied for electrical domain281application [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36],282[37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47],283[48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53].284The details of different ML technique applied in vari-285ous articles are provided in Table 1. In the modern power286system environment, these techniques are used for the fol-287lowing major applications: power system transmission line288fault detection and classification [54], power quality analysis289[55], [56], microgrid protection [57], renewable energy fore-290casting [58], demand-side management [59], and many more.291For a smarter grid application, Deep learning is one of the292most emerging fields of AI which is highly appreciated and293attracted by the researcher [60].294B. ROLE OF IoT IN THE ERA OF I-4.0295The IoT technology is a key component of I-4.0. In the296traditional power-grid infrastructure, IoT has become one of297the key-enabling technologies that pave the way for further298advancements in power systems in view of I-4.0. In the299EUI-4.0, the major role of IoT is to handle all connected300objects/devices concerning monitoring, analyzing, and con-301trolling the whole power system network, and ensure a302smooth functionality at generation, transmission, and dis-303tribution levels, and also consumer side. Therefore, in the304I-4.0 revolution, IoT is regarded as the strongest and impor-305tant candidate among key technologies. The major uses of306IoT technologies in the EUI system can be described as in307Fig. 4 [61]. It is generally depleted in the distribution and308TABLE 1. Several family members of ML techniques.consumption power sector. The importance of IoT in power 309systems can be recognized during the failure in transformers 310or malfunction in any of the electrical apparatus. It can send 311an instant notification to the automation and control center. 312This technology is also helpful in reducing power consump- 313tion and also improves the power quality by continuous and 314uninterrupted monitoring of the power system network. 315FIGURE 4. Major application area of IoT in power system.The major role of IoT can be categorized as follows: 316(i) via internet connectivity, a smart connection can be made 317between each system element. (ii) besides internet facilities, 318100316 VOLUME 10, 2022M. Mishra et al.: Intelligent Computing in Electrical Utility Industry 4.0a cluster of auxiliary equipment is essential to recognize the319sensitivity of the connected devices such as radio-frequency-320identifications (RFIDs), machine-to-machine (M2M) com-321munication tools, sensors, and actuators. (iii) ensemble322of requests and facilities leveraging such technologies to323built-up fresh trade and market opportunity [62].324Use of the three networks, such as Home Area Network325(HAN), Wide Area Network (WAN) and Neighborhood Area326Network (NAN) are not required in modernizing the power327systems technology owing to the IoT-based transformation.328This transformation is generally based on a common Internet329Protocol (IP). This single IP address based digital network330compliments all the sub-sections in any industry according331to the application without any hurdle. In this regard, the IoT-332based communication acts as a cost-effective solution with333respect to the different communication networks.334By this process, IoT is recommended as a significant335element of the future power systems with facilities to meet336all necessary needs. Application areas of IoT in power sys-337tems have been classified in [61] as (i) energy delivery and338pick demand (ii) residential, commercial and industrial, and339(iii) utilities and consumers. The first application area has340the following sub-areas: Smart Metering analysis, advanced341control strategy for transmission/distribution systems, and342real-time monitoring of power generation. Similarly, the sec-343ond one has been divided into Home Energy Management344(HEM), Charging of PHEV, and demand response modeling.345The last area is sub-classified as SM (Smart Meter)/ comput-346erized meter reading (electric water, gas, and heat), AM and347micro-generation. In the study described in [62] it has been348reported that 60 billion IoT-enabled SMs have been already349deployed by many computing agencies [63].350Different major components of an IoT-enabled power sys-351tem are shown in Fig. 5. Here, the examples of sensors352and actuators include SMs, Intelligent-converters for solar353and energy storage applications, sub-station feeders, and354grid monitoring control systems. The gateway is a public355link used by both commercial customers and suppliers in356distinct networks. During the monitoring operation of the357system, data collection is done from the sensor, information358is received from the IPs, and several temporary decisions359are performed followed by the final data exchange process.360TheM2M interface through cloud-server has been considered361as an added key research field in order to supervise the362assembled data/information held. Appropriate data streaming363with verification is completed in an unremitting manner. Big364data is the next important component that handles series of365data. Even the amorphous data is reorganized appropriately.366The application of IoT technology in power systems shows367a number of benefits in terms of efficient grid monitoring.368This helps to reduce the economic loss and unnecessary369consumption of energy. Security and privacy issues of IoT370can be structured by the following five major entities: (i) reli-371ability of data; (ii) authenticity; (iii) privacy of consumers372with proper communicationwith utility; (iv) data secrecy; and373(v) control access of the recognized data.374FIGURE 5. Different modules of IoT built with modern power systems [61].1) MAJOR IoT APPLICATION STUDIES IN POWER SYSTEMS 375Several applications of IoT technology in the power systems 376environment have already been reported [61], [64]. A few 377of them are mentioned in Table 2. The importance of IoT 378in future power systems is emphasized in [65] and \u2018\u2018in what 379way the IoT technology helps to improve the practical data 380transfer capability of different power-grid components?\u2019\u2019 is 381explained. Here, the focus is on the application of IoT in 382the T&D system for online monitoring. The applicability of 383IoT in transmission line monitoring, studied in [65], shows 384that it helps to prevent blackouts, reduces power loss, and 385improves the power transmission line reliability. A novel 386architecture of Last- metered Smart Grid (SG) through proper 387implementation is proposed in [66]. Here, the necessity of IoT 388platform in power system infrastructure is justified through 389a demonstration using IoT servers embedded with Zigbee 390based SMs with flexible user interface. Moreover, an intel- 391ligible integration of power-grid beside domestic application 392built-in with SMs considering a similar infrastructure is also 393discussed. A novel approach for contingency management by 394means of smart-loads, realized by a developed prototype of 395IoT, is proposed in [67]. The framework includes a system 396operator, load serving entities, and the end-user with Smart- 397Home Management Systems (SHMS) that inevitably control 398flexible loads. The issues and challenges in the IoT-enabled 399grid architecture are comprehensively studied in [68]. The 400authors have defined the main security services concerning 401to the smart grid security. However, security issue of one of 402the key elements of smart grid such as AMI has not been 403discussed in detail. 404The IoT-based SHMS with demand response and load 405scheduling is done in [69]. This IoT-based SHMS helps in the 406prospect of economical consumption of per-day electricity of 407the clients through proper coordination with the utility sys- 408tem. Again, in the perspective of utility profit, an appropriate 409demand response modeling method [69] is proposed. The 410security and privacy issue of IoT-based SHMS in terms of 411quality, reliability, and safety measures of the mechanism is 412studied in [70]. Based on a study of the security concerns and 413challenges of the IoT-based grid, several key safety measures 414that should be taken into consideration while dealing with 415system security are defined in [68]. 416The application of IoT in smart building management in 417terms of energy optimization and energy scheduling between 418production and utilization of electric energy is studied in [71]. 419Application of IoT in load demand forecasting problems in 420power system environment is shown in [72]. A method based 421VOLUME 10, 2022 100317M. Mishra et al.: Intelligent Computing in Electrical Utility Industry 4.0TABLE 2. Summary of IoT application domain in EUI-I4.0.on IoT and DL system that extracts features automatically422from past collected data and provides an accurate prediction423of load demands is proposed.424The security issue of IoT-based electric grid in the form of425CPS modeling is addressed in [73]. Here, the aids available426in a forward-thinking manner, highlighting the prevention427of every single customer\u2019s data/info attack, are explained.428A vision towards IoT-based hardware support to handle the429sensing and measuring task of the smart power meter is pre-430sented in [74]. Several articles with the theme of IoT-enabled431power system via SMs are reviewed in [75]. The simulation432strategy of IoT-enabled grid, aimed at large-scale data trans-433mission and distribution, is investigated in [76]. It is also434mentioned here that for an effective and reliable operation435of IoT-based modern grid, a continuous improvement in the436design of SMs with accurate data analytics capability is437required.438A decision-support system framework utilizing ML algo-439rithms that operates inside the IoT environment is presented440in [77]. This decision-support system including electrical441SMs enhances the IoT ecosystem to the next level where442smart-metering, data privacy and security is an important443matter for controlling IoT-based appliances. The uses of444Bluetooth under IoT platform has not been discussed in445this work for potential quality monitoring. Novel privacy-446preserving protocols used for data integration in IoT-enabled447AMI, ensuring high security and reliability are proposed448in [78]. The capability of IoT-based power systems in the449monitoring of generation, distribution, and consumer side is450described in [79]. The output information later helps to handle451the financial trading and forecasting the future electricity 452price. 453An IoT-based energy management scheme through GCI 454is presented in [80]. The GCI comprises heterogeneous and 455hierarchical communication networks such as HAN, NAN, 456and WAN. A solution for all these three GCIs, using proto- 457type development and testing, is also presented. In addition, 458an application of this technology in smart-farming to yield 459better output is also described. A study related to demand 460resource application in theworld, more specifically in Turkey, 461is presented in [81]. It is suggested that considering IoT 462applications, the demand side electric power consumption 463can be controlled more easily. In this regard, the demand 464resource will offer different perspectives on electrical energy 465generation and consumption and the function of electric 466power system. An IoT-based improved architecture for effec- 467tive monitoring and controlling of low and medium-voltage 468transmission lines is proposed in [82]. In this regard, an IPv6 469compatible routing protocol using clustering for IoT-based 470grid is designed. Application of Wifi-based wireless sensor 471networks in IoTs and electric grid is studied in [83]. Here, 472different application areas of grid, like smart power gener- 473ation, smart transmission, substation, and intelligent energy 474use, are discussed. 475C. ROLE OF CPS IN ELECTRIC GRID IN THE ERA OF I-4.0 476CPS is an advanced engineering system that integrates the 477physical system through several advanced computing, com- 478munication, and control technologies. This is, so as to achieve 479stability, reliability, and upgradeability, and interact with 480physical systems of several application domains, for example 481transport, health care, power and energy [84]. Out of these, 482the power system is considered as a conventional application 483domain of CPS tools in the EUI [85]. The physical system 484dynamics of the grid are generally controlled with the assis- 485tance of CPS by connected sensors and controllers via a 486communication link (see Fig. 6). 487FIGURE 6. Architecture of CPS [89].100318 VOLUME 10, 2022M. Mishra et al.: Intelligent Computing in Electrical Utility Industry 4.0Subsequently, the real-time data measurement, its anal-488ysis, decision making, and feedback control of the grid489could be done in order to increase the efficiency of power490consumption, ensure the safety of the grid and reduce the491cost of electricity. Similar benefits are highlighted in [86]492and [87] through integrating the complex physical system493and cyber system. Therefore, analysis on CPS offers a494widespread interdisciplinary structure for analyzing and fab-495ricating these real-time systems. With the CPS, for instance,496a wide area monitoring system (WAMS) and a set of con-497trollers integrated with the grid could build the \u2018conven-498tional\u2019 AC-transmission system to \u2018Flexible\u2019 one. Similarly,499in a microgrid, several RESs can be allied to the utility500grid through power electronic converters controlled by using501local signals (voltage/current/frequency) at point of common502coupling (PCC) side, which entails a communication net-503work in support of the measurement feedback [86]. More-504over, from the protection viewpoint, the protective elements505such as relays also necessitate communication-based network506control. These theories clearly indicate the importance of507communication infrastructure in the CPS framework. Any508malfunction of communication network can cause serious509damage to the system dynamics [87], [88].510The four key elements of CPS are Physical Dynam-511ics, Sensors, Controllers and Communication Network512(Fig. 6) [89].513(a) Physical Dynamics: In the abbreviation \u2018CPS\u2019, the \u2018P\u2019514indicates the physical dynamics. In the power system envi-515ronment, variation of frequency in the grid can be considered516as an example of physical dynamics. It varies with respect to517time. The evolution law is governed by the physical system518itself and the control activities.519(b) Sensors: they are used to sense the physical dynamics.520For example, in modern power systems, a sensor could be a521PMU that senses the electricity dynamics and calculates the522resultant frequencies and phases. The CPSmay have multiple523sensors connected to it.524(c) Controllers: Controllers collect the data from the sen-525sors and perform the control actions through necessary com-526putation. For example, a frequency controller can figure out527the position of the governor valve of the turbine and acti-528vate it, corresponding to the collected frequency data of the529utility grid. At times, the calculation and actuation of the530control actions may be performed independently, and that531may demand advanced communication systems.532(d) Communication Networks: As mentioned above, the533importance of a communication network could be felt in the534absence of a direct link between the sensor and the con-535troller. This communication infrastructure may be wired or536wireless. At present, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisi-537tion (SCADA) is the most used application to supervise the538utility-grid in off-linemode. Several wireless sensor networks539(WSNs) associated with CPS are also used for real-time540and consistent supervisory action undertaken by the grid in541dispersed manner for unlike provisions [90], [91]. By ana-542lyzing the change in required parameters, command signals543are fed to the control center for needed action. Similarly, 544RFID or Data Matrix Codes (DMCs) technologies can also 545be integrated with CPS for identifying several objects in grid 546owing to its smart-sensing capabilities. Once the objects are 547identified, they can connect and interrelate with one another 548in real-time via a particular form of interconnectivity. 549Different grid-CPS testbeds have been established and 550reported in [25]. This report was accomplished by analyzing 551the grid-CPS testbeds based on four major classifications 552such as grid domain, research goals, test platforms, and 553GCI. Several other investigations highlight the sensor data 554exchange standard in CPS domains [6]. These standards are 555comprehensively presented in Table 3. 556TABLE 3. Sensor data exchange standard in CPS domains.The presented or tabulated standards with their collective 557information help to form a highly reliable and smart sensor 558setup for several applications. Therefore, the CPS integrated 559VOLUME 10, 2022 100319M. Mishra et al.: Intelligent Computing in Electrical Utility Industry 4.0with innovative control systems is likely to supervise the grid560in the future in a dispersed, independent, and real-time man-561ner. It allows instantaneous data/information trade among562customers and utility directing high-quality electricity gen-563eration and distribution (EGD) with cost minimization [78].564However, integrating several multifaceted and varied subsys-565tems in the grid in term of CPS is expensive and requires extra566domain-specific approaches to deal with in addition, several567other challenges may also arise during implementations of568the CPS in time and space for several grid applications,569such as collaboration among dissimilar systems, modeling570and system integration, confirmation and analysis of different571CPSs.5721) MAJOR CPS APPLICATIONS STUDIES573Several articles published in the literature shows the impor-574tance of this field toward ongoing and future scope of CPS575in power systems. A few of the recent studies are enumerated576below.577CPS security for electrical utility systems is presented578in [114]. Cyber vulnerabilities and solutions in the context579of power system control applications, such as generation580control and security (for example, automatic voltage regulator581(VAR), governor control and automatic generation control582(AGC)), transmission control and security (for example, state583estimation, VAR compensation, and wide-area monitoring584and control), distribution control and security (for example,585load shedding and AMI and demand Side management), have586been analyzed. IoT-enabled CPS architecture in the context587of power systems is reviewed in [115] and [116]. Similarly,588a detailed survey on modeling, simulation, and analysis for589cyber security application is given in [117].590A framework and security requirements of grid-CPS were591presented in [118]. Cyber physical security for present evolv-592ing grid initiatives was surveyed in [119]. Several past cyber-593attacks and defense system-based research on cyber-physical594power systems (CPPS) are reviewed in [120] and sev-595eral grid restoration techniques to improve CPS Resiliency596are reviewed in [121]. Challenges and opportunities of597Cyber-Physical Security in the modern grid were studied598in [122], and several cyber-physical attacks and defense sys-599tems in the grid were reviewed in [123]. In addition to this, the600opportunities and challenges in a grid-cyber physical security601environment are also highlighted. A widespread analysis of602grid security against CPS attacks on its distinct functional603components is presented in [124] and [125].604A co-simulation framework that validates the perceptive of605cyber-data transmission and dynamic performance of phys-606ical systems, and summarizes the communications among607them in power system applications is presented in [126]. The608efficiency of the stated CPS was confirmed in the following609case-studies: (i) hierarchical control of Electric Vehicle (EV)610charging in microgrids. (ii) IEC-61850 protocol emulation611for protection of active RES. (iii) Resiliency improvement612in contrast to false data injection attacks. A new Hybrid613Attack Model that syndicates probabilistic learning attacker614dynamic defender model, and a Markov chain model to sim- 615ulate the planning and execution phases of a wicked data 616injection attack in an electrical utility grid is introduced 617in [127]. A new multi-QoS information flows control algo- 618rithm based on time-sensitive networking and distributed 619agent technology for CPS applications in the power system 620environment is proposed in [128]. The experimental result 621shows that the stated approach can reckon the fast-forward 622path with multi-agents and ensure transmitting quality. How- 623ever, in few cases the bandwidth occupation ratio has been 624reported to be dangerously high. Therefore in future prospec- 625tive, the data aggregation procedure should be sincerely 626analyzed to efficiently protect bandwidth and upgrade the 627results. 628A microgrid is a CPS with combined power and com- 629munication networks. The secondary control of microgrid 630with periodical communications limits the power system 631efficiency and resiliency. A dispersed event-triggered sub- 632ordinate control structure in an islanded microgrid with its 633CPS implementation is proposed in [129]. The stated control 634structure works with the condensed frequency of communi- 635cation systemwhich depends on the microgrid operating state 636change \u2018\u2018events\u2019\u2019 (for example, load deviations and commu- 637nication breakdowns). 638A more accurate vulnerability assessment method for 639CPPS is proposed in [130]. Vulnerability of CPPS through 640fault propagation under cyber-attacks is studied in [131]. 641In this regard, a fault propagation model generally in 642view of the impact of interruptions on some nodes of the 643cyber-network on the electric physical systems, is proposed. 644A data-centric scheme for CPS heterogeneity in the grid is 645proposed in [84]. A Support Vector Machine and Princi- 646pal Component Analysis based approach to classifying the 647real and false faulty conditions in the transmission line of 648CPS-based electrical grid is proposed in [132] and an Intru- 649sion Detection System to sense lethal attacks with a focus 650on two grid security issues (integrity and availability) is 651proposed in [133]. 652Against integrity issues with price manipulation attacks, 653initially a cumulative sum method to detect these attacks, 654even with small price changes, is proposed. Secondly, against 655availability issues with Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, 656an effective technique has been developed to monitor and 657sense any misbehaving node. 658A good analysis with the aim of facilitating reliability stan- 659dard in the grid is presented in [134]. In this regard, an analyt- 660ical reliability model that captures the effect of impairments 661originating from physical and cyber components, as well as 662the effect of cyber-physical interdependencies among these 663components, has been designed. 664PHEVs are one of the economical choices of current smart 665transportation structures and are used to balance demand and 666supply through provisionally storing the electrical energy 667in their batteries. A novel context-aware coated design for 668demand-side management using vehicular-CPS with cloud 669provision is proposed in [135]. 670100320 VOLUME 10, 2022M. Mishra et al.: Intelligent Computing in Electrical Utility Industry 4.0TABLE 4. Notable features of GCI [2].False data injection (FDI) attacks are vital security hazards671to grid-CPS which result in devastating cost to the whole672power system. A parallel rule-based majority voting system673to detect FDI inserted by negotiated PMU is used in [136].674Additionally, an advanced standing system with an adap-675tive reputation updating to assess the total running status of676PMUs, by which FDI attacks can be detected, has also been677designed.678D. REQUIREMENT AND ROLE OF ICT AND679INFRASTRUCTURE ON EUI-4.0680ICT is one of the key components of I-4.0 infrastructure681including the electric grid. The main objective of ICT is to682provide a reliable, and rapid communication infrastructure683that allows automatic information trade amongst the massive684volume of scattered CPSs inside Grid-I-4.0. This real-time685information trade between utility and consumers will lead to686effective and reliable monitoring, control, and management687of the electrical grid [9]. The grid-communication technolo-688gies infrastructure has been separated into two major groups689i.e., private and public, in [25]. The primary goal of both GCIs690is to provide smart self-awareness and improved reliability.691Again, the GCI can be characterized into 3-hierarchical692levels considering the exposure area, data-rate, and693functionality:694\u00e2 Short-range networks (for example, HAN, building and695industrial area networks)696\u00e2 Medium-range networks (NANs and field area697networks),698\u00e2 Long-range networks (WAN) [2].699A brief comparison between these levels considering700remarkable characteristics of GCI is presented in Table 4 [2].701HANs are essential at the consumers and end-users\u2019 level702to facilitate communications infrastructure for the application703of services related to energy utilization. Similarly, NANs704provide communication services for distribution systems. 705WAN is the communication support unit. A number of scat- 706tered small-scale communication networks are connected to 707each other. 708Again, the technologies used in GCI can be classified into 709wired and wireless categories [2]. Nominal features of several 710recent GCI technologies with respect to this classification are 711reviewed in Table 5. In this GCI, the following are somemajor 712communication requirements [137]: 713\u00e2 Bandwidth/Spectrum: It signifies the range of frequency 714operated for data transmission. 715\u00e2 Coverage area: It signifies the available physical area 716possible for communication. 717\u00e2 Data rate: It signifies the quantity of data transported 718inside a definite time period or speed of data transferred. 719\u00e2 Latency: it signifies the time required to transfer data 720between two sources. 721\u00e2 Reliability: It signifies the standard representing the 722availability of data capability. 723\u00e2 Security: It indicates the ability of the GCI to deal with 724physical and cyber-security attacks to provide satisfac- 725tory data exchange condition. 726Based on the applications of GCI, the system is designed to 727meet some pre-requisite values related to these technological 728features. 7291) APPLICATION FIELD OF GCI 730A grid is comprised of several different units such as gen- 731eration, transmission, distribution, and end-users. There is 732good communication between these elements of the grid 733through networking technologies so as to achieve several 734application goals [72]. The key applications of GCI are 735reported as AMI services, Advanced Metering, Demand Side 736Management (DSM), DERs, microgrid distribution gridman- 737agement and automation (DGMA), demand response (DR), 738Electric Vehicle to Grid (EV2G), SCADA, Overhead trans- 739mission line monitoring (OTM), SA, Electric Transporta- 740tion (ET), Meter Data Management (MDM), Home Energy 741Management (HEM), Distribution Automation (DA), Outage 742Management (OM), program/configuration update (FCU), 743firmware update (FU) andWASA. In this regard, the commu- 744nication requirements of different grid applications are pre- 745sented in Table 6. A detailed application of communication 746infrastructures in these application domains is comprehen- 747sively presented in [139] and [142]. 748E. ROLE OF CLOUD COMPUTING IN EUI-4.0 749Cloud computing can be defined as a service over the network 750for resource allocation and uses. In this regard, the architec- 751ture of CC is divided into the following three types: infras- 752tructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), 753and Data as a Service (DaaS) [141], [142]. In the electrical 754utility grid scenario, CC plays a very important role owing 755to the requirement of a distributed data center as a replace- 756ment of a communication network management system (For 757example, managing millions of SMs in a secure, reliable, and 758VOLUME 10, 2022 100321M. Mishra et al.: Intelligent Computing in Electrical Utility Industry 4.0TABLE 5. Technical features of GCI [2], [25], [140].scalable way). In each passing day, there is a sharp curve of759the development rate of Smart Grid can be observed, which760necessitates bi-directional communication capability support761and information processing in real-time.762This development leads to the generation and collection763of a massive volume of analog/digital data, that necessi-764tates a big-data management system for storage, organiza-765tion, maintenance, cleansing, mining, and high-performance766computing so as to improve the electric grid service infras-767tructure. In this perspective, the concept of CC helps in768providing high-performance data storage, handling resources,769and services at a low cost for numerous grid applications.770Therefore, the cloud is recognized as an important platform771with a highly secure and stable link in-between network and772application layers, for efficient use of the grid resources and773services. Because of CC, grid end users are able to access 774the services and resources through the internet from a remote 775location [143]. 7761) OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FACED BY CLOUD 777COMPUTING IN ELECTRIC GRID 778The application of CC in the electric grid perspective is 779very beneficial; however, there are a few difficulties that 780may be faced by the EUI toward complete implementa- 781tion. In spite of these hitches, grid application necessitates 782real-time computing and improved data storage capability, 783which can be fulfilled by the cloud. In this regard, electric 784network architecture has several opportunities and challenges 785for CC technologies [144]. A few of them are discussed as 786below. To improve the electric grid capabilities, CC adds 787several attractive features like improved efficacy, lower cost, 788better strength, central data storage, advanced security, and 789scalability [145]. 790Clouds provide a suitable and less costly platform through 791the internet to share and exchange information between 792numerous devices connected in the diversified DERs based 793architecture. Therefore, it offers a low-cost computing plat- 794form respecting older models. Some earlier grid applica- 795tions were abandoned owing to the scalability problem for 796grid modules installed on larger scales. Could computing 797technologies have solved this scalability issue by installing 798storage facilities geographically and mounting them verti- 799cally/horizontally [146]. Due to this, the need of physical 800data storage devices has become unnecessary. Additionally, 801the robustness of the system is also improved; for exam- 802ple, if power outages/failures occur in an area, an alterna- 803tive/replicated service will be instantaneously activated. 804TABLE 6. Requirement of the GCI applicationsarea [2], [25], [139], [140], [141].Security and privacy of data in clouds are one of the 805greatest concerns for the electric grid. It is generally achieved 806100322 VOLUME 10, 2022M. Mishra et al.: Intelligent Computing in Electrical Utility Industry 4.0through an automatic management system for cloud ser-807vices that offer simpler and improved protection against808cyber-attacks [147]. In electric grid-CPSs, the communica-809tion link between the physical electrical infrastructure and810cyber-infrastructure is somewhat blurred and, as a result, the811control system of grid application has been critically exposed812to cyber-attacks. In this regard, the power system applica-813tion needs to be operated under some specific standards to814evade these cyber-attacks. On the other hand, there is no815specific standard available for privacy concerns. Generally,816the cloud environment is used by the electrical utility systems817to enhance data safety and privacy for grid applications. For818instance, consumers\u2019 information (e.g., power usage data)819gathered from SMs is encoded with each customer\u2019s own820pass-key before communicating to the operators in real-time821in power system networks [148]. Moreover, the data size and822time constraints vary corresponding to the specific applica-823tion and CC ensures safe and reliable control access of data824and communication with utilities.825For different applications, the cloud platforms are also826different (either shared or restricted). In this regard, the827cloud platform is divided into three basic categories: public-,828private-and hybrid-cloud [149]. The public-clouds ensure829their essential services to their clients through streaming on830the same hardware. Here, a cloud fabric is applied to split831the data of various organizations. Although public-clouds832appear well-organized, they are less-reliable and vulnerable833owing to the possibility of attacks. Thus, public cloud type834is not appropriate for electric grid applications. In contrast,835the private-cloud provides better security for power systems836applications. Visualizations and storing facilities are offered837by means of cloud fabric to supervise the access of data.838Hence, in power system applications for supervising and839communicating client data, private-cloud is used.840FIGURE 7. Electric grid application layers in CC environment [144].However, the need for a risk-free environment in the access841of data, information management, data protection, and trans-842fers are the foremost issues for private clouds. It can over-843come these issues through the provision of safety controls at844the operating system levels. Data-security in the electric grid 845networks should be assured owing to the cloud\u2019s confirmation 846and encryption policies. In this regard, the electric utilities 847utilize private-cloud infrastructure having five basic layers as 848presented in Fig. 7 [144]. As the hybrid-clouds comprise the 849advantage of both public and private clouds, they can also be 850preferred for power system applications. During stable work- 851loads, work with private-clouds considering the reliability, 852but in peak workloads, shift the operation to public-clouds 853in order to improve performance. Thus, on few occasions, 854hybrid-clouds are preferred for electric grid application so as 855to meet the consumer requests, such as higher performance 856or higher security [150], [151]. 857The US Department of Energy [152] and the National 858Institute of Standards and Technology [153], [154] have 859published the results of their studies regarding data access 860and privacy in electric grid applications. Reference [152] is 861focused on the issues such as data safety, customer access, and 862privacy policies. Similarly, the privacy concerns of electric 863grid consumers, in regard to individual data, personal privacy, 864behavioural confidentiality, and personal communications 865confidentiality, are studied in [153]. In addition, the secure- 866ness of the electrical grid technologies that unfavourably 867distress the operation of the grid, are cited in [154]. 868An advanced grid security system that includes a public 869key infrastructure technology and few reliable computing 870features, providing the utmost level of safety for the grid is 871proposed in [155]. 872An Integrated Security System (ISS) for the security of 873the power systems against cyber-attacks is proposed in [156]. 874ISS comprises of three basic working modules: (i) manager 875module; (ii) switch & agent module; (iii) assess unit. These 876units help to improve the security of the grid control systems 877and legacy control apparatus by ensuring the SCADA system. 878A privacy-preserving protocol using steady multi-party 879computation (SMC) for real-time demand management is 880proposed in [157]. The privacy-preserving protocol archi- 881tecture sustains the SM necessities like the safety of the 882consumer data, load management, supporting a viable billing 883system, and eliminating the necessity of third-party requests 884for security. 8852) CC SERVICE-BASED ELECTRIC GRID APPLICATIONS 886Presently, CC is used to strengthen all three of the EUI 887basic subsystems: power generation, power transmission 888and distribution, and power utilization, and has become an 889important element for grid applications. Many power sys- 890tem projects based on CC have been implemented in recent 891years, such as Globus [158], EGI-InSPIRE (Integrated Sus- 892tainable Pan-Europe an Infrastructure for Researchers in 893Europe) [159], Information Power Grid from NASA [160], 894Open Nebula [161] and TClouds [162]. In addition, several 895other studies citing the application of CC in power systems 896are presented below. 897A system architecture model in the CC platform to real- 898ize the grid demand response optimization and generation 899VOLUME 10, 2022 100323M. Mishra et al.: Intelligent Computing in Electrical Utility Industry 4.0scheduling is proposed in [163]. The model was the outcome900of the Los Angeles Smart Grid Demonstration Project and901was further implemented in that city in real-time [164]. The902model is used to perform the demand response tasks by903retrieving the real-time SMs data, identifying anomalies in a904short period of time, updating demand forecast in line with905most recent information, and providing targeted replies as906soon as peak load occurs.907A CC application in SM framework is presented in [164].908In this framework, all the grid services that execute a progres-909sive metering application are located in the SM cloud appli-910cations. All these services are industrialized, maintained, and911modernized by the utilities within this cloud. An SM gets into912these services bymeans of a public interface and regulates the913system\u2019s machines relating to the responses received from the914cloud.915A smart CC-based energy management system (EMS)916is suggested in [165]. This CC-based EMS is built with917three important layers such as consumer, EMS middleware,918and physical resources. The EMS middleware and physical919resources are positioned within the CC platforms. This CC920based EMS provides several benefits, such as easy man-921agement of local renewable energy, providing dynamic load922demandmanagement, continuity of power supply, energy bal-923ance during its processing and storage, increased energy effi-924ciency by clustering resources effectively, increased energy925efficiency by decreasing several operations (e.g., monitor-926ing, processing, and communication) of machine-to-machine927devices, and it also provides user-friendly EMS.928Application suitability of CC in the grid-CPS structure is929explored in [166] and a multi-agent technology to control930each node of the grid in cloud architecture is proposed.931The application of CC in grid conditionmonitoring in order932to increase reliability and security is explored in [167]. In this933regard, application of Hadoop and HBase tools to increase934power system productivity through operating idle servers is935suggested.936A model for optimizing the cost of electricity using937dynamic power-supply, internet data centers (IDC), and cor-938rected marginal cost (CMC) algorithm is proposed in [168].939Application of CC in smart energy management and infor-940mation management in power systems is presented in [169].941In this regard, the system is used to monitor the active and942reactive power of the system and provide reactive power com-943pensation. The emergence of EVs provides several advan-944tages to the power and transportation domain, but it may945affect the system reliability through consuming massive946energy. However, the plug-in of EVs at the utility supply947system must be controlled and scheduled with the intention948of reducing the peak-demand. Considering the problems of949plug-in EVs, a novel communication architecture for grids950in CC environment is presented in [170]. The problem of951EVs charging and discharging process is framed, and a952well-organized scheduling method using CC infrastructure953is designed. A distributed multi-layer cloud-fog computing954infrastructure for optimal energy management in electric955grids with high penetration of plug-in EVs is presented 956in [171]. Three major layouts of EVs charging layout are 957studied and compared in this work such as smart charging, 958controlled charging, and uncontrolled charging. 959An efficient energy management system to fulfil the peak 960electricity demand of clients using cloud and fog comput- 961ing is designed in [172]. Similarly, the cloud & fog-based 962architecture for effective resource management is utilized 963in [173]. Moreover, in order to increase the performance of 964the CC, few major algorithms such as round robin, throttled, 965artificial bee colony, ant colony optimization, and particle 966swarm optimization are used for load balancing between grid 967users\u2019 request and service providers. 968A novel CC based infrastructure to store and manipulate 969the data of the grid has been developed in [174]. In this 970regard, an extensive architecture integrated with AMI, pro- 971viding several crucial services and enabling new application 972in the power systems is proposed. Using this principle, a novel 973application to decrease the multiple estimation of fault loca- 974tion in the distribution system using ML techniques over 975SM\u2019s data is proposed. 976Data obtained by monitoring a small scale microgrid was 977referred to cloud and analyzed in [175] in order to achieve the 978demand side management. The experimental results clearly 979indicate the improvement in load balancing. 980For application in power systems, CC is found to be advan- 981tageous for analyzing and solving the security issues. Con- 982sidering this advantage, a security game assessment model 983is proposed in [176]. The proposed model was used for 984analyzing the cloud-based grid in terms of security, defense 985and malicious attackers. The obtained results showed that 986the proposed framework is able to analyses the risk of the 987SG nodes more accurately and improve the defense strategy. 988The CC service model usually includes a third party pro- 989vision to audit the security of the data. Therefore based on 990this provision, how to analyze the data security risk of the 991CC-enabled smart grid system is an important point toward 992futuristic investigation. 993With the application of CC, the networked data cen- 994ters turn into an integrated part of modern power systems. 995An advanced approach to locate and determine the capacities 996of the interconnected internet data centers and battery energy 997storage systems is proposed in [177]. By conducting several 998case studies authors have demonstrated the usefulness of the 999stated integrated planning strategy. 1000Cloud- and cloud-Fog-based methodologies for analyzing 1001the GCI with real-time monitoring are proposed in [178]. 1002This publication is primarily focused on the development of 1003communication system models to be used for voltage profile 1004monitoring and power loss estimation in power systems. 1005However, a cost-benefit analysis toward the application of 1006energy efficient devices in order to reduce computational 1007complexity needs to be carried out to prove the applicability 1008of edge-computing in smart grid environment. 1009With an intention to decrease the electricity demand in the 1010modern grid environment, a dynamic programming model 1011100324 VOLUME 10, 2022M. Mishra et al.: Intelligent Computing in Electrical Utility Industry 4.0with a CC framework, which produced a tiny energy hub with1012clients and presented the clients\u2019 participation in demand side1013management programs, is proposed in [179].1014F. BIG-DATA ANALYTICS OF POWER-GRID IN THE1015CONTEXT OF I-4.01016Integrations of IoT technology and CPS in the power-1017grid architecture is regarded as an important step of build-1018ing EIU-4.0 in the era of I-4.0. Through this integration,1019different power system devices are able to communicate1020data/information between each other andwith control centers.1021As a result, an exceptional quantity of data is generated,1022creating challenges to the standard approaches of data trans-1023fer, storage, and analysis. In EIU-4.0, an enormous amount1024of data is collected as an output of ubiquitous integration1025of devices such as sensors, actuators, controllers, radio fre-1026quency identification, web-based application, transactional1027application and communicating server used for several grid1028applications, for example electricity pricing data, metering1029data, energy uses data, grid systems health data, demand and1030response, advanced control and monitoring and others [25].1031Big data (BD) stands for huge volume of data that needs1032more advanced approaches to capture, curate, handle, and1033analyze than the conventional apparatus. The question regard-1034ing \u2018the amount of data, referred to as big data, is not well-1035defined [180]. Usually, big data can be characterized through1036the following three major features: (i) Large volume, (ii) High1037velocity in data generation, storage and transmission and1038(iii) High variability in the dataset. In this regard, five major1039characteristics of big data are shown in Fig. 8 [181]. Here,1040\u2018Value\u2019 is regarded as consistency of the data. The nature1041and type of data is under the characteristic\u2019s \u2018variety\u2019. The1042\u2018veracity\u2019 covers the quality of the collected data. The term1043\u2018volume\u2019 is related to the amount of generated data and1044\u2018velocity\u2019 describes the speed at which the data is produced1045and being processed [182].1046FIGURE 8. Five major characteristics of Big Data.1) BIG DATA ANALYTICS1047In power systems, data analytics has got an important place1048to support smart/intelligent decision-making through proper1049identification of patterns and interdependencies from a mas-1050sive amount of data. Moreover, this will help EUI to moni-1051tor, analyze and diagnose their inefficiencies in an effective1052way [183]. Therefore, with the application of big-data analyt-1053ics, the electrical generation and distribution process can be1054controlled and managed in a more efficient and transparent 1055way in EUI-4.0. 1056Big Data analytics is generally comprised of massive data 1057and its related analytic methods, Fig. 9. These methods are 1058based on different computer platforms such as Windows, 1059Linux, Mac etc. and they involve certain level of expertise. 1060FIGURE 9. Components of big data analytics [182].The present EUI statistics of big data implementation are 1061shown in Fig. 10 [184]. It can be clearly seen from the 1062figure that only 20% of utilities have implemented big data 1063analytics. Nevertheless, it is also important to note that out of 1064these 20% utilities, most of them used the big data analytics 1065through tapping only a fraction of its potential [184]. 1066Furthermore, as highly structured bodies, EUIs generally 1067tend to be inclined towards system reliability instead of 1068endeavoring towards new technology. Thus, they are slightly 1069reluctant to implement big data analytics. Moreover, a few 1070other factors, such as lack of management support, skill short- 1071age, data management issues, and lack of proper business 1072models, also act against the implementations of big data 1073analytics. 10742) KEY CHALLENGES TO APPLY BIG DATA ANALYTICS 1075Application of big-data analytics in power system environ- 1076ment may face several key challenges in real world situation, 1077Fig.11 [184]. 1078Presently, the quantity of data being produced by EUIs 1079is growing at an exponential rate. Due to this increased 1080volume of data, there is a huge demand for data storage 1081and computing resources. The potential solution to this issue 1082can be stated as: development of dimensionality reduction 1083techniques, parallel computing, edge computing, and cloud 1084computing. 1085Data uncertainty is one of the key features of real-world 1086power system data. This is mostly due to incomplete infor- 1087mation and operational understanding. Due to this, the quality 1088of data followed by quality of decision making get hampered 1089badly followed by decrease in accuracy, completeness, and 1090consistency of data. Probabilistic and stochastic analysis, data 1091cleaning (e.g., dealing with missing values, smoothing noise, 1092outliers, and inconsistent data) are few possible solutions to 1093this data quality issue. 1094Data security (for example, privacy, integrity and authen- 1095tication) has a vital role in system architecture in order to 1096VOLUME 10, 2022 100325M. Mishra et al.: Intelligent Computing in Electrical Utility Industry 4.0FIGURE 10. Status of big data implementation.FIGURE 11. Key Challenges to apply big data analytics in EUI.secure private information of consumers and utilities. Failure1097in data privacy may lead to malicious attack and compromise1098consumer privacy. Similarly, data integrity challenges lead1099to cyber-attack followed by misleading operational decision1100and financial transactions. Techniques available to deal with1101privacy, integrity and authentication issues are data aggre-1102gation, privacy-preserving data aggregation and data encryp-1103tion, respectively.1104Time synchronization is a major concern in modern power1105systems owing to the increased need of real-time control1106and communication. Time synchronized data helps to draw1107significant information from the current and past events1108through real-time situational awareness, and subsequently1109provide prognostic decisions. However, the unsynchronized1110data misleads the decision through erroneous analysis of data,1111and wrong diagnostic of earlier events. At the present time,1112devices are synchronized based on same radio clock, as syn-1113chrophasors and PMUs provide time synchronized data.1114The problem concerning data indexing and query process-1115ing in power systems data increased computational complex-1116ity and processing time of the system. The existing techniques1117against this problem generally use generic tools, for example1118SQL server and SAP for query purposes, which may not be1119sufficient from the system application viewpoint, mostly if1120real-time applications are sought from the big data. However,1121few other advanced data indexing methods such as R-trees,1122B-trees, and Quad-trees can be used to deal with the problem 1123of data indexing in big data in power systems. 1124Successful deployment of big data analytics necessitates 1125proper business models for all stockholders including util- 1126ities, system operators and the clients. In this regard, the 1127utilities should provide sufficient training about the long-term 1128economic and technical values of big data. 1129Several standards and communication protocols (e.g., IEC 113061850, IEC 61850-90-7, IEC 61970/61968, IEEE 1815, and 1131IEEE 2030.5) are specifically designed for power system 1132interoperability. However, no effort is being made yet on 1133interoperability among big data analytics platforms, architec- 1134tures, and system operational frames. In its place, different 1135utilities are applying big data analytics with different storage, 1136computing, processing platforms. All these diversified uses 1137of big data analytics protocol delay the adoption of big data 1138analytics to power grid with its full potential. In this regard, 1139there is a strong need of focus from both EUI and academia, 1140to develop standards for big data analytics architecture, plat- 1141forms, and interoperability. 11423) APPLICATION OF BIG DATA IN EUI 1143Steps of big data analytics are described in Fig. 12. Data 1144acquisition is the primary step that handles data collection 1145task. Initially, the system data is collected from numerous 1146and varied sources in different formats and features. In the 1147data storage step, all assembled data gets cleaned, analyzed to 1148retrieve authentic facts and integrated in a workable format. 1149Data analytics step includes mining, modeling and applica- 1150tion of new approaches to extract useful information from 1151the system data. The following important algorithms are used 1152in this step; clustering, correlation, classification, categoriza- 1153tion, regression, and feature extraction. In the application 1154step, the operational data is integrated with a system to obtain 1155a decision or gain result. 1156FIGURE 12. Key Stages of big data analytics.The application of big data analytics in power systems will 1157be helpful towards (i) making the power grid more reliable 1158and resilient, (ii) delivering optimal asset management and 1159operation, (iii) improved decision making through proper 1160sharing of information and (iv) improved performance of 1161the system. Following are few major application areas/sub- 1162area of big data analytics in power systems: Generation con- 1163trol center (generation planning, economic load dispatch), 1164transmission operator (wide area control, state estimation, 1165stability enhancement, real-time monitoring), distribution 1166system (real-time operation, equipment health monitoring, 1167asset management, planning, forecasting), end users (demand 1168100326 VOLUME 10, 2022M. Mishra et al.: Intelligent Computing in Electrical Utility Industry 4.0response, load forecasting, real-time energy management,1169customer behavior) and market operation (energy forecast-1170ing, price forecasting, risk analysis, revenue management).1171Out of these application domains, a few recent studies are1172summarized below.1173Real-time energy management can be possible by man-1174aging large volume of data in an efficient and intelligent1175manner [185]. Moreover, several other tools or methods (such1176as improved forecasting tools, advanced demand response1177techniques, well-organized data management structure and1178data analytics) also play an important role in the energy1179management of the grid in an optimizedmanner. Several ways1180of information extraction process from big data to achieve1181efficient energy management in the grid are reported in [186].1182An advanced architecture based on big data to support the1183creation, development, maintenance and exploitation of smart1184energy services through the utilization of cross-domain data1185is proposed in [187]. An internet-enabled decision support1186system is also established as stated by the suggested model,1187utilizing diversified data within a smart city framework to the1188design the energy management action strategies. This \u2018\u2018user1189driven\u2019\u2019 decision support system can assist utility executives1190and municipal authorities for handling their building energy1191services\u2019 in an efficient manner. However, a real-word imple-1192mentation dealing with real-time data is further important1193to justify the authors claim. Similarly, a big data enabled1194mobile edge computing based EV charging scheme is pro-1195posed in [188]. The mobile edge computing servers employ1196big data mining and aggregation in a dispersed way to lessen1197the size of data to be handled by the global EV controller.1198By this process the computational cost of the controller get1199reduced.1200Demand response is a fundamental module of any energy1201management process. A clustering technique based on1202time-series data collected from SMs in order to recognize1203appropriate customers and historical energy consumption pat-1204terns inside the DR program is designed in [189]. Similarly,1205a method based on SM data, implementation of a time-based1206Markov model and clustering algorithms to recognize the1207customer energy consumption dynamic is proposed in [190].1208The stated work has addressed the challenges of massive high1209dimensional electricity consumption data in diversified and1210efficient ways. However, the effect of peripheral factors (such1211as temperature, day-type, and the economy of power con-1212sumption) was not analyzed in this work. A tensor-based big1213data management technique for dimensionality reduction of1214data collected from internet-of-energy environment in a smart1215city is presented in [191]. An SVM based technique to recog-1216nize the customer behavior (normal, overload and underload)1217in order to take part in the DR program is also proposed1218here. The overall result shows that the tenser based method1219outperforms conventional DR management schemes in term1220of accuracy. However, the computational complexity needs to1221be analyzed further in the case of large-scale implementation1222such as smart city network. Similarly, a methodology based1223on big data to extract the energy consumption pattern in smart 1224city is proposed in [192]. 1225Non-electrical big data, collected from social media like 1226Twitter, is applied to detect and locate the power out- 1227age in [193]. In this regard, the authors have proposed a 1228supervised topic model with a heterogeneous data network. 1229The method has been tested with actual tweets and outage 1230events. The supremacy of the stated approach compared to 1231other related work is also reported with numerical results. 1232In future prospective, the method can be coupled with the 1233current distribution management system to empower a social 1234user-driven outage management. Importance of geographical 1235information system-based data, global positioning system- 1236based data, weather and lightning data, seismic data, animal 1237migration data, and electricity market data in outage manage- 1238ment is studied in [194]. Applicability of SCADA and PMU 1239based big data in voltage stability prediction is discussed 1240in [195]. Data related to PMU based big data is applied in 1241many more applications, such as transient stability margin 1242detection [196], data-driven mode oscillation detection [197], 1243fault location [198], improvement of reliability and stability 1244[195], [196], [197], [198], and fault event detection [199]. 1245SM based big data is utilized for anomaly detection 1246in [200]. Moreover, the big data technologies have been 1247found to be beneficial for several other applications: for 1248example: transmission constraint management or monitoring 1249of generator performance to improve market and operational 1250efficiency. From applications viewpoint, advanced visual- 1251ization is an important area of big data analytics. Big data 1252analytics with the visualization technologies is used for real- 1253time power system monitoring. Commercial tools like real- 1254time dynamics monitoring systems (RTDMS) are used for 1255visualization using PMU- big data [201]. 1256Power grid state estimation is becoming a challenging 1257task owing to the availability of huge amount of data. 1258A calibrated model for distribution feeder based on the col- 1259lected big data from SMs and photovoltaic micro-inverters 1260is suggested in [202]. Several other applications of big 1261data analytics in power grid state estimation are presented 1262in [203], [204], [205], and [206]. 1263V. MAJOR FINDINGS AND FUTURE RESEARCH 1264DIRECTION IN EUI-4.0 1265Based on the above survey, some possible future research 1266directions, that could help the prospective researcher in this 1267area, are outlined below. 1268A. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOWARD EUI-4.0 12691. A continuous development or improvement in the exist- 1270ing AI technologies is necessary, as their role is impor- 1271tant in the current industrial manufacturing processes like 1272improved product quality, production efficiency and over- 1273all speed. 12742. Use of collaborative robots (or Cobots) is presently 1275becoming increasingly common in industrial as well as 1276VOLUME 10, 2022 100327M. Mishra et al.: Intelligent Computing in Electrical Utility Industry 4.0in research laboratories and commerce. Cobots function1277by taking instructions from humans so as to work more1278efficiently with them, including commands that were not1279primarily anticipated in the initial programming. Robots1280don\u2019t get fed up, hungry or drained. The abilities of AI are1281better than human capability when considering such things1282as miniaturization and accurate measurements, and they1283provide improved quality assurance. The major objec-1284tive of robots and Cobots in the electrical utility indus-1285try is to achieve complete autonomy, without demanding1286human interference, to execute inspection, maintenance,1287and repair deeds at hazardous areas or sites. Development1288of such robots through integrating AI is one of the inter-1289esting directions that require more attention.12903. The current power system infrastructure enables the appli-1291cation of AMI, micro-PMU and DERs in the conven-1292tional grid that provides unlimited potential to improve1293system observability and controllability. AI technologies1294(for example, data-driven and machine learning) can rec-1295ognize the power consumption behaviour of end-users,1296develop situational consciousness, and support system1297operators through providing accurate decisions, exclu-1298sively in adverse circumstances. This has immense capa-1299bility in improving system reliability and resiliency, that1300need further attention.13014. Data collected from the grid may involve varied dimen-1302sions of data quality. Several methods to increase the data1303quality dimensions have been reported [207]. Assessment1304and measurement of these dimensions is dependent on1305individual analyses and user feedback [208] because of1306their association with prejudiced and situational judge-1307ments for quantification. Therefore, in further research1308improvement in different dimensions of data quality is1309essential for enhancing the monitoring and optimization1310process. This will likely have a direct impact towards1311improving the performance of Industrial AI applications1312leveraging these data [209].1313B. INTERNET OF THING TOWARD EUI-4.013141. The IoT based devices generally work under diverse and1315adverse environments (for examples, extreme high/low1316temperature, high voltage, contacts with electromagnetic1317waves, in water, etc.) and they must fulfil necessary relia-1318bility and compatibility requirements.13192. In several applications, IoT based devices and sensors run1320on batteries (for example, different kinds of measuring1321device that are used to monitor transmission lines). There-1322fore, proper energy harvesting methods should be used or1323invented.13243. In the modern grid communication infrastructure, IoT1325based apparatus should support essential communication1326protocols with the intention of transmitting data from SMs1327to the control station.13284. IoT based devices have insufficient supplies and facili-1329ties for example batteries, processing power, storage, and1330bandwidth. Therefore, some data fusion method should be1331adopted to compress and combine valuable data, which 1332helps to achieve energy saving and bandwidth usages. 13335. Delay and packet loss are vital issues that limit the per- 1334formance of the power system. Further, congestion is 1335the reason of delay and packet loss that lowers the sys- 1336tem performance (since IoT devices and/or gateways IoT 1337devices have got to resend data which instigates additional 1338delay and increases the possibility of congestion), and 1339prescribed prerequisites, for instance, maximum tolerable 1340delay, cannot be assured. Thus, it becomes essential to 1341optimize delay and network design by obtaining an opti- 1342mal number of gateways and IoT devices, and minimize 1343the number of connections to each gateway. 13446. Power systems are starting to be comprised of several gate- 1345ways and IoT devices with diverse specifications. There- 1346fore, interoperability amongst these devices to exchange 1347data is really essential. Internet protocol-based network is 1348one important solution in order to achieve this interop- 1349erability. Moreover, it is also important that IoT devices 1350should aid various communication protocols and designs. 13517. Currently, unavailability of specific and unified standard 1352for IoT devices in power system applications leads to 1353security, reliability, and interoperability issues. Therefore, 1354special attention should be devoted to standardize this 1355effort. 13568. During the monitoring and controlling of IoT appliances, 1357internet connectivity is essential although it is vulnerable 1358against cyber-attack followed by financial and security 1359loses. Therefore, development of secure communications 1360for IoT devices in the smarter grid and determination 1361of some security measures for these devices are some 1362essential requirements in the future prospective. 1363C. CYBER PHYSICAL SYSTEM TOWARD EUI-4.0 13641. Reliability study on the optimization of links between 1365communication infrastructure such as HAN-NANs and 1366NANs-WANs for several applications. 13672. An extended research should be possible to identify appro- 1368priate topologies for these communication networks. 13693. Design of adoptable routing protocols for secure and 1370quality-of-service-ware data collection from numerous 1371system applications. 13724. Dimensionality and complexity are two major challenges 1373to incorporate cyber failures and malfunctions in compos- 1374ite power system reliability evaluation [210]. 13755. To enhance security of power grid, grid personnel should 1376not use default or semi-difficult password to access critical 1377data. In this way, the cyber security issues can be avoided. 1378In this context, face recognition technology can be adopted 1379with complex password to access the desired data. 13806. Efficient energy storage is one of the important parts of 1381power system with RESs. In any case, if such a section 1382of the system is attacked, there should be some necessary 1383guidelines that a defender should take to avoid any system 1384interruption [211]. Futurework should provide an in-depth 1385100328 VOLUME 10, 2022M. Mishra et al.: Intelligent Computing in Electrical Utility Industry 4.0risk assessment of the energy storage systems and their1386impact on grid operation.1387D. COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE TOWARD EUI-4.013881. Reliability study on the optimization of links between1389different components of communication infrastructure,1390such as HAN-NANs and NANs-WANs, for several system1391applications. An extended research should be undertaken1392to identify appropriate topologies for these communica-1393tion networks.13942. Design of adoptable routing protocols for secure and1395quality-of-service (QoS)-ware data collection from1396numerous systems uses.13973. The software defined network (SDN) technology is found1398to be an advanced communication networking solution in1399modern power system environment. SDN with the com-1400plete information of the overall network and the configu-1401ration status of network elements is capable of improving1402network productivity and flexibility, in order to facilitate1403traffic routing in the grid communication networks [12].14044. Major communication provisions include security, inter-1405operability, QoS and experience, and scalability. A num-1406ber of recent works in this area are available in literature1407but they are still at their initial stages.14085. The forthcoming 5G of communication networks includes1409numerous attributes, for example, ultrahigh capacity, ultra1410large bandwidths, ultra-dense sites, and ultra-reliability,1411andwith various existing ICT technologies [167].With the1412advancement of 5G, mobile cellular networks are progres-1413sively emerging toward a strong platform for omnipresent1414massive information acquisition, storage, analysis, and1415communication.1416E. CLOUD COMPUTING TOWARD EUI-4.014171. Security is one of the key issues for EUI. Data inside1418the cloud shouldn\u2019t be compromised. However, when1419hackers try to compromise the internal system, the risk1420of data security increases. In this situation, providing1421security to counter these hackers has become a chal-1422lenge for cloud services. Thus, a proper safety framework1423based on authentication is necessary to increase security1424when cloud computing is employed for power system1425applications.14262. Public cloud can be combined with the private cloud for1427significant and economic development of the system. Nev-1428ertheless, security and privacy are two significant ques-1429tions during the necessary data exchange between private1430and public clouds.14313. In the vein of energy scheduling, data traffic scheduling is1432also vital in order to maintain acceptable data traffic rate1433in the grid with CC environment.14344. Application of multi-mobile agent (MMA) integrated with1435CC for cost-effective system operation. Owing to varied1436communication structural design [2] of the grid, MMA1437can be deployed to communicate through unique layers.1438Thus, proposing a suitable mobile scheme for the agent1439is necessary for profitable information management in the 1440grid. 14415. There is a need to improve the delay suffered by the 1442SMs using CC architecture. Therefore, it is necessary to 1443develop a cloud network, wherein smart elements can 1444recuperate their delay by replacing their selected path. 14456. The basic concept of a smarter grid is decentralized power 1446distribution through an accessible centralized structure. 1447The advanced CC protocol based structural design will 1448definitely support distributed character of the grid. Thus, 1449active participation of CC based services by the customers 1450should be boosted in order to achieve reliability and prof- 1451itability in services. 14527. Large amount of data or information flow is generally 1453seen inside the modern utility systems. Thus, as soon 1454as a failure occurs in these utility systems, the network 1455connectivity gets affected followed by letting-down of 1456data centre operations. In this type of disaster situations 1457CC may be used to recover network failures and restore 1458data. 14598. In the present architecture, integrating the energy com- 1460ponents with cloud computing is not possible. So, in the 1461advanced architecture, new protocols should be defined to 1462make a proper interconnection between the cloud platform 1463and the electric grid components. Under such a scenario, 1464the efficiency of both CC service providers as well as users 1465will be enhanced. In the advanced architecture, the opti- 1466mum utilization of network can only be possible through a 1467defined model where access to the grid services is allowed 1468only to the subscribers and others are blocked to access the 1469services. 1470F. BIG DATA TOWARD EUI-4.0 1471Big data analytics is more than just the technical challenges 1472of handling big data. The architecture of electrical grid is 1473complex in nature and has a close interdependency with other 1474critical infrastructure, for example transportation, gas, water, 1475heating, IoT and CPS. A few forthcoming research directions 1476to efficiently implement big data in EUI are given below. 14771. Owing to the power system infrastructure, there is a huge 1478growth of energy big data. This brings several thought- 1479ful challenges for the long-established IT infrastructure 1480with regard to data collection, pre-processing and effi- 1481cient uses [212]. Therefore, IT infrastructure needs to be 1482upgraded in several aspects such as, network transmission 1483capacity, data storage capacity, data processing capability, 1484data exchange ability, data visualization capability and 1485data communication capability in order to support big data 1486driven smart energy solution. 14872. The volume of big-data is generally large and comprised of 1488valued information. However, the quality of data in many 1489cases may not reach a desired standard. In this regard, the 1490relevance, reliability, accuracy and consistency of energy 1491big-data needs large improvement [213]. The big-data 1492driven power systemmanagement system needs a compre- 1493hensive data governance policy, along with organization 1494VOLUME 10, 2022 100329M. Mishra et al.: Intelligent Computing in Electrical Utility Industry 4.0and control measures. Good quality, standardization and1495consistent organization are the fundamental requirements1496of many big-data-enabled uses.14973. Integration and sharing of energy big data from different1498sources of the grid is one of the most challenging issue that1499needs to be focused.15004. Old-fashioned data analysis procedures in data-mining,1501ML, statistical analysis, data management and data visual-1502izationmay run into some technical hitches in dealingwith1503the energy big data. Therefore, research toward develop-1504ment of novel, fast and efficient data processing as well1505as analysis tools should be carried out in order to support1506smart energy management in the grid.15075. Power system is vulnerable to cyber-threat and attack,1508and a lot of privacy information is embroiled in energy1509big data. For that reason, security and privacy is one of1510the essential concerns in big data driven power system1511management.1512VI. CONCLUSION1513A detailed survey on I-4.0 including its importance to elec-1514trical utility industry is reported in this paper. Altogether,1515a large volume of existing literature in similar domain is1516reviewed critically. It is noted that I-4.0 is being more effec-1517tive and applicable in the present market owing to its capabil-1518ity, adjustability, re-configurability, flexibility and dispersed1519manufacturing pattern.1520Effort has been made in the survey to highlight the role of1521different I-4.0 technologies in electrical power domain. In this1522regard, initially, a brief literature survey on the concept and1523design of I-4.0 from general perspective followed by electri-1524cal utility prospective, is presented. Subsequently, a detailed1525study has been carried out for each individual component1526of I-4.0 such as Internet of Things, cyber physical system,1527cloud computing, big data and communication infrastruc-1528tures, from the perspective of power systems. Then, several1529benefits and challenges, and open research issues associated1530with EUI-4.0 are analyzed.1531Few of the important finding can be highlighted as:1532\u2022 Presently, EUI is tackling a robust need to upgrade the1533power-grid energy generation, transmission, and dis-1534tribution capability by incorporating newly evolving1535technologies.1536\u2022 It is observed that the implementation of key technolo-1537gies of I-4.0 in power system infrastructure is gaining1538momentum gradually. Due to this, the present power1539system is gradually inclined towards shifting the energy1540market trend, development of intellectual strategies, rise1541of innovative tools and electricity generation, distribu-1542tion, and consumption to a flexible and decentralized1543structure.1544\u2022 In I-4.0 framework, power system with the integration1545of cutting-edge technology, such as ICTs, CPS, IoT, IIP,1546AMI and IoE, will provide numerous facilities to gratify1547the client requests and financial profits.1548\u2022 Nevertheless, the application of these mechanisms to 1549attain safe and consistent electricity generation to uti- 1550lization functionalities and services in an inexpensive 1551manner will not be easy. 1552\u2022 Research toward development of novel, fast and efficient 1553data processing as well as analysis tools should be car- 1554ried out in order to support smart energy management in 1555the grid. 1556REFERENCES 1557[1] X.

The presence of solar resources, wind farms, and geothermal resources at the transmission level, and small renewable energy sources like fuel cells and solar cells at the distribution level, is increasing day by day. This growing presence of renewable resources in distribution systems has created a new network structure called microgrids [1]. Microgrids are small power networks composed of several renewable energy sources and local loads. Microgrids are generally connected to one of the distribution network buses under normal conditions; however, in emergencies, in case of major disturbances, they disconnect from the power network and supply some loads (important loads). The energy sources used in microgrids are connected to the main bus via power electronic converters, and the injected power to the main bus is controlled through these converters [2]. With the increasing use of renewable energy sources in microgrids, the coordination of these sources with electronic power raises major concerns regarding network stability and reliability issues [3]. Considering recent developments in the energy industry and the significant increase in installed capacity worldwide, reliability and availability have become crucial factors for renewable energy sources to be cost-effective and competitive with conventional technologies. The increase in installed capacity and the development of wind farms have raised significant concerns in various areas to achieve the goals of asset and equipment maintenance of wind farms and ensure long life cycles. Maintenance and repairs performed on a system are important and effective factors in its reliability and availability and play a key role in the production capacity achieved by wind farms [4]. The concept of reliability is the probability that components, equipment, products, or systems will perform their predetermined tasks without failure in a specified environment for a period of time under a certain number of cycles or stresses [5]. On the other hand, to develop investment in renewable energy in microgrids, investors\u2019 income to cover investment costs is of high importance. Given the change in electricity consumption peaks, investors may not have the necessary income during some consumption peaks and may be forced to increase electricity prices suddenly, leading to customer dissatisfaction. Therefore, investment in production development needs incentives to cover investment and fixed costs, providing a  2  basis for improving system reliability and load supply. Thus, precise planning is needed to provide the required capacity to supply customers\u2019 loads with appropriate reliability indices through competitive mechanisms, creating favorable conditions for both investors and customers. The capacity market, in addition to power plant capacity, can also consider load management and control programs (demand-side management resources) as complementary solutions for capacity provision. Therefore, by signing long-term contracts with distribution companies and large industries to reduce or cut their loads to ensure capacity provision, the high costs of building power plants can be reduced, and desirable reliability indices can be achieved. In recent years, power system research has shifted towards evaluating reliability and security due to the increasing occurrence of natural disasters such as earthquakes, storms, and floods caused by climate change. Therefore, new indices have been proposed to enhance the flexibility and reliability of power systems, and the issue of flexibility has been widely examined by integrating smart grid technologies to improve network flexibility. Hence, indices such as analyzing the number of lines removed due to faults and system recovery after faults have been introduced to examine the possibility of islanding operation for critical conditions [6,7]. 1-2 Motivation The rapid proliferation of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, has significantly transformed the landscape of modern power systems. These energy sources are becoming increasingly prevalent due to their environmental benefits and their ability to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. However, the shift towards renewable energy is not without its challenges. One of the most significant obstacles in the widespread adoption of renewable energy is the inherent variability and intermittency of resources like wind and solar. Unlike traditional energy sources, which can be dispatched according to demand, renewable energy production is highly dependent on weather conditions and time of day. As a result, maintaining the stability, reliability, and efficiency of power distribution networks has become increasingly complex. This transformation has created a pressing need for new strategies and technologies capable of managing the fluctuating nature of renewable energy resources. Traditional centralized power systems were designed to accommodate large, controllable power plants that generate electricity in a predictable and consistent manner. These systems are often  3  ill-equipped to manage the decentralized and unpredictable nature of renewable energy sources. In a centralized grid, power flows from a few large plants to consumers, but with the rise of distributed renewable generation, electricity is produced at many smaller sites scattered across a wider geographical area. This decentralized structure creates additional strain on the grid, which must now balance energy production and consumption dynamically, often on a second-to-second basis. These challenges highlight the need for innovative energy management solutions that can accommodate the growing share of renewable energy in modern power systems. One promising solution to these challenges is the deployment of microgrids. Microgrids are localized energy systems that can operate independently or in conjunction with the main power grid. Their ability to function autonomously during grid outages or instability makes them a valuable tool for enhancing grid reliability and resilience. Microgrids can integrate various energy resources, including renewable sources like solar and wind, energy storage systems, and traditional generators. By generating power close to the point of consumption, microgrids can reduce transmission losses, enhance system efficiency, and improve the overall integration of renewable energy resources into the grid. Despite their benefits, the effective management and coordination of microgrids remain complex, particularly in active distribution systems. The variability of renewable resources introduces significant challenges in balancing supply and demand within a microgrid. On sunny or windy days, renewable energy production may exceed demand, leading to potential energy curtailment or the need for storage solutions. On cloudy or calm days, renewable output may fall short of demand, necessitating backup generation or power imports from the main grid. The dynamic nature of renewable energy requires advanced control strategies to ensure that microgrids can operate efficiently under varying conditions. Additionally, the growing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) adds another layer of complexity to the management of microgrids. As EVs become more popular, the demand for electricity to charge these vehicles increases, placing additional strain on the power grid. EV charging, particularly if done without coordination, can lead to significant peaks in electricity demand, exacerbating the challenges of integrating renewable energy. On the other hand, EVs also present opportunities for enhanced energy management. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, for example, allows EVs to act as mobile energy storage units, discharging electricity back into the grid during  4  peak demand periods. This capability can provide valuable flexibility to the grid, helping to smooth out fluctuations in renewable energy production. Hydrogen refueling stations also introduce new opportunities for microgrids. Hydrogen is increasingly seen as a key component of the future low-carbon energy system due to its potential for long-term energy storage and its applications in sectors such as transportation and industry. Hydrogen refueling stations, when integrated into microgrid systems, can store excess renewable energy in the form of hydrogen during periods of surplus production. This stored hydrogen can later be converted back into electricity or used directly as a fuel, thus providing a flexible energy reserve that can help balance supply and demand in the microgrid. The integration of hydrogen technology into microgrids aligns with global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and promote sustainable energy practices, particularly in sectors that are harder to electrify, such as heavy transport and industry. The motivation for this research stems from the critical need to develop robust frameworks that can efficiently manage the operation of networked microgrids in the face of these challenges. The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources, the growing demand for EV infrastructure, and the potential of hydrogen as a clean fuel source all create complex, dynamic systems that require advanced optimization strategies. Existing energy management systems are often inadequate to handle the complexities introduced by these new technologies, particularly in distributed, decentralized networks where local energy resources must be carefully coordinated to maintain system stability and reliability. The complexity of managing networked microgrids lies in the need to balance multiple, often competing, objectives. On the one hand, there is the economic imperative to minimize operational costs, maximize the use of renewable energy, and reduce the reliance on expensive, carbon-intensive backup generation. On the other hand, there is the environmental imperative to minimize GHG emissions, which often requires prioritizing renewable energy even when it may not be the most cost-effective option. Achieving a balance between these objectives is no easy task, particularly given the variability and uncertainty inherent in renewable energy production. The development of optimization frameworks that can navigate these trade-offs is therefore essential for the future of microgrid management.  5  Furthermore, microgrids must also be designed to handle emergency scenarios, such as natural disasters or grid failures, where they may need to operate in island mode for extended periods. In these situations, ensuring the reliability and security of the microgrid becomes paramount, as it may be the sole source of electricity for critical infrastructure and services. The framework developed in this research addresses these concerns by considering the security constraints of microgrids in emergency conditions, ensuring that they can maintain reliable operation even when isolated from the main grid. In addition to addressing these technical challenges, this research is also motivated by the broader context of global efforts to transition to cleaner, more sustainable energy systems. Governments and organizations around the world are increasingly recognizing the importance of reducing GHG emissions to combat climate change. The integration of renewable energy, electric vehicles, and hydrogen technologies into microgrid systems offers a pathway to achieving significant emissions reductions while also improving energy security and system resilience. By developing frameworks that optimize the operation of networked microgrids, this research contributes to the ongoing transition to sustainable energy systems that are capable of meeting the demands of a rapidly changing energy landscape. In conclusion, the motivation for this research is rooted in the need to address the challenges posed by the increasing integration of renewable energy sources, electric vehicles, and hydrogen refueling stations into modern power systems. Microgrids offer a promising solution to these challenges, but their effective management requires sophisticated optimization strategies that can balance economic, environmental, and security objectives. By developing robust frameworks for the coordinated scheduling of networked microgrids, this research aims to contribute to the development of sustainable, resilient energy systems that are equipped to handle the complexities of the future energy landscape. 1-3 Literature Review In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on developing modern and flexible distribution systems that can support renewable energy sources. In the literature review [8], the importance of infrastructure development in the production, transmission, distribution, and consumption sectors has been highlighted, and a research and development plan focusing on  6  modernizing the distribution network and supporting renewable energies while maintaining reliability and availability has been presented [8].  In [9], the flexibility of microgrids to achieve a flexible distribution system has been proposed in a conceptual approach. The analysis presented in this paper includes three practical examples of increasing flexibility using microgrids, showing that communities can use the power system in more modern distribution systems without losing operational capabilities in case of faults and quickly returning to normal conditions.  In [10], the role of microgrids in enhancing system reliability during severe events has been discussed. This paper suggests that microgrids can increase system flexibility and robustness against fluctuations. Various approaches to increasing the flexibility of distribution systems have also been proposed.  In [11], hardware solutions and smart grid ideas for improving system flexibility through network reconfiguration, microgrids, and distribution automation have been discussed.  In [12], a decision-making framework for network modernization and system performance improvement during restoration operations has been presented.  In [13], a method for measuring resilience has been proposed, and various methods have been compared in terms of feasibility. In [14], cost and demand planning in the power system through an optimization model based on a mixed-integer linear program has been prepared, and an optimal development plan considering the installation of each large-scale power plant and DG sources has been presented.  In [15], the improvement of reliability and wind power production based on real-time has been addressed. This research examines a fuzzy artificial method for evaluating real-time conditions of wind turbine gearboxes (WTG).  In [16], relative development and transmission planning considering system reliability and line maintenance have been addressed. This research examines the economic and reliability effects of line maintenance in transmission and production planning, considering the reliability of transmission and production systems.  In [17], a new stochastic super fuzzy framework for managing renewable microgrid energy based on the maximum deployment of electric vehicles has been presented. This paper attempts to formulate, model, and operate renewable microgrids considering various renewable sources, including solar units, wind units, and storage in the presence of electric vehicles.  In [18], the effects of integrating electric vehicles on protection coordination in microgrids have been  7  evaluated. The main contribution of this paper is the precise assessment of the impact of EVs on short-circuit levels and protection coordination schemes in microgrids. For this purpose, a method for measuring the impact of EVs on protection coordination schemes in microgrids using various evaluation indices has been proposed.  In [19], the optimal coordination of protective devices in distribution networks with distributed energy resources and microgrids has been evaluated. This paper proposes a mathematical model for the optimal coordination of protective devices in distribution networks with distributed energy resources operating in both grid-connected and islanded modes. However, these studies mainly discuss the topological structure of distribution systems and do not consider the electrical characteristics or the potential and nature of incidents appearing in the system.  Ref. [20] uses graph theory to evaluate the flexibility of the distribution system in a multi-criteria decision-making problem.  In [21], microgrids with free production capacity were used to supply sensitive demand in feeders after a severe event.  In [22], the optimization of support services in smart distribution networks has been examined to determine how the frequency reduction settings of distributed generation resources should be adjusted to restore maximum load.  In [23], optimal scheduling for energy management in microgrids has been studied, while [24] proposes an approach for flexible scheduling of stationary microgrids. Reference [25] discusses the use of microgrids in the dynamic state of distribution systems.  In [26], a new structure of microgrids was introduced to simplify their proper scheduling. Finally, a new framework for daily scheduling of a smart distribution system based on robust optimization was examined in [27] to secure system operations under uncertainty. In [28], a conceptual approach for making changes to achieve a flexible distribution system through microgrids was presented. This review refers to three practical examples of resilience enhancement concepts and their practical results. The obtained results show that communities can use the power system in modern distribution systems without losing operational capabilities during faults and quickly return to normal conditions.  In [29], the resilience evaluation of the distribution system was modeled as a multi-criteria decision-making problem and calculated using graph theory. However, the method presented in this review mainly discusses the structural features of distribution networks and cannot adequately represent the electrical characteristics, existing capabilities, and nature of events in  8  this part of the power network.  In [30], the optimal scheduling problem for energy management in microgrids was examined. The objective function considered in this review is to minimize net operational costs considering the uncertainty of renewable energy sources. However, the possibility of severe events is not considered in this review.  In [31], an effective approach for flexible scheduling of static microgrids was presented. However, this study did not examine the geographical status of the distribution network and its limitations. In [32], the issue of constructing microgrids in dynamic distribution networks from the perspective of energy management and optimal use of renewable energy sources was discussed.  In [33], a new framework for microgrids was proposed to simplify optimal scheduling, and demand response programs were used to reduce consumer costs and adjust peak loads. Additionally, a new framework for daily scheduling of a smart distribution network based on a robust optimization approach to secure system performance against the worst conditions of uncertain variables was presented in [34].  In [35], the strategic integration of battery energy storage systems with distributed ancillary services in active distribution systems was examined. This paper presented a two-level optimization framework for the optimal allocation of wind energy generation units and energy storage systems with central and distributed ancillary services in distribution systems.  In [36], the reduction of power losses through the optimal placement of batteries in a distributed network with high photovoltaic system penetration was examined. This paper reviewed system losses and power quality issues related to high PV deployment in a distribution network, and using a genetic algorithm, the placement of BESS capacity was performed, and a brief step-by-step analysis was provided to show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in reducing incremental system losses with increasing PV penetration.  In [37], an optimal model for improving the reliability of radial distribution systems by determining the optimal location and capacity of energy storage systems using the TLBO algorithm was presented. The formulation of this problem includes the cost of unserved energy (CENS), additional costs such as investment and operational costs of ESS (lifecycle cost), and power losses in the distribution system.  9  The shift towards clean energy alternatives has accelerated in recent years due to increasing concerns about pollution emissions. Many organizations and countries have implemented initiatives to reduce their carbon footprint, leading to increased adoption of green energy sources and optimal planning practices [38]. One example of this approach is the hybrid wind turbine and photovoltaic system, which in [39] shows the potential share of renewable energies in operator profits. Another approach is the reconfiguration of energy networks, which was examined in [40] with the aim of increasing the share of renewable energies.  As a multifunctional complementary system, in [41], a multi-objective framework for electric and natural gas infrastructure, along with a hybrid biogas-solar renewable system, was presented to create thermodynamic connections and interactions with electrical, gas, and thermal consumption.  In [42], the issue of energy supply planning in the presence of distributed wind and solar generation, electric energy storage systems, and demand response programs on an 83-bus distribution network was examined in a three-objective model.  According to the results of [43], photovoltaic arrays installed on customer rooftops can offer benefits such as return on investment and reduced electricity prices. In addition to solar and wind energy, other complementary systems are being examined to meet energy demand while reducing pollution emissions. For example, a hybrid electricity-gas-biomass system was proposed in [44] as a multifunctional approach to energy production.  Meanwhile, optimal scheduling in the day-ahead market to minimize costs was examined in [45], focusing on the potential of renewable energies. In [46], comprehensive coordination of the resilience of radial distribution networks in the presence of distributed generation sources using fault current limiters was examined. This paper proposed a coordination algorithm to adjust the time multiplier settings (TMS) and current settings of protective devices, such as overcurrent relays, reclosers, and fuses, to overcome common issues with SMDG installations, such as disturbance interruptions and fuse blowing.  In [47], an analytical method for evaluating reliability in smart grids, including renewable and non-renewable distributed sources and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, was presented. The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of a new state matrix method (S-matrix) including a new model for examining the operational states of the smart grid using partitioning concepts and graph theory.  In [48], the challenge of integrating renewable energies into power system  10  protection and reducing it for reliable operation was examined. This paper introduces an alternative protection scheme that can operate regardless of the connected or islanded state of the distribution network and updates relay settings and trip currents based on shared connection information.  In [49], optimal distributed oscillation control based on data in islanded AC microgrids without the need for precise model parameters to enhance their reliability was examined. According to this model, the frequency controller quickly restores the frequency and ensures accurate active energy sharing. This paper presented a dual dynamic programming model using a neural network that increases system stability. Additionally, the convergence of the proposed algorithm and system stability, data-based error analysis, is examined.  In [50], the evaluation and review of investment in renewable energy sources and green financing for the deployment of solar energy in residential buildings was examined. This paper, using the wavelet power spectrum approach, shows that IRE, REEO, and GFi fluctuate more compared to GDP and EIPP during the selected time period.  In [51], the environmental and economic analysis of grid-connected photovoltaic power systems with silicon solar panels, in line with Iran\u2019s new energy policy, was examined. This work aims to provide a comprehensive review of the use of renewable sources from an energy perspective and its prominent policies.  In [52], the replacement of hard coal with wind and nuclear energy in Finland and its impact on electricity and district heating markets was examined. This paper models the impacts of this transition in electricity markets and DH systems and develops scenarios with large-scale transitions to wind and nuclear heat pumps and heat pumps in DH systems.  In [53], the economic analysis of integrating a network of variable solar and wind energy with the conventional power system was examined. This paper quantitatively examines the costs of integrating wind and solar energy on both the demand and supply sides using an economic energy model along with Monte Carlo simulation.  In [54], the impact of replacing thermal power plants with renewable energies on the power system was examined. This paper examines the impacts of increasing renewable energy sources up to 20% after sudden changes in production on the frequency control of Egypt\u2019s power system. In [55], the power system production planning scenarios of Croatia, including the integration of renewable and traditional power plants until 2030, were simulated using DIgSILENT software.  11  Simulations show that the load-frequency control system may not perform adequately.  In [56], a hybrid wind-solar-tidal system was developed using the Multi-Objective Adaptive Guided Differential Evolution method. In [57], the optimization of a multi-objective hybrid system with a hybrid energy storage source using MOEA-DM optimization was addressed. Thermal energy and battery sources were used for energy storage in this system. The objectives of this study are cost, reliability, and storage.  In [58], the optimization of the size of an off-grid hybrid system considering the uncertain amount of energy produced from renewable sources and the uncertain amount of load consumption was addressed. This paper used Monte Carlo simulation based on the particle swarm optimization algorithm.  In [59], the optimization of a hybrid wind-solar system with battery support using a multi-objective genetic optimization algorithm was addressed. The objectives considered in this study are cost, reliability, and the probability of losing energy sources.  In [60], the optimization of a grid-connected hybrid wind-solar-battery system using the energy reliability-constrained (ERC) method with the aim of reliability and cost was addressed. The study area is a residential building in a Mediterranean climate.  In [61], the optimization of an off-grid hybrid solar-wind-battery system using the genetic-particle swarm algorithm and the multi-objective particle swarm algorithm was addressed. The objectives considered in this study are minimizing cost and maximizing reliability.  In [62], the optimization of a grid-connected hybrid solar-wind system considering the objectives of minimum cost, pollution, and maximum reliability was addressed. The solution method used in this study is the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm. The study area in this paper is a village in the Ismailia province of Egypt. Overall, these studies highlight the significant potential of renewable energies to reduce pollution emissions and improve sustainability in the energy sector. Shukla et al. [63] proposed an integrated approach for using electric vehicles and energy storage devices to efficiently control load frequency in isolated hybrid microgrids. They introduced a fractional-order proportional-integral-derivative (FOPID) controller for frequency regulation in hybrid microgrids (HMG). Additionally, they suggested a modified virtual rotor (MVR) concept to enhance system inertia. The study utilized particle swarm optimization (PSO) to fine-tune the  12  controller gains. The proposed controller was compared with several fixed control strategies, including PID, PI-PD, and PIDF controllers. The performance of electric vehicles (EVs) integrated with various energy storage systems, such as superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES), capacitive energy storage (CES), and redox flow batteries (RFB), was evaluated under both steady and variable load profiles. The study showed that the FOPID controller significantly improved settling time, peak reduction, and performance indices compared to PID, PI-PD, and PIDF controllers. Mohamad et al. [64] introduced a new load frequency control scheme for a multi-microgrid power system using electric vehicles and supercapacitors. They proposed a centralized fractional-order proportional-integral controller combined with a virtual inertia simulator (C.FOPI + VI). The virtual inertia simulation was achieved using a supercapacitor (SC) along with electric vehicles (EVs) controlled by a virtual inertia controller. The control system was applied to three interconnected microgrids, each containing a thermal power plant, a supercapacitor, and an electric vehicle aggregator. The proposed control technique was compared with five different inertia simulation topologies: virtual inertia (VI), virtual synchronous generator (VSG), distributed fractional-order proportional-integral with virtual inertia (D.FOPI+VI), distributed fractional-order proportional-integral with virtual synchronous generator (D.FOPI+VSG), and without artificial inertia. The transit search optimization algorithm (TS) was used to optimize the controller parameters. The C.FOPI+VI demonstrated superior performance in providing fast frequency recovery, reducing stress on conventional generating units, and minimizing disturbance propagation. It also increased the gain margin (G.M) compared to other methods. Aslam et al. [65] presented a new multi-level dynamic decomposition-based coordinated control scheme for electric vehicles in multi-microgrids. They proposed a four-level dynamic decomposition-based control approach for the coordinated operation of electric vehicles in multi-microgrids. This approach is comprehensive, general, modular, and secure, aiming to maximize the use of renewable energy sources while meeting load demands. Each microgrid consists of several renewable energy sources, energy storage systems, non-renewable energy sources, electric vehicles, and loads, all controlled by micro-source controllers. The proposed control scheme was validated through simulation-based case studies.  13  Pan et al. [66] proposed a coordinated energy control scheme for an integrated DC microgrid including PV, energy storage, and EV charging. They investigated a coordinated energy control strategy for an independent DC microgrid integrated with PV, energy storage, and EV charging. The study proposed maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control strategies using a variable step perturb and observe method to shorten the PV unit\u2019s settling time. An improved droop control based on the state of charge (SOC) of the batteries was designed, along with secondary voltage bus recovery and power equalization controls to enhance DC bus voltage regulation. Simulation results showed that the proposed coordination control strategy effectively improved the stability of the DC microgrid system and reduced the redundancy of the energy storage device capacity. Mohammed et al. [67] proposed an accurate reactive power sharing strategy for islanded AC microgrids based on droop control. They suggested an optimal tuning of the virtual complex impedance for each inverter to address disproportionate feeder impedances. The proposed strategy established an explicit relationship between the mismatched values of the actual resistive-inductive feeders and the assigned values for the virtual complex impedance. It did not require prior knowledge of the actual feeder impedances, as they were estimated online. The proposed control was reliable and fault-tolerant, ensuring accurate reactive sharing even in primary control. Simulation results and experimental validation confirmed the performance of the proposed technique. Alzahrani et al. [68] investigated power loss reduction through optimal battery placement in a distributed network with high photovoltaic penetration. They examined system losses and power quality issues associated with high PV deployment in an IEEE 33-bus distribution network. Using a genetic algorithm, they optimized the placement of battery energy storage systems (BESS). The study demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in reducing system losses with increasing PV penetration. A comparative study quantified the impact and effectiveness of centralized and distributed BESS placement, showing significant system loss reduction, especially for distributed BESS placement. Santi Mari Anthony et al. [69] evaluated dynamic model predictive controllers for frequency regulation of an isolated microgrid with electric vehicles and ESS integration. They presented two innovative control techniques: model predictive control (MPC) and dynamic droop control  14  (D2C) to address frequency regulation in an independent microgrid. The combined MPC and D2C settings were tuned using a complex evolutionary technique. The study modeled and evaluated a single microgrid using MATLAB/Simulink, validating the integration of D2C and MPC. Comparison results showed that MPC outperformed fuzzy proportional-integral (FPI) and proportional-integral (PI) controllers. Singh et al. [70] presented a frequency regulation strategy for a two-area microgrid system supported by electric vehicles using a novel fuzzy-based two-stage controller and a modified dragonfly algorithm. The research aimed to develop a new frequency regulation (FR) approach for biogas (wind) diesel engines, organic Rankine cycle (ORC), and two-area islanded microgrids based on solar energy with EVs in both areas. This paper introduces a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) for FR with scaling factors as proportional-integral (PI) and proportional-derivative with filter (PDF), forming an FLC-SF-PI-PDF controller. The modified dragonfly algorithm was used to determine the optimal values for the controller parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed controller was demonstrated with and without the presence of EVs. The paper also examines various uncertain conditions, nonlinearities, and eigenvalue stability analysis to confirm the superiority of the proposed approach. Salama et al. [71] presented an adaptive coordination control strategy for renewable energy sources, hydrogen production units, and fuel cells for frequency regulation in a hybrid distributed power system. This paper proposes an adaptive coordination control strategy for renewable energy sources (RES), an electrolyzer (AE) for hydrogen production, and a fuel cell-based energy storage system (ESS) to enhance frequency stability in hybrid generation systems (HGS). In the proposed system, excess energy from RES is used to power the electrolyzer through an AE to store hydrogen energy in FCs. The proposed method is based on a proportional-integral (PI) controller optimally designed using the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm to estimate excess energy from RES. The studied HGS includes various generation systems such as diesel generators, wind turbines, photovoltaic (PV) systems, AE with FCs, and ESSs (e.g., batteries and flywheels). The proposed method adjusts Kn with variable frequency deviation values to achieve the best benefits from RES while reducing frequency fluctuations. The proposed method is validated under different loading conditions and compared with other studies that consider Kn as a fixed value. Simulation results show that the proposed method, which adjusts Kn and subsequently stores the extracted power from RES in hydrogen energy storage according to  15  frequency deviation changes, performs better than methods using a fixed Kn. Statistical analysis for frequency deviation in HGS with the proposed method shows the best values and achieves significant improvements in minimum, maximum, difference between maximum and minimum, mean, and standard deviation compared to the existing method. Kaur et al. [72] presented a frequency control scheme in microgrids based on a coordinated fuzzy electric vehicle charging station. This study proposes an intelligent controller based on fuzzy logic systems (FL) to effectively reduce frequency deviations in microgrids. The proposed controller is applied to plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) to tightly control their charging/discharging power at all times. In this study, PEVs are considered dynamic energy storage elements participating in the frequency control process in the microgrid. Each PEV is connected to the microgrid through a dedicated frequency control unit (FCU). The FCU mainly consists of an FL controller, a battery management system (BMS), and frequency detection links. The FL controller acts as the main decision-making agent, determining the reference charging/discharging power for each PEV. Two important aspects were considered when designing the FL controller. The obtained simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the FL-controlled fleet of PEVs in regulating microgrid frequency even during severe contingencies. Li et al. [73] presented a distributed secondary frequency control method based on consensus for AC microgrids using the ADRC technique. This paper proposes a new distributed secondary frequency control approach for islanded microgrids, aiming to eliminate frequency deviation under droop control with better disturbance rejection performance. Unlike many traditional approaches that rely on an accurate control model, the proposed method requires minimal model information due to the model-independent nature of the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) technique. A linear extended state observer is introduced to estimate the unmodeled dynamics (including unknown disturbances, unmodeled dynamics, and nonlinear dynamics), which are then compensated in the control input. After active compensation, the nonlinear frequency control model can be transformed into a quasi-linear model, based on which a distributed proportional control algorithm is developed for frequency recovery and active power sharing among DGs. Simulation results based on a four-inverter microgrid show that the proposed approach achieves satisfactory frequency recovery, active power sharing, and disturbance rejection performance.  16  Wan et al. [74] presented an improved second-order consensus-based distributed secondary frequency controller for virtual synchronous generators in isolated AC microgrids. This paper proposes a second-order consensus-based distributed secondary frequency controller by introducing second-order consensus control of active power and demonstrates the oscillation suppression capability of the second-order consensus algorithm in depth. Since there are no specific control requirements for second-order variables, i.e., the rate of change of active power and MG frequency in the steady state, the proposed controller can be simplified by replacing the integral control of second-order variables with proportional control of first-order variables, i.e., active power and frequency. Therefore, the communication data volume does not increase compared to traditional first-order consensus-based controllers. This paper also presents a small-signal model of the MG with the proposed controller to evaluate the system\u2019s dynamic performance and design parameters. Finally, simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed controller. Eydi et al. [75] presented a novel communication-free control method for voltage and frequency regulation in DC microgrids based on AC signal injection. This paper proposes a new communication-free control method to address voltage and frequency regulation concerns in microgrids. Energy storage units are controlled by local parameters to ensure system stability. In this method, one unit (the transmitter unit) estimates the DC bus voltage deviation and injects an AC signal into the DC bus. The droop curves of the units are shifted based on the AC signal and their SOC. The shifted values are determined so that units with higher SOC inject (absorb) more (less) power, and the DC bus voltage is restored. Stability analysis and system step response show that the proposed method has acceptable stability and satisfactory speed. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method can regulate the DC bus voltage and reduce SOC imbalance among units without any communication links or central controller. Khan et al. [76] presented an advanced distributed voltage regulation scheme for radial feeders in islanded microgrids. This paper proposes an improved distributed control strategy to restore load voltage levels and achieve proportional power sharing in islanded microgrids. The study considers voltage regulation at the load node instead of the inverter terminal. Additionally, a supervisory control layer is implemented to monitor and correct load voltage deviations and system frequency. The goal of this method is to replace the parallel inverter control methods used so far. Stability analysis using systematic small-signal models and experimental results  17  obtained with conventional and proposed control schemes confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. Khemok et al. [77] presented a microgrid control model using robust data-driven controllers for distributed electric vehicles. This paper proposes an approach for voltage and frequency regulation in microgrids using data-driven controllers for distributed EVs. Without requiring any microgrid parameters, uncertainty information is monitored based on operational changes so that key stability indices, namely damping and robustness, can be automatically calculated. Considering these indices, adaptive control techniques are used to design the controllers. The proposed adaptive data-driven controller is compared with a controller designed considering the full dynamics of converter models. Simulation results in a microgrid with renewable energy sources and distributed EVs under various operational points and uncertainties confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Baharifard et al. [78] discussed smart charging scheduling for commercial electric vehicle parking lots and its impact on distribution network imbalance indices. This paper proposes a two-stage framework where the first stage involves several technical parameters such as battery conditions, charge/discharge specifications, and transportation parameters including daily travel distance, arrival and departure times at the CPL, and the number of EVs. Consequently, the sales and profitability of the EV charge/discharge schedule for EV users and CPL owners are calculated in the optimal CPL scheduling. In the second stage, the effect of CPLs is examined by calculating imbalance indices in a standard IEEE unbalanced distribution network. Additionally, the results confirm that the average profit for EV users increased by 23% compared to the total cost paid for charging the vehicle. Finally, it was found that without changing the distribution network structure and connecting the CPL to active commercial loads of the distribution network, the network imbalance could be improved by about 30% during EV charging. Table 1-1 shows the summary of all of these methods in a window.      18  Table 1-1: Comparison of different methods Approach/Method Advantages Disadvantages Microgrids for Distribution Flexibility Increases reliability and operational flexibility during faults; enables quick return to normal conditions May not account for electrical characteristics and incident nature in system planning Hardware Solutions and Smart Grids Enhances system flexibility through automation and network reconfiguration Implementation complexity and high costs Decision-Making Framework for Network Modernization Supports effective restoration operations, improving overall system performance Limited adaptability to various incident scenarios Fuzzy Artificial Methods for Wind Power Production Enables real-time reliability assessment of wind turbines, improving fault response Requires advanced algorithms and real-time data collection Stochastic Super Fuzzy Framework for Renewable Microgrids Accommodates diverse renewable sources, maximizes EV deployment Complex to manage due to stochastic elements and multiple sources Optimization Models for Cost and Demand Planning Optimizes development plan for power systems, minimizes costs Inflexible to sudden severe events Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) Optimization Reduces system losses, improves PV integration, and enhances power quality Expensive initial setup and dependency on precise modeling Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems (Wind, Solar, Reduces pollution emissions, increases renewable integration, May have high setup costs  19  Biogas) and optimizes resource use and complex maintenance Frequency Regulation with Model Predictive Control (MPC) Achieves accurate frequency regulation in isolated microgrids May require high computational resources Droop Control for Reactive Power Sharing in Microgrids Ensures reliable, fault-tolerant power sharing Can be ineffective without precise impedance knowledge Communication-Free Control in DC Microgrids Eliminates need for central controller, maintains voltage stability May struggle with large-scale applications Frequency Regulation in EV Integrated Microgrids Utilizes EVs as dynamic energy storage, improves frequency stability High reliance on EV availability and user compliance Data-Driven Adaptive Control for EVs in Microgrids Adapts to uncertainty, enhances robustness Requires real-time data processing and complex modeling 1-4 Research Objectives The primary objective of this research is to develop a comprehensive multi-stage framework for the coordinated scheduling of networked microgrids in active distribution systems, with a particular focus on the economic and environmental impacts of electric vehicles and flexible loads. This framework aims to address several key challenges and objectives: 1.

By achieving these objectives, this research contributes to the growing body of knowledge in the field of sustainable energy management, offering practical solutions for the efficient operation of networked microgrids. The outcomes of this study are expected to have significant implications for the design and implementation of future power distribution systems, particularly in the context of increasing renewable energy integration and the widespread adoption of electric vehicles. In conclusion, the rapid integration of renewable energy sources, electric vehicles, and flexible loads has fundamentally transformed traditional power systems, highlighting the critical need for innovative energy management frameworks. Microgrids emerge as a promising solution to address these challenges by providing localized, resilient, and environmentally sustainable power. However, as the literature underscores, effective operation of microgrids demands advanced optimization techniques capable of balancing economic, environmental, and reliability objectives under conditions of uncertainty. This thesis, therefore, aims to contribute to this evolving field by developing a multi-stage framework for the coordinated scheduling of  21  networked microgrids, incorporating emerging energy technologies and addressing real-world complexities in active distribution systems. Chapter 1 has laid the groundwork, identifying the research objectives and challenges that the subsequent chapters will address in depth.                    22  Chapter 2: Sustainable Energy Management for Microgrids 2-1 Microgrid The concept of microgrids is a new one introduced with smart grids. A microgrid is an electric energy distribution system with voltage levels corresponding to conventional distribution networks, where distributed energy resources and various loads are located within a defined electrical boundary. The configuration of a microgrid is island-like in distribution systems and near local loads, encompassing a set of loads. Microgrids are active low or medium voltage distribution networks of various sizes and shapes, including renewable energy sources like PV, wind turbines, batteries, loads, and control devices. Microgrids can connect to the main grid or operate independently, and when connected to the grid, they can facilitate bidirectional power exchange. The primary goal of these networks is to address technical issues related to enhancing the reliability and quality of power delivered to consumers. Microgrids offer significant advantages for consumers, including improved reliability and power supply during stress conditions through independent operation and enhanced power quality. Additionally, microgrids shorten the distance between production and consumption, leading to reduced losses and better outage management, and they simplify maintenance processes. Furthermore, the expansion of renewable energy use in microgrids helps prevent excessive greenhouse gas emissions, which is a major concern today. Microgrids have become a central topic in recent research due to their potential to improve energy efficiency, reliability, and sustainability. A review in the journal Sustainability highlights the numerous benefits of microgrids, such as increased reliability, reduced energy costs, enhanced energy security, and environmental advantages. However, the review also identifies several challenges, including high capital costs, technical complexity, regulatory hurdles, and maintenance requirements. The study emphasizes the need for strategic planning and technological advancements to overcome these challenges and fully harness the potential of microgrids. By examining the current state of microgrid development in various regions, the research underscores the unique opportunities microgrids offer for addressing energy poverty, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and promoting sustainable economic growth.  23  Another significant area of research focuses on energy management systems (EMS) within microgrids. According to a paper in the journal Energies, effective EMS are crucial for optimizing the performance of microgrids by ensuring the optimal use of distributed energy resources (DERs) and energy storage systems (ESS). The paper discusses various control strategies and optimization techniques that enhance the efficiency and reliability of microgrids. It highlights the importance of integrating renewable energy sources and advanced storage solutions to create more resilient and intelligent energy systems. The ongoing advancements in EMS and control strategies are pivotal in addressing the growing energy demands and integrating renewable energy sources more effectively [79]. There are numerous successful microgrid implementations worldwide. For instance, the Brooklyn Microgrid project in New York City is a community-based microgrid utilizing solar panels, battery storage, and backup generators to provide reliable and affordable electricity to residents. Similarly, the Alamosa Solar Generating Project in Colorado is a hybrid microgrid that combines a large-scale solar power plant with battery storage and natural gas backup generators to deliver reliable and cost-effective electricity to the local grid. In addition to these examples, ongoing research and development efforts aim to enhance the performance and cost-effectiveness of microgrids. Researchers are investigating new battery chemistries and storage technologies to improve the energy density and longevity of microgrid batteries. They are also developing advanced control and monitoring systems to boost the reliability and efficiency of microgrids, as well as exploring new renewable energy sources such as wave energy and geothermal power. The structure of a microgrid, as shown in Figure 2-1, illustrates these advancements [80].  24   Figure 2-1: A schematic of a microgrid [80] 2-2 Types of Microgrids 2-2-1 DC Microgrid The 20th century witnessed a strong debate on how to generate, transmit, and use electricity, known as the War of Currents, between Westinghouse and Tesla on the AC side and Edison as the main proponent of DC. Naturally, this debate ended with the broader implementation of AC distribution in most power networks for reasons that were more logical at the time. One of the most important factors for this dominance was the invention of the transformer, a simple and excellent tool for increasing voltage levels, thereby covering larger areas with the distribution system. In contrast, changing DC voltage levels was a significant obstacle. Additionally, the invention of multiphase AC machines helped people find an alternative to DC machines, which were the only option at the time. However, DC systems have not disappeared from distribution. For example, an old system using gas and electricity in San Francisco feeds DC motors for elevators in several historic buildings. Advances in power electronics, which have made DC voltage regulation simple, along with the increasing penetration of DC loads and sources, have encouraged researchers to consider DC distribution in at least parts of today\u2019s power systems to enhance overall efficiency [80].  25  Many of today\u2019s consumer loads are powered by DC. Household and office electronics, such as computers, laptops, tablets, mobile phones, printers, televisions, microwave ovens, and lighting, all use DC power. Newer and more efficient lighting technologies, like compact fluorescent lamps and solid-state lamps, include a DC stage, making DC distribution systems more economical for these applications. DC power is also utilized in variable speed drives for pumps, heating, purification, ventilation systems, fans, elevators, traction systems, and mills. In industrial settings, the steel industry increasingly uses DC electric furnaces due to their lower energy consumption and reduced light flicker compared to AC types. The electrochemical industry almost exclusively requires DC power. Using AC distribution systems to supply these loads introduces conversion stages, leading to inefficiencies. Approximately 30% of AC power produced passes through power electronic converters before use, with energy losses typically ranging from 10-25%. Research suggests that power conversion efficiency can be improved by 80% with DC systems and by about 25% by eliminating converters. Given that a significant portion of renewable energy sources generate DC power, a DC bus for network connection is necessary. Additionally, modern DC loads in distribution systems have significantly increased in recent years. DC microgrids offer better protection against short circuits and lower voltage levels, enhancing performance and reducing the size and cost of the distribution network. DC microgrids have emerged due to their advantages in efficiency, cost, and the elimination of AC-DC and DC-AC power conversion stages and associated energy losses. A recent paper highlights a research project on advances in smart DC microgrids, focusing on the latest developments in distributed generation and modern electrical loads. An example of this network is shown in Figure 2-2, where several AC and DC sources are connected to a low voltage DC network after necessary conversions and connection to the Point of Common Coupling (PCC). DC microgrids have garnered significant attention recently due to their potential to boost energy efficiency and reliability. A review in the journal Energies highlights that DC microgrids are particularly beneficial because they eliminate the need for AC-DC and DC-AC conversion stages, which are typically associated with energy losses. These systems are highly compatible with renewable energy sources, such as solar photovoltaics, which naturally generate DC power.  26  The integration of energy storage systems, like batteries, further enhances the stability and reliability of DC microgrids. Additionally, DC microgrids offer better protection against short circuits and lower voltage levels, which can reduce the size and cost of the distribution network. Another study emphasizes the importance of energy management systems (EMS) in optimizing the performance of DC microgrids. Effective EMS can ensure the optimal use of distributed energy resources (DERs) and energy storage systems (ESS), making the grid more secure, reliable, and intelligent. Research indicates that DC microgrids can significantly improve power conversion efficiency and reduce energy losses. These systems are particularly advantageous for residential applications, where they can help manage the increasing demand for electricity while integrating renewable energy sources. The hierarchical control strategies and advanced optimization techniques discussed in recent papers highlight the ongoing advancements in this field [81]. Several states in the USA have invested millions of dollars in promoting and advancing microgrids as part of regional resilience programs against natural disasters. Since microgrids generally include renewable sources and batteries, DC microgrids have a high capacity to enhance the overall system\u2019s efficiency. Numerous papers indicate that DC microgrids can play a more effective role in solving some operational issues on the main grid. Additionally, solar cells and batteries can be used to mitigate the severe effects of nonlinear loads. Consequently, these factors have led to extensive research to raise the question: \u201cDoes DC distribution offer the highest efficiency for electric energy distribution, or is it time to consider developing DC distribution as an alternative?\u201d Research has shown that DC power systems are no longer obsolete. They seem more aligned with today\u2019s needs than they were 100 years ago. The figure below shows a real and laboratory-scale DC microgrid at Aalborg University. Figure 2-3 shows a real laboratory-scale DC microgrid used at Aalborg University [82]. This microgrid is also a real-life network example. The laboratory-scale DC microgrid is a single-phase laboratory system designed by the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), including microgrid operations at scales and laboratory simulations for providing renewable energies like solar and wind, designed and built by the University of Manchester [83].  27  Architectures and Configurations One aspect that remains unstandardized is the type of architecture that should be adopted or is most suitable for a specific application. In reality, several possible architectures can be used to establish a DC microgrid. These different structures include: 1. Single Bus Topology  This is the simplest topology, consisting of a single DC bus. All generators, storage systems, and loads are connected to the same point (bus). Figure 2-2 shows two typical examples of this topology: one connected to the electrical grid and the other operating in islanded mode. Besides its simplicity, this topology is characterized by low maintenance requirements and low costs.  Figure 2-2: A schematic of a typical example of the single bus topology: (a) connected to the grid mode (b) island mode. 2. Radial Topology This topology can be seen as an extension of the single bus. As shown in Figure 2-3, it provides more than one DC bus, each used to connect generators, storage systems, and loads. There are typically two possible configurations: series and parallel. In the series configuration (Figure 2-3a), two or more DC microgrids are interconnected in series, while in the parallel configuration (Figure 2-3b), they are interconnected in parallel. This topology maintains some simplicity,  28  allows for different voltage levels, and increases reliability. However, it may experience some instability during islanding mode.   Figure 2-3: A schematic of typical example of the radial topology: (a) series configuration and (b) parallel configuration.  29  3. Ring or Loop Topology In this topology, all generators, storage systems, and loads are connected to the same DC bus in a loop, allowing supply from two sides (Figure 2-4). This topology is more reliable compared to previous configurations, as it can operate in a single bus configuration in case of a fault in the DC bus. However, it is more complex.  Figure 2-4: A schematic of typical example of the ring topology.     30  4. Mesh Topology  This topology integrates ring (or rings) with radial topologies, forming a mesh configuration (Figure 2-5). It is characterized by a complex structure that offers better reliability and flexibility compared to previous topologies.  Figure 2-5: A schematic of typical example of the mesh topolog. 5. Interconnected Topology Previous topologies typically feature a single connection to the AC main grid. To improve system reliability, it is possible to connect to alternative AC grids (two or more), resulting in an interconnected topology. Figure 2-6 shows an example where the DC microgrid is interconnected to two AC grid supplies.  31   Figure 2-6: A schematic of typical example of the interconnected topology. 2-2-2 AC Microgrid AC microgrids, which were initially considered the common meaning for all microgrids, have a significant advantage. Given that all network infrastructure for production, connection, and distribution worldwide is AC power networks, connecting this type of sub-network to the main grid and using the existing structure for power transmission is a significant advantage. An AC microgrid system connects internal distributed loads and low-pressure distributed energy sources like microturbines, wind turbines, solar cells, and energy storage devices. Among these, the presence of renewable energy sources like solar and wind is essential for reducing global warming and environmental issues [84]. Figure 2-7 shows a sample AC microgrid.  32   Figure 2-7: Sample AC microgrid with loads [84]. As mentioned, since a large portion of current power networks are AC, AC microgrids dominate and form the majority of power networks. Given this, the exclusive appearance of DC microgrids in the power network is expected in the near future. In many microgrids, electricity generation units with AC output power are directly connected to a bus and then connected to the main system for a sustainable building through power converters. Examples of DC units producing AC output power include biogas turbines, wave turbines, and tidal turbines.  These are usually either directly connected to the grid or may require AC/DC/AC converters to connect to LVAC networks. In this context, the LVAC network can be connected to the main grid through a power transformer. Additionally, AC loads are directly connected to the network,  33  while DC loads require DC-AC power converters to connect to LVAC networks. In other words, DG units that produce DC power are connected to LVAC networks using DC/AC converters. One of the biggest challenges and complexities associated with AC microgrids is the complex control strategies for synchronization processes and system stability protection. Perhaps the general concept of a microgrid is an AC microgrid, a network where various sources, whether AC or DC, supply different AC loads. In this type of microgrid, DC sources provide a suitable and minimally distorted amount for AC loads using AC/DC converters and appropriate filters. The concept is that loads and micro-sources, whether AC or DC, and of course, all AC loads, operate as a single controllable system and often provide heat and power for local loads. These microgrids can be considered as a controlled cell of the power system, which, for example, should be able to act as a dispatchable load that can meet the needs of the transmission system in a fraction of a second. From the consumer\u2019s point of view, the microgrid should be able to meet the following needs: \u2022 Increased local reliability \u2022 Reduced feeder losses, local voltage supply \u2022 Increased efficiency through the use of waste heat \u2022 Voltage drop correction or provision of emergency power supply functions [84]. Micro-sources of particular interest for microgrids are units with power less than 100 kW with power electronics interfaces. These sources are located at customer sites, featuring low cost, low voltage, high reliability, and low greenhouse gas emissions. Power electronics and the required flexibility provide the microgrid concept. With proper control design and power electronics, the microgrid can meet consumer needs as well as network needs. The above features can be provided with a system architecture with the following three main components: \u2022 Local micro-source control \u2022 System optimizer \u2022 Distributed protection The distinguishing features of AC and DC microgrids are as follows:  34  \u2022 AC microgrids are more compatible with existing AC systems. However, synchronization methods must be followed before connection. In contrast, connecting a DC microgrid to AC systems is easier. DC microgrids are more compatible with the nature of today\u2019s loads, which are mostly DC (household appliances, lighting systems, and motor drives). \u2022 Most renewable energy sources are DC, such as PV cells, fuel cells, and energy storage units. Protecting DC systems is more challenging due to the absence of zero current crossing, a self-extinguishing feature of fault current in AC systems. AC systems are associated with the skin effect of transmission lines. Given the above issues, hybrid AC/DC systems have emerged to take advantage of both networks. Additionally, losses will be significantly reduced with fewer power electronics conversion stages, and system reliability will be noticeably increased [85]. 2-2-3 Hybrid AC/DC Microgrids Various hybrid system structures have recently been used to connect AC and DC subsystems using a three-phase voltage source converter or back-to-back converters. Given the advantages of both AC and DC microgrids and the challenges ahead, hybrid AC/DC microgrids are recognized as an attractive idea with many unique features, and extensive research is being conducted to utilize and optimize this type of microgrid. In fact, this type of microgrid, as shown in Figure (2-8), is a combination of Westinghouse and Tesla\u2019s AC thoughts and Edison\u2019s DC arguments [86].  35   Figure 2-8: Sample hybrid microgrid [86] The microgrid will be a good method for integrating primary micro-sources without any interruption. Power generation through micro-sources and renewable sources such as solar energy and wind farms will be a prominent move. Therefore, hybrid AC/DC microgrids are the best solution to reduce excessive AC-DC-AC conversions in an exclusive AC network. In this way, the AC network loads are connected to a separate AC network, and DC loads and sources are connected to each other [86]. Additionally, energy storage systems can be connected to either the AC or DC bus. Today, most renewable power conversion systems are connected to low voltage AC distribution systems as distributed generators and microgrids. Due to environmental issues caused by conventional fossil fuel power plants, the use of DC loads such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and electric vehicles is connected to AC power systems. When local renewable power sources are available, the use of high voltage lines over long distances is unnecessary.  36  Microgrids are presented to facilitate the connection of renewable energy sources to conventional AC systems. However, photovoltaic panels or fuel cells must be converted to AC using AC/DC inverters to connect to the AC grid. In the AC network, AC/DC and DC/DC converters are required for various household and office facilities to supply the required DC voltage. AC/DC/AC converters are usually used as drives to control the speed of AC motors in industrial plants. Recently, DC networks have been revived to develop and utilize DC renewable energy sources and the inherent advantage of DC loads in residential and industrial applications. The DC microgrid is presented to integrate various distributed generators. Multiple reverse conversions in DC or AC networks only add operational losses to the system and increase the complexity of office and household appliances. The smart grid concept is currently a dominant discussion in the power industry. The goal of the smart grid can be reliability, high-quality power for environmentally friendly digital communities, and a sustainable way. One of the most important characteristics of a smart grid is its complex structure, which can facilitate the connection of multiple AC and DC generation systems, energy storage options, and multiple AC and DC loads using optimal efficiency and operational productivity. To meet these goals, power electronics technology plays a very important role in connecting various sources and loads to the grid and smartening it. Therefore, hybrid AC/DC microgrids have been introduced to reduce multiple reverse conversion processes in an exclusive AC or DC network and to facilitate the connection of renewable AC and DC sources and loads to the power grid [86].         37  Table 2-1: Comparison of different topologies for micro-grids Topology Properties Advantages Disadvantages Single Bus All generators, storage, and loads connect to a single DC bus. Simple design, low maintenance, low cost. Limited scalability and resilience.  Radial Extension of the single bus with multiple DC buses in series or parallel configurations. Allows different voltage levels, increased reliability over single bus topology. Can experience instability in islanded mode. Ring (Loop) All components connect in a loop, allowing supply from two directions. More reliable due to dual supply paths; can operate as a single bus during faults. More complex design than single bus or radial. Mesh Combination of ring and radial topologies, forming a mesh network. High reliability and flexibility; can handle complex networks. High complexity and cost; challenging to implement and maintain. Interconnected Connects to multiple AC grids to enhance reliability. Greater system reliability with multiple AC connections.

Compatible with existing AC infrastructure; easier integration with main grid. Complexity in control strategies, especially for synchronization  38  and stability.  DC Microgrid Uses DC generation and loads, suitable for modern DC appliances and renewable DC sources. Reduces conversion losses, higher efficiency, suitable for DC loads and renewable sources Protection and fault management are more challenging due to lack of current zero-crossing. Hybrid AC/DC Combines AC and DC subsystems using converters for both AC and DC loads. Reduces conversions, efficiently integrates both AC and DC sources/loads; better suited for renewable energy systems. Complex structure, high initial setup costs, and sophisticated control requirements for stability.  2-3 Microgrid Operating Modes One of the most important requirements of a microgrid is the ability to operate in both grid-connected and islanded modes. This capability makes them suitable for providing emergency power to connected loads during an incident, thereby improving islanded power delivery. In grid-connected operation mode, distributed energy resources (DER) are connected to the main grid. In islanded or autonomous mode, local loads can be supplied without using the distribution network [87]. The two operating modes of the microgrid are explained below. 2-3-1 Grid-Connected Mode In grid-connected mode, microgrids operate alongside the main utility grid, allowing for power exchange between the microgrid and the larger grid. This mode improves the reliability and stability of the power supply by offering additional support during peak demand and facilitating  39  the integration of renewable energy sources. Grid-connected microgrids can also provide ancillary services, such as frequency regulation and voltage support, contributing to the overall stability of the power system. Advanced control strategies are crucial for managing the seamless transition between grid-connected and islanded modes, ensuring minimal disruption and maintaining power quality. Recent studies have focused on developing robust control mechanisms to ensure the smooth operation of microgrids in grid-connected mode. These studies highlight the importance of coordinated control schemes that can manage the dynamic interactions between the microgrid and the main grid. For example, model predictive control and adaptive control techniques have been proposed to optimize power flow and enhance the resilience of the microgrid. Additionally, integrating energy storage systems is vital for balancing supply and demand, mitigating the intermittency of renewable energy sources, and providing backup power during grid outages [87]. 2-3-2 Islanded Mode If it is assumed that the distribution network is disconnected from the upstream grid for a long time and we want to operate the distribution network in islanded mode, any fault is likely to occur during network operation. According to IEEE 1547.4 standard [88], in the event of a fault in active networks, all energy sources and DGs must be disconnected from the circuit, and after the fault is cleared, energy sources and DGs are allowed to reconnect. Therefore, when a fault occurs in the network, the entire network shuts down for a while. To solve this problem, the microgrid structure has been proposed [89]. In islanded mode, load reduction/output is performed to maintain power balance. Critical loads are prioritized to receive high-quality power at all times, while remaining loads are subject to load shedding [90]. In islanded microgrids with typical loads (active or passive), frequency fluctuations are usually managed by droop control of active converters in grid-forming mode. The islanding capability of the microgrid allows for the supply of sensitive loads during main grid outages, increasing reliability for consumers within the microgrid [90]. The islanding process can be initiated by opening upstream switches at the substation that connect the main power grid and the microgrid. This change can occur due to any disturbance or intentional reasons. There is a difference between intentional and unintentional islanding.  40  Intentional islanding refers to a managed and controlled transition operation, while unintentional islanding refers to unwanted islanding due to a fault in the power grid. In islanded microgrid operations, the fault current level is low due to the absence of the main grid. Additionally, inverter-based distributed generation sources, such as distributed sources based on synchronous machines, cannot inject significant current during faults. Furthermore, due to the presence of distributed generation sources, the fault current direction in microgrids is bidirectional. This issue is more pronounced in microgrids with ring configurations [91]. If the unbalanced power within the microgrid is smaller than the available control capacity, transitioning to islanded operation is possible. This capacity includes feedback control of locally controlled DER units, sufficiently robust energy storage for rapid response, and controllable microgrid loads that can quickly disconnect from the main grid. Therefore, the transition is very easy due to the rapid communication between components and the management system [92]. Voltage source inverters (VSIs) are commonly used to connect distributed generation sources to the microgrid. These converters are very popular among industries and power companies due to their high flexibility in providing controlled and high-quality power to loads. This type of inverter can have either voltage control or current control. In voltage control mode, it generates a voltage with the desired amplitude and frequency, suitable for islanded operation conditions. In current control mode, the converter\u2019s output current follows its reference current, but the output voltage and frequency range are not controlled and are determined by the grid. Based on the points mentioned in this section, it can be concluded that one of the fundamental problems facing microgrid designers is the stable islanding of microgrids to avoid issues for consumers. Consequently, one of the important issues in this area is the control of distributed generation sources in islanded microgrids so that they can control the system\u2019s frequency and voltage and properly distribute the existing loads. In other words, the microgrid must be able to quickly manage frequency and power changes in the network. As a result, one of the main challenges of integrating renewable energy storage sources is the need for more flexible and coordinated frequency control mechanisms based on energy storage technologies to address voltage fluctuation issues in the microgrid, instead of using costly diesel sources for faster recovery and maintaining frequency and voltage stability.  41  2-4 Sustainable Energy Management in Microgrids To properly operate a network that includes more than two distributed generation units, especially in off-grid mode, power management strategy and energy management strategy are needed. Figure (2-9) shows the information flow and functions used in PMS/EMS for a microgrid.  Figure 2-9: Information flow and functions used in real-time PMS/EMS in a microgrid [92] In the figure, the real-time power-energy management block receives information about the predicted and real-time data of load, generation, and market, and based on this received information, sends appropriate control signals for load dispatch and load level determination [93]. The control structure in the microgrid is divided into two main categories: centralized and decentralized. Each of these control structures includes three hierarchical levels: 1. Distribution Network Operator (DNO), which can be accompanied by a Market Operator (MO).  42  2. Microgrid Central Controller (MGCC), which is also the microgrid operator. 3. Local Controllers (LC), which are related to each of the distributed generation units or loads.  Figure 2-10: Management and control structure in microgrids[93] The distribution company operator is at the highest control level, overseeing an area with more than one microgrid. Additionally, one (or more) market operator(s) for each specific area handle market-related tasks. The distribution company operator and market operator are not part of the microgrid but are dependent on the main grid. The microgrid central controller, or the microgrid operator, is the main interface between the microgrid, the distribution company operator, and the market operator. The microgrid central controller has various tasks, from maximizing the microgrid\u2019s value to coordinating between local controllers. Local controllers, which are at the lowest control level, control the distributed generation units and controllable loads in the microgrid. Depending on the control structure, each local controller may have a certain level of intelligence [93].  43  2-4-1 Control Methods for Microgrid Energy Sources In recent years, the analysis and design of large-scale systems, such as power systems with many renewable energy generators, have attracted the attention of many researchers. Uncertainty in the output of renewable energies causes frequency deviations in the entire power system. To achieve a reliable supply-demand system, advanced design and control methods are needed to stabilize power voltage in these systems [94]. Recent advances in computer network technology have enabled DER-equipped systems to operate spatially distributed. For example, in power system control, a system operator manages distributed power plants with distributed measurement units to meet the demands of several consumers. In line with the systematic control of such networked systems, decentralized and distributed control techniques have been studied over the past half-century. Recently, researchers\u2019 efforts have focused on designing suitable controllers for DER-equipped systems and extending these controllers to more general cases. The following sections review some control methods for these networks. Decentralized Control Decentralized control in microgrids involves each distributed energy resource (DER) operating autonomously using local data, without the need for a central controller. This method improves the reliability and scalability of microgrids by enabling the easy addition of new units with minimal changes. A significant benefit of decentralized control is its capacity to maintain system stability and performance even if communication links fail. Techniques like droop control, model predictive control, and adaptive control are frequently used to manage power sharing and voltage regulation in decentralized microgrids. These methods ensure that each DER can adapt to changes in load and generation, thereby maintaining the overall stability of the microgrid. Recent research has shown the effectiveness of decentralized control in both AC and DC microgrids. For example, a decentralized control strategy using optimal control techniques has been found to enhance the dynamic performance and stability of DC microgrids with composite loads. Additionally, decentralized control schemes for inverter-interfaced microgrids have been developed, employing model predictive control to manage interconnection couplings and improve system robustness. These developments underscore the potential of decentralized control to tackle the challenges of integrating renewable energy sources and varying load  44  demands, ensuring reliable and efficient microgrid operation. Figure 2-7 shows an example of decentralized control, including the system\u2019s inputs and outputs. Controllers are implemented in a decentralized manner, as shown in Figure 2-11 (a). The entire controlled system is represented by a repetitive feedback system in which structured subsystems are also connected to a base system. This issue is shown in Figure 2-11 (b). In practice, not only implementation but also controller design must be decentralized so that each controller is designed independently of the others. The most important point in designing decentralized controllers is achieving stability and proper performance in the entire controlled system [95].  Figure 2-11: Schematic of decentralized control of a power system comprising many renewable energy generators. The passivity theory has helped develop decentralized control schemes for systems with DER sources. Based on this theory, it has been proven that designing feedback controllers for linear and nonlinear systems is beneficial. Such controllers have been used in many applications, such as robotics and energy systems. Various efforts have also been made to develop robust and  45  adaptive controllers based on passivity. Additionally, many passivity-based control schemes have been designed in continuous time. However, it is well known that the passivity properties of continuous-time systems are lost under discretization due to energy leakage from zero-order hold. Therefore, various methods, such as using small sampling intervals where passivity is preserved under discretization, have been developed. A passivity-based control system design approach, or more generally, dissipativity, relates to the modular design of networked systems. This approach has the advantage that the input-output behavior of the entire networked system can be analyzed using only the subsystems, which are associated with compatible energy supply rates. However, analysis based on supply rates is only valid when an acceptable supply rate for the common variable, i.e., the stacked vector, disturbance and interaction inputs, and the common variable evaluation and interaction outputs, is found. Decentralized control in power systems with DER sources has advantages, including flexibility in the system structure, as each subsystem has a separate controller. With structural changes in part of the system, the controller for that part is updated according to the new structure, eliminating the need to redesign a central controller, which is very challenging in power systems with DER sources. Other advantages of decentralized control include fault tolerance, fewer computations, and no need for information from the entire system. As described, each local controller uses local signals and a small amount of information from other subsystems to issue commands. Many industrial systems are still controlled by decentralized architecture, where the control variable (input u) and the controlled variable (output y) are grouped into separate sets. These sets are combined to form non-overlapping pairs for which local regulators are designed to operate completely independently. These local regulators can be single-input-single-output (SISO) or multivariable, depending on the chosen input and output sets. An example of a decentralized control structure is shown in Figure (2-12), where the controlled system consists of two subsystems S1 and S2, with state variables and input and output variables (x1, u1, y1) and (x2, u2, y2), respectively, and the relationship between these subsystems is shown by the effects of two state variables [95].  46   Figure 2-12: Decentralized control structure for a two-input two-output system. When the decentralized regulatory structure is specified, and the internal interactions between the inputs and outputs of different pairs are weak, designing local regulators (R1 and R2 in Figure (2-12)) is straightforward. These internal interactions can be direct (input coupling) or created by the mutual effects of the internal states of the controlled subsystems, as shown in Figure (2-12). Conversely, it should be noted that strong internal interactions can prevent decentralized control from achieving stability or proper performance. As stated in [96], which examines various structures from the perspective of communication networks, more than two decades have passed since the application of this structure in power systems, at a time when communication networks did not allow for extensive information exchange.   47  Centralized Control In contrast to decentralized control, centralized control schemes are usually used to coordinate the control actions of the entire system, assuming that comprehensive information from the entire system is available. Centralized control means that information from the entire system is sent to a single center, where all control components are located, and that part is responsible for performing all computations, estimations, and generating control inputs for the entire system. There are important reasons for replacing centralized control structures with other structures, which are highlighted below. As the above definition indicates, centralized control is usually not feasible for geographically distributed power systems, and implementing this control structure for such systems is very challenging for technical and economic reasons. Sending information from the entire system to a single control unit and providing high computational power is practically impossible and costly. Additionally, designing centralized controllers is highly dependent on the system structure, and these controllers cannot handle structural changes in the systems and perform their functions optimally. Furthermore, the system may consist of separate and independent subsystems with unique control tools. Therefore, the best way to control such systems is to use local computing and control resources. As mentioned, power systems usually consist of many interconnected and interrelated subsystems, and therefore, control by a centralized control structure can be very challenging due to the inherent computational complexity required, resistance and reliability issues, and communication bandwidth limitations. Moreover, when central control in a centralized structure is lost, the entire system goes out of control, and control accuracy is not guaranteed when control components are lost. In some cases, comprehensive system information is not available to the central controller [97, 98]. For all these reasons, many decentralized control structures have been developed and applied to systems over the past forty years. Instead of designing a general and comprehensive centralized control scheme, decentralized control designs separate controllers for each subsystem. Subsystem controllers only need local signals and a small amount of information from other subsystems. Among the proposed structures, fully decentralized structures, distributed control systems with information exchange between local controllers, and hierarchical or tiered structures are of particular importance.  48  It should be noted that centralized control has the best performance in terms of functionality because fewer constraints are applied to the system. Therefore, simulation results in papers usually aim to bring the performance of distributed and decentralized control closer to that of centralized control. Hierarchical Control A point that emerges after decomposing a power system with DER sources into smaller subsystems is the interconnection and interaction between these subsystems. Each of these subsystems, which interact internally with other subsystems through their inputs or states, are \u201cneighboring subsystems.\u201d If the interconnection and interaction between subsystems are strong and cannot be ignored, decentralized control will not provide effective performance. Thus, the presence of a coordinator that provides the necessary information to each local controller is helpful. The hierarchical control scheme includes primary and secondary controllers. The secondary control level is a central controller that first receives the instantaneous output currents of all DG units via a low-bandwidth communication link (LBC). Then, the secondary control level calculates the instantaneous circulating currents corresponding to the main components and dominant harmonics and sends them to the primary controllers of all DG units to achieve accurate reactive power and harmonic current sharing and reduce circulating currents between units. Hierarchical control is a key approach for managing microgrids, which are localized power systems capable of functioning autonomously or alongside the main grid. This control framework is structured into three tiers: primary, secondary, and tertiary. The primary tier ensures voltage and frequency stability through local controllers. The secondary tier corrects any voltage and frequency deviations resulting from primary control actions. The tertiary tier optimizes the microgrid\u2019s overall operation, including power flow and economic dispatch, to achieve efficient and cost-effective energy management. Recent research underscores the success of hierarchical control in both AC and DC microgrids. For example, a hybrid microgrid model that includes both AC and DC subgrids has been created, showcasing the adaptability of hierarchical control strategies. These studies highlight the significance of incorporating advanced control techniques, such as model predictive control and machine learning, to improve the  49  performance and reliability of microgrids. By utilizing these advanced methods, hierarchical control can effectively manage the challenges associated with the variability of renewable energy sources and the dynamic nature of load demands [98]. Figure 2-13 shows the application of the hierarchical control scheme for a three-phase islanded microgrid where N three-phase DG units with inverter interfaces are connected to the PCC bus through LCL filters and feeder impedances ZF. It is worth noting that as long as they operate in parallel, the LCL filter is generally preferred over multiple VSI LC filters. Note that for DG units with voltage control, the capacitor voltage control filter inductances on the network side are considered part of the feeder impedances. Additionally, as shown in Figure 2-7, the microgrid system includes both linear and nonlinear loads, which are considered jointly at the AC bus (PCC) and locally at the DG output terminals. For each DG unit, the required power is supplied by power generators and/or energy storage systems. In the microgrid system, it is assumed that the DC links of the DG units are controlled and maintained separately.  Figure 2-13: Example of a hierarchical control scheme on a microgrid [98].  50  Distributed Control With the advent of new communication structures, the architecture and control structures also change. Hierarchical communication networks with physical subsystems at the lower layer and coordinators at the upper layer are replaced by distributed control structures. This structure will utilize graph theory, where the communication configuration is described by a directed graph, with each node representing physical subsystems along with their corresponding control units, and each edge representing a communication link. The most important issue is finding a communication topology for a given objective. Distributed control systems (DCS) have three main features. The first is the distribution of various control functions in relatively small sets of subsystems that are semi-automatic and interconnected through a high-speed communication bus. Some of these functions include data acquisition, data presentation, process control, process monitoring, information reporting, and data storage and retrieval. The second feature of the distributed control system is the automation of the production process by integrating advanced control strategies, and the third feature is organizing everything as a system. DCS organizes the entire control structure as a single automation system, where different subsystems are unified through an appropriate command structure and information flow. These features of DCS can be shown in its architecture, as illustrated in the diagram below. The main elements formed in DCS include the engineering workstation, operator station or HMI, process control unit or local control unit, smart devices, and the communication system. In the distributed control structure, local controllers decide for themselves which controllers to send information to and from which controllers to receive the required information, eliminating the need for a coordinating unit. In the distributed control structure, as shown in the example in Figure (2-14), it is assumed that some information is exchanged between local regulators (R1 and R2), so each regulator or controller has some information about the behavior and actions of other controllers. Figure (2-14) shows a simple system where controllers R1 and R2 are designed to control subsystems S1 and S2, respectively [99].  51   Figure 2-14: Distributed control structure for a two-Input two-output system.  In geographically distributed systems like transportation and power networks, which include hundreds or thousands of nodes, collecting all sensor information in one place for control is not feasible. In this case, distributed methods are needed that rely only on locally available information or information sent from nearby nodes, where some communication between nearby nodes is allowed. To understand the distributed control system, consider a system where a base system is involved by gradually connecting several subsystems step by step (Figure 2-15). Then, multiple subsystems are implemented in a decentralized manner in a base system. Additionally, the implementation continues as a modular connection. For practical reasons, not only the implementation but also the design process must be modular. This type of design is called distributed design, where each subsystem is designed independently of the others, except for brief specifications. Despite the difficulty of modular design, achieving stability and proper control performance for the entire control system is also essential [99].  52   Figure 2-15: Evolution of a base system \u03a30 with gradual connection of several subsystems  Robust control is an efficient method for designing distributed controllers. Within this framework, the networked system to be controlled is considered an interconnected system consisting of the desired subsystem and its environment, comprising other unknown subsystems with their interactions. Robust controllers are defined as controllers that can ensure the internal stability of the networked system for any environment, as long as the initial stability of the controlled networked system is maintained. By designing a robust controller as a sub-controller, each sub-controller can also implement its control policy independently of other controllers. All robust controllers can be specified through the Euler parameter with a linear constraint on the Euler parameter. Unfortunately, since controlling bounded parameters analytically is difficult, the general combination of the most robust controller cannot be done simply. Figure 2-16 shows a schematic of a robust control. Accordingly, \u03a32 in Figure 2-12 can be considered a networked system consisting of sub-controllers and existing subsystems, as its dimensions and structure have no limitations. Generally, the assumption that a complete system model is available for networked systems is unrealistic. Additionally, simultaneous design of all sub-controllers is generally difficult for controlling networked systems equipped with DER. Even if \u03a32 is considered model uncertainty, it is usually assumed to be normative in robust control. The robust control problem, searching for a controller that ensures the stability of the closed-loop system for  53  all possible \u03a32, so that the pre-existing system \u03a3 is stable, differs from typical robust control issues [100].  Figure 2-16: Schematic of signal flow in robust control [100].  Table 2-2: Comparison of different methods for energy management in micro-grids Method Properties Advantages Disadvantages Decentralized Each distributed energy resource (DER) operates autonomously using local data, without a central controller. - High reliability and scalability - Fault tolerance - Adaptable to structural changes - Limited computational needs - Limited by local information - Can struggle with system-wide coordination and interaction when communication links fail   Centralized A single control unit - Optimal performance with - High dependency  54  receives all system information, performs computations, and sends control signals to the entire system. complete information - Effective for unified control on central unit - Prone to total control loss in failures - Challenging in geographically dispersed setups Hierarchical Three-tier structure: primary, secondary, and tertiary controls to manage voltage, frequency, and optimize overall microgrid operations. - Efficient management of localized issues - Maintains stability across subsystems - Adaptable to hybrid AC/DC setups - Complexity in setup - Higher communication requirements - Limited flexibility in dynamic systems Distributed Control functions are spread across subsystems that communicate through a high-speed bus, often using graph theory for communication topologies. - Reduces central dependency - Allows local autonomy with some inter-subsystem communication - Can be complex to design - Dependent on reliable local and peer communications Robust Control Controllers designed to maintain system stability under uncertainties, with sub-controllers operating independently of one another. - High resilience to system disturbances - Maintains stability despite uncertainties - Difficult to design modularly - Performance may vary with large uncertainties  55  In summary, Chapter 2 has highlighted the critical role of sustainable energy management within microgrids and the diverse configurations and operational modes they offer. Microgrids stand out for their potential to improve energy reliability, reduce emissions, and support renewable energy integration, especially as distributed energy resources become more widespread. However, as this chapter has outlined, effective energy management in microgrids requires sophisticated control strategies to handle the variability in supply and demand while balancing environmental and economic goals. The insights from this chapter lay the foundation for the development of a multi-stage optimization framework, as presented in subsequent chapters, to address the complex challenges of microgrid management within active distribution systems.    56  Chapter 3: Electric Vehicles and Flexible Loads 3-1 Electric Vehicles In the past decade, air pollution has been recognized as the most significant environmental risk to health, causing the deaths of 7 million people annually [101]. Globally, 40% of premature deaths each year are attributed to prolonged exposure to polluted air. With increasing population in developed societies and rapid economic growth, air pollution has become a major pollutant, forcing governments to adopt effective measures to combat it. Human and developmental activities such as construction, production, and transportation, although primarily aimed at increasing efficiency and modernizing global communities, have led to increased pollution worldwide. These activities produce large amounts of waste and greenhouse gases, leading to ozone layer depletion, global warming, and increased diseases and deaths due to pollution exposure. However, the occurrence, distribution, and significance of dust production largely depend on meteorological and ground conditions at the time and place of activity [102]. Transportation systems include various modes of transport (e.g., buses and cars) and facilities related to boarding or alighting (e.g., stations). Exposure to air pollutants in these systems is very high. For example, the concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5) in transportation models is reported to be about 10-40% higher than ambient PM2.5 concentrations in some cities like Delhi, India [85]. Therefore, to combat global climate change moving towards sustainability, mobility is one of the most comprehensive approaches. Thus, decarbonizing the transportation sector using electric vehicles (EVs) is currently a safe and efficient solution for the environment. EVs include hybrid EVs (HEVs), plug-in hybrid EVs (PHEVs), and battery electric vehicles (BEVs). The widespread adoption of electric vehicles is possible with technological improvements and government support. However, the potential of EVs to save greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is debatable when the power required to charge EVs is supplied from traditional fossil fuel sources [102]. On the other hand, the shortage of fossil fuels and air pollution has increasingly concerned people, leading to more criticism of fossil fuel consumption in combustion engines. Electric vehicles are a suitable alternative to combustion engines to address these issues. These vehicles do not rely on gasoline or liquid gas as fuel but only use electricity stored in the vehicle\u2019s battery  57  as a kinetic energy source. Additionally, the rising gasoline prices have increased the motivation to use electric vehicles. Consequently, the automotive industry is undergoing a global transformation. Current steps to improve efficiency and reduce energy demand must be taken much deeper and developed to meet the conditions of the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS). Globally, transportation-related GHG emissions increased by 0.6% in 2018 compared to the previous decade, reaching 1.6%. As mentioned, the transportation sector significantly contributes to CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (i.e., 24% of CO2 emissions are from transportation). Vehicles such as personal cars, buses, trucks, and heavy vehicles account for nearly three-quarters of transportation-related CO2 emissions [103]. In recent years, the use of electric vehicles as an effective solution to reduce fossil fuel consumption in transportation has been widely welcomed by people and governments worldwide. Consequently, the number of electric vehicles is increasing significantly; according to reports from the International Energy Agency in 2016, the number of electric vehicles worldwide exceeded 1,000,000 in 2015 [104]. Electric vehicles have minimal emissions and play a significant role in reducing pollutant gases. Given the limited fossil fuels, using electric vehicles significantly reduces fossil fuel consumption. Additionally, electric vehicles are more efficient than diesel and gasoline vehicles. In diesel and gasoline vehicles, 75% of energy is wasted as heat and friction, and only 25% of energy is converted to wheel drive power. In contrast, only 20% of energy is wasted in electric vehicles. Since the number of parts used in electric vehicles is less than in conventional vehicles and they generate less heat, electric vehicles have lower maintenance costs than conventional vehicles. Additionally, in some countries, governments offer incentives such as tax and duty reductions for purchasing electric vehicles and providing facilities for their purchase. Another advantage of electric vehicles is that they can be charged from electricity generated by multiple sources. These sources include wind, solar, nuclear, hydro, and biofuels. Using these sources can reduce dependence on oil and gasoline, resulting in fewer fuel imports and lower imported fuel costs. The use of these vehicles in the transportation industry (public, goods, etc.) is increasing, and many studies have been conducted on designing and optimizing the performance of these vehicles. The main limitation of using electric vehicles is their low battery energy compared to fossil fuel vehicles, long recharge times, and limited refueling (charging)  58  stations. Since refueling these vehicles requires unique equipment and, unlike other vehicles (such as gasoline and diesel), they have limited refueling stations, the limitation of charging stations for these vehicles must also be considered. Another limitation of these vehicles is that their energy consumption depends on the vehicle\u2019s load, which imposes limitations in the real world. However, due to their positive impact on reducing air pollution, the design and creation of refueling stations are increasing. It is worth noting that reducing fuel consumption leads to lower service costs and, consequently, customer satisfaction [104]. 3-1-1 History of Electric Vehicles Regarding the history of electric vehicles, it can be said that hybrid and electric vehicles experienced a golden age around the 1920s, with approximately 34,000 units produced in the United States, roughly the same as the production of these vehicles in 2002 in the same country. If a reason can be found for these golden years, it can be attributed to humanity\u2019s limited knowledge of oil resources worldwide. It can be said that demand for vehicles was very high at that time, while the discovery of new oil resources did not match the demand for new vehicles, leading companies to produce electric vehicles. After that, research and studies related to these vehicles stopped due to the discovery of vast oil resources worldwide, and automakers focused more on producing fossil fuel vehicles [105]. Before the emergence of global warming, no one thought of producing electric vehicles on an industrial scale. The benefits of these vehicles include their environmental friendliness and simpler drive systems compared to their fossil counterparts. Additionally, the high efficiency of these vehicles should be considered, with electric vehicles having an efficiency of about 90%, while fossil fuel vehicles have an efficiency of about 30% to 35%, meaning fossil fuel vehicles have much higher energy losses than electric vehicles. From an energy consumption perspective, electric vehicles have higher efficiency, which is why they have attracted so much attention from automakers. As we know, one of the optimal energy management solutions is using electric vehicles. Electric vehicles have electric motors, and in these vehicles, the battery provides the electric energy for the vehicle. It can be said that electric vehicles are a new achievement in the automotive and transportation industry. Driving them is very cost-effective. Electric vehicles also have disadvantages that make their use challenging. Some of the main disadvantages of these vehicles are:  59  \u2022 Inability to charge batteries in all conditions \u2022 Dependence on fossil fuel-consuming engines [106] Batteries play a crucial role in electric vehicles because a significant concern for electric vehicle owners is the fear of battery depletion on the road. Therefore, battery manufacturers pay extra attention to the construction of electric vehicle batteries. There is always extensive collaboration between automakers and battery manufacturers in various countries. Considering the stated conditions, one of the goals in battery manufacturing is the cost of producing electrical power. Currently, this cost is about $500 to $600 per kilowatt-hour, which should decrease to $450 per kilowatt-hour by 2020. International agencies have provided significant support for electric vehicles to manage energy consumption, resulting in a curved trend in the sales and use of these vehicles compared to others. The following curves illustrate the importance and necessity of using electric vehicles in the future and compare their sales.  Figure 3-1: Projected sales of electric vehicles until 2050 [106]. Various countries have included the use of electric vehicles in their plans and are leveraging this technology to optimize energy management. Next, we will examine the impact of electric vehicles on distribution networks.  60  3-1-2 The Role of Electric Vehicles in Distribution Networks Energy loss and reducing energy consumption have become significant concerns for operators and energy consumers. With the increasing demand for electricity and decreasing available resources, optimizing its use and reducing losses in the power grid is crucial. Studies show that about 13% of the generated power is lost as ohmic losses at various transmission and distribution levels. Various methods are used to optimize distribution systems, primarily aiming to reduce system losses. Capacitor placement and reconfiguration are the main and common methods in this field. The high penetration of grid-connected vehicles in the transportation sector significantly reduces air pollution and transportation costs, especially in large cities. The main characteristic of these vehicles is the use of batteries as a source to supply all or part of the propulsion power. In general, using electric vehicles in the distribution network to charge their batteries creates negative effects on the transmission and distribution network. The impact of electric vehicle penetration on the distribution network varies, affecting charging patterns, charging speed, charging characteristics, power losses in the distribution network, driving patterns, demand response strategies to reduce load, driving distance, battery size, and tariffs. Researchers are pursuing solutions to these issues and programs to mitigate these effects. The widespread use of electric vehicles with new technology positively impacts the economy and the environment, as these vehicles significantly reduce air pollution and improve environmental conditions [107].  61   Figure 3-2: Distribution network with electric vehicle charging stations. 3-1-3 Equivalent Circuit Analysis with an Electric Vehicle The need for electric vehicle charging is inevitable and must be considered. A vehicle fleet includes an n\u00d7m set of electric vehicles based on VSC (Vehicle Stability Control) systems connected to a distribution network bus through a charging center transformer. Electric vehicles in the parking lot participate in the exchange of active and reactive power with the distribution system. While active power charging depends on the battery\u2019s state of charge, the amount of reactive power produced by the vehicle depends on the VSC\u2019s reactive power limits and the specified voltage at the voltage control bus. Since a dispersed vehicle fleet may include dozens of vehicles, it is more effective to replace a vehicle fleet with a single vehicle model for load flow analysis. The figure below shows a simplified diagram of a charging center.  62   Figure 3-3: Representation of an n\u00d7m vehicle fleet during charging. In the above figure, the distribution system and the charging center transformer are shown with abbreviations, and the operation of the charging support system can be observed and evaluated [108]. 3-1-4 Effects of EVs charging The deployment of a large number of electric vehicles in the electric grid demands additional power from the distribution network, and this increase in demand will bring many negative effects on the distribution network. These effects may vary depending on the level of penetration of electric vehicles, charging patterns, charging locations, driving patterns of vehicles, driving distance, charging modes, charging start times, battery SOC during charging tariffs, etc. The  63  effects of electric vehicles on the distribution network can be divided into two categories: positive and negative effects. The positive effects are actually the benefits of using vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, but the negative effects of electric vehicles on the grid include voltage instability, increased peak demand, power quality problems, increased losses and equipment overload, especially transformers, which will be briefly explained below. Regarding voltage instability, electric vehicles have non-linear load characteristics and take a large amount of electrical power from the network in a short period of time to charge their batteries. In other words, the amount of electric energy consumption by an electric vehicle cannot be accurately predicted. And for this reason, these vehicles have different load characteristics from other traditional loads in the network, such as industrial and residential loads, etc. Therefore, the effect of electric vehicles on the stability of the network voltage should be considered in an appropriate and related manner. Regarding the increase in peak demand due to uncoordinated charging and controlled charging, it can be mentioned that the deployment of electric vehicles on a large scale in the electric network will lead to an increase in peak demand. Several studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of electric vehicle charging on the peak load of the network. For example, reference [109] has shown that inconsistent charging of electric vehicles with a penetration level of 30% will increase peak demand by 53%. However, the reference [110] states that even the normal charging of an electric vehicle in normal conditions will increase the demand peak and for this reason, the concept of smart charging should be used. In terms of power quality problems, it can be stated that the mass penetration of electric vehicles in the distribution network can affect the quality of power supply. Because if there is a large accumulation of electric vehicles in the network, the charging demand may reach high levels. Unbalance and voltage deviation occur only in multi-phase systems due to the presence of non-uniform loads in the distribution lines. Shahnia et al. [111] analyzed the sensitivity of voltage imbalance by considering the locations and levels of charging and discharging of electric vehicles in a weak pressure distribution network show that electric vehicles have a small effect at the beginning of the weak pressure feeder and a major effect at its end. They proved at the penetration level of 34% of electric vehicles, the voltage imbalance index exceeds its allowed value in weak voltage networks, i.e. 2%. In addition, single-phase electric  64  vehicle charging will also cause an imbalance of phases due to the non-uniform distribution of the load in the three-phase system. Regarding the voltage drop, studies show that up to 10% penetration level for controlled charging and 60% penetration level for uncontrolled charging of these vehicles in the distribution network can perform optimally without any negative effect on its voltage [112]. In explaining the losses and the effects of coordinated and uncoordinated charging, it can be mentioned that one of the negative effects of mass penetration of electric vehicles in the distribution network is the increase in network losses. The conducted studies show that the penetration level of electric vehicles, charging mode, charging level (charging start time) as well as the use of uncoordinated and unplanned charging methods can cause adverse effects on the voltage profile and losses of the distribution network. On the other hand, using a coordinated and pre-planned charging strategy and using uniformly distributed charging methods to charge electric vehicles near production sources can minimize network losses. Also, the increase of electric vehicles in the distribution network increases the load on transformers, for this reason it is necessary to choose the appropriate capacity of transformers, optimal planning for the network and use of load management strategy to reduce the negative effects of electric vehicles [113]. Environmental effects of electric vehicles The use of electric vehicles, even with the assumption that the electric energy consumed by them is produced only by using fossil fuels in the thermal power plant and there is no other renewable production unit, it can still be environmentally and economically more suitable than internal combustion vehicles such as gasoline vehicles, because the production of mechanical energy in internal combustion engines takes place with a much lower efficiency than the production of electric energy in power plants. Also, when fossil fuels are consumed centrally in power plants and the electrical energy produced by them is delivered to electric vehicles, the management of pollutant emissions is much easier than when fossil fuels are consumed by individual vehicles with internal combustion engines [114]. Economic effects of electric vehicles From the point of view of electric vehicle owners, the fuel and operation costs of electric vehicles are lower than vehicles with internal combustion engines, because electric engines are more efficient compared to internal combustion engines. The efficiency of an internal  65  combustion vehicle is usually around 15-18%, while the efficiency of an electric vehicle is reported to be approximately 60-70%. In addition, V2G technology also provides the opportunity for the owners of electric vehicles to earn money through the exchange of energy stored in the battery with the network. From the point of view of the power supply network, the presence of electric vehicles in the distribution network increases the losses and costs of the entire system, however, the use of appropriate charging methods can significantly minimize the negative effects. For example, the use of controlled charging can reduce the costs and peak demand of the system by more than 50% compared to uncontrolled charging [115]. 3-1-5 Electric Vehicle Charging Electric vehicle (EV) charging is the process of replenishing the energy stored in an electric vehicle's battery by connecting it to an electric power source. This charging process is essential for the operation of electric vehicles, as they rely solely on electricity as their energy source. Here are some key aspects of electric vehicle charging: 1. Charging Levels: 1) Level 1 Charging: This is the slowest and simplest form of charging. It uses a standard 120-volt household outlet and is typically used for overnight charging at home. It provides a charging rate of about 2 to 5 miles of range per hour of charging. 2) Level 2 Charging: Level 2 chargers operate at 240 volts and are commonly found in residential garages, workplace charging stations, and public charging stations. They can provide a much faster charging rate, typically offering 10 to 30 miles of range per hour of charging. 3) Level 3 Charging (DC Fast Charging): Also known as fast charging or rapid charging, Level 3 chargers use high-voltage direct current (DC) and can charge an EV much faster than Level 1 or 2 chargers. They are often found along highways and major routes, and can provide up to 100 miles of range in as little as 20-30 minutes.  66  2. Charging Connectors: Different regions and manufacturers may use different types of connectors for EV charging. Common connectors include the SAE J1772 for Level 2 charging in North America, CCS (Combined Charging System) for DC fast charging, and CHAdeMO for DC fast charging, primarily used by some Japanese automakers. In the problem of electric vehicle routing, it is necessary to pay attention to the importance of battery charging stations. First, the warehouse should be equipped to charge vehicle batteries. So that the batteries of the vehicles in the warehouse are fully charged at night and start their journey with a fully charged battery. This action reduces charging costs. Secondly, in addition to the warehouse, public charging stations should also be installed at the desired geographical level. Among the most important limitations that distinguish the electric vehicle routing model from other vehicle routing models is the limitation of calculating the battery charge level at each node. Fast Charging Stations and Their Location With the growth of electric vehicles, access to the charging system of these vehicles becomes an emerging and important issue. The very large batteries of these vehicles have a length of about 1.7 meters and have a range between 5 and 30 kilowatt-hours. Accordingly, electric vehicles are considered a very large load for the electric network. Charging these vehicles with usual methods requires a lot of time. So that residential chargers spend about 14 hours to charge an electric vehicle with normal batteries [115], due to the limited capacity of home meters, we cannot quickly charge an electric vehicle with a normal battery capacity because the current consumption is much more than the capacity of the home meter. Therefore, fast charging should be proposed in the form of public charging stations. On the other hand, connecting these vehicles to the grid during peak times will increase the current of the distribution transformers beyond their nominal limits. This issue will reduce the expected life of a transformer and other network components. For the growth of electric vehicles, fast charging stations in cities are an important need, so that in addition to supplying energy to vehicles, it can bring peace of mind to citizens with electric vehicles. In these stations, vehicles are charged in about 10 to 15 minutes and reach 80 to 100% of the final charge, which is a relatively suitable time for electric vehicle owners [116].  67  Electric vehicle fast charging station can have one to several charging units like fossil fuel stations. Due to the high consumption of fast charging stations, these stations should be connected and fed to the medium pressure distribution network and substations. Therefore, the closer the charging station is to the distribution substation, in addition to reducing the connection cost, the losses in the network are also reduced. The most important issue in the construction of an electric vehicle fast charging station is to determine the right place to build and operate the station. The issue of locating the charging station can be examined from several perspectives. Since fast charging stations connect transportation and electrical networks, the location and size of this station has a significant impact not only on the driving behavior of vehicles, but also on the performance of these networks. Therefore, the location of the fast charging station should be done considering the presence of both networks. From the point of view of the electricity company, the best place to build a fast charging station is a place where the least losses occur in the distribution network and the least development in the distribution network in terms of adding a line, dedicated feeder or transformer, and on the other hand, the charging station can be easily connected to the network. From the point of view of the owner of the station, a place should be chosen where the costs are the lowest. Costs such as the price of land, the cost of connecting to the network, the cost of charging and maintenance units. Therefore, the station should be built in a place where there is the highest density of EVs. Generally, fast charging stations have a small or large number of charging units (capacity) according to the density of electric vehicles. It is clear that it is not logical to consider economic benefits alone to solve the problem in question, therefore, the main goal is to determine the optimal location and size of charging stations with the help of various optimization methods in such a way that both the total cost is minimized and the security of the power system is ensured. In order to achieve the desired goals, various methods have been used to solve the problem of locating fast charging stations, some of which will be presented below.      68  Types of Location Models of Charging Stations 1)     Location based on burgers In the location model of the charging station based on nodal demand, the current passing through the nodes is considered and it is assumed that the charging of electric vehicles that can be connected to the grid (PEV) occurs on some geographical nodes of the target planning area and the charging stations are located to meet the demand. However, this method only considers the geographical straight-line distance between the charging nodes, while the limitations of the density of the transportation network are ignored [117]. 2)     Location based on traffic flow In this planning model based on traffic simulation, it is used to estimate PEV charging requirements. Simulations are often based on data from real-world trips. Obtaining such data can be expensive for some areas. Considering the mobile behavior of rechargeable electric vehicles, some researchers proposed planning methods based on traffic flow. In this method, source and destination traffic flows are used to estimate charging demand which includes FCLM and FRLM. In the FCLM model, it is basically a flow-based route coverage maximization problem, which locates the p number of charging equipment to maximize the amount of routes covered by a charging station anywhere along the flow path (Berman, et al., 1992). The FRLM model, which is a modified FCLM model, is called the fuel-flow location model. Fuel-flow location locates a given number of stations in order to maximize route-based demands that can be refueled. The main difference between FRLM and FCLM is that in FCLM a flow is covered if at least one charging station is located anywhere along the flow path. But in FRLM, depending on the distance of the route and the maximum driving range that the vehicles have (assumed coverage area), a combination of two or more charging stations may be required to refuel and cover the flow so that the vehicle does not run out of fuel.1    1 Flow capturing location model  69  3-1-6 Wireless Charging of Electric Vehicles The wireless charging system is a more advanced generation of charging stations for electric vehicles. By completing the charging capacity of electric vehicles, you can only travel up to a certain distance and after that the vehicle must be connected to the electricity again. Therefore, it is clear that electric vehicle charging stations are installed in different places, just like gas pumps and gas pumps, and it may result in loss of time, both during charging and waiting in line, as well as energy loss. In other words, using the above-mentioned charging stations on the one hand limits us to time and place, and on the other hand, we cannot continue on our way until charging time, so the idea of wireless charging arose from these problems. In order to build wireless charging stations for electric vehicles, different ideas were studied, each of which was complementary to the previous ideas. For example, one of the ideas was the use of transmitter and receiver wires. In such a way that the receiver wires were embedded in the vehicle and one or more large transmitter wires were installed on the side or under the roads. This approach required high investment costs. Therefore, the researchers came to the conclusion to modify the wires of the transmitter and receiver. This means that the wires of the same size should be used in the transmitter and receiver. With the difference that the transmitter coil in the station can expand and control the field under its radius based on the reactance reflected from the receiver coil, thus the power losses will be greatly reduced and the destructive effects of the magnetic fields will also be reduced. In other words, when the electric vehicle approaches one of the wireless charging stations, the transmitter system will notice and increase its output power by 400%. When the vehicle is moving away, the transmitter waves gradually decrease. Therefore, not only it will not be dangerous for people's health, but less electrical power will be wasted [118]. A typical EV wireless charging system is shown in the figure below, which includes several steps to charge an EV wirelessly [119]. First, the AC electric power is converted into a DC power supply by modifying the power factor by an AC to DC converter.  70   Figure 3-4: A conventional EV wireless charging system [119].  Then, the DC power is converted to a high frequency signal to drive the transmission signal through a compensating network. Due to the insulation failure of the primary winding for added safety and protection, a high frequency isolation transformer may be placed between the DC-AC inverter and the primary winding. The high frequency current in the transmitter coil creates an alternating magnetic field that causes AC voltage in the receiver coil. By resonating the secondary compensator network, the transmitted power and efficiency are significantly improved. Finally, the AC power is rectified to charge the battery [120]. As a result, wireless power transmission has many components including: rectifier, power factor corrector, inverter, network compensator on the transmitter side, magnetic coupler (transmitter and receiver coil), network compensator on the receiver side and rectifier for DC chargers, an additional DC-DC converter on the transmitter side.  71  Various topologies have been presented in this field that define the connection method as series-series, series-parallel or vice versa and parallel-parallel [120]. Of course, it can also be considered as a compound, which includes SPS and PSP [121]. On the other hand, the compensation operation has been done so far based on the use of a coil, which can be done using only one capacitor or a combination of both with different LCL or LCC topologies. In the LCL converter, one or two LC network compensators are used on the sides. The advantage of LCL at the resonance frequency is that the current on the primary side can be independent of the load condition, and in other words, it can act as an independent current source. The LCC design requires an additional coil, which is usually an additional capacitor in series with the coil to reduce the size and cost of the additional coil, which is called the LCC model. Using LCC, a zero switch current can achieve the highest efficiency by adjusting the network compensator parameters. Therefore, when LCC is confirmed on the secondary side, the reactive power of the secondary side can somehow compensate and the distortion current may be reduced [122]. Figures 3-5 and 3-6 show the general LCL and LCC topology, respectively.  Figure 3-5: LCL compensated topology integrated circuit [122].  72   Figure 3-6: LCC compensated topology integrated circuit [122].  Static Electric Vehicle Charging (SEVC) One of the problems of electric vehicles is their maximum range, which is closely related to battery and charger technology. Fast charging, wireless charging and vehicle charging while moving are some of the proposed solutions. Recently, a new wireless charging system has been introduced that has high capabilities. Currently, the charging of electric vehicles that exist in the home environment and other places is generally done by a special relationship. Most of today's electric vehicles need a physical connection wire to fill the charge level of their batteries. However, in some areas, you can use wireless charging services for electric vehicles, but these devices can only charge the electric vehicle battery with a power of 3.3 kW. This amount of power is enough to charge electric vehicles during the night, but the main solution that can solve this big problem is the possibility of charging electric vehicles on public roads wirelessly and quickly. Fortunately, the results of recent research in this direction also show that this category of work will be offered in the near future. The figure (2-2) shows a local wireless charging station [123].  73   Figure 3-7: Static wireless charging station Dynamic Electric Vehicle Charging (DEVC) Paying attention to the current trend, there is no doubt that the future belongs to electric vehicles. Although these vehicles have many advantages, they also face disadvantages that have been mentioned before, among which the following can be mentioned. o Limited travel distance o Few charging stations o Relatively long time to recharge the batteries One of the ways to solve all three problems is called DEVC, and if implemented, it will provide the possibility of infinite distance travel for electric vehicles. This technology, which stands for dynamic electric charging of the vehicle. Using wireless charging technology, it can continuously feed the moving vehicle. The well-known company Qualcomm, which is known mostly for its mobile chipsets, has been researching a similar technology and has shown some of its findings. This American company, in cooperation with the French company Vedcom, designed a 100-meter test track in the city of Versailles to test its DEVC system there. In the figure below, the vehicle can be seen moving on the wireless charging station on the route.  74   Figure 3-8: A vehicle moving on a wireless charging station 3-2 Demand Response Demand response is one of the new developments in the DSM (Demand-Side Management) field, meaning consumer participation in improving energy consumption patterns. Demand response is generally defined as the participation of small consumers in the electricity market, facing real-time market prices, and responding to them. This participation occurs in response to prices that change momentarily. Additionally, incentive payments designed during times when wholesale market prices are high or when system reliability is at risk can motivate consumers to change their consumption. Therefore, the overall goal of implementing demand response programs is to achieve two important characteristics: network reliability and price reduction. According to the definition provided by the DOE in February 2006: Demand response is the change in electricity consumption by consumers from their normal consumption patterns in response to changes in electricity prices or in response to incentive payments designed to reduce electricity consumption (during times when electricity prices are high or system reliability is at risk) [123].  75  The overall goal of demand response is to reduce electricity consumption during critical hours. Critical hours are times when wholesale market prices are very high, or the system\u2019s reserve level is low due to unexpected events such as transmission line and generator outages or severe weather conditions. Two factors can lead to the acceptance of demand response by consumers: changes in electricity prices at the retail level, reflecting the variable nature of real electricity prices, or the implementation of an incentive program to encourage customers to reduce their consumption during critical hours. This incentive cost is separate from the regular price paid for electricity. This incentive can be a payment to the consumer for reducing load, a penalty for not reducing load, or both. Demand response is essentially a change in load consumption behavior in response to a stimulus. Demand response can result from rescheduling the production of an industrial consumer, readjusting the heating system of a commercial consumer, or direct control by the utility company over a residential consumer\u2019s water heater. Additionally, demand response can involve replacing electricity supplied by the power system with internal generation (using a backup generator for a few hours during peak load). 3-2-1 Importance of Demand Response: Today, load forecasting curves indicate a growing demand for electrical energy, which requires significant investments to meet this consumption. It is evident that in such conditions, demand response can greatly help solve this issue. Generally, the importance of demand response becomes clear when we realize the numerous financial and practical benefits it provides to consumers and even the network itself, such as reducing outages, lowering production costs, smoothing the load curve, stabilizing market prices, and more. In general, electrical power systems have three important characteristics, which include [124]: 1. Electrical energy cannot be widely stored at the power system level. Therefore, the available generation capacity at all times must be equal to or greater than the total load of the system\u2019s consumers. At certain times during the year, the system\u2019s consumption increases significantly, and without considering demand response, the required generation capacity to supply power and reserve for these hours will increase. 2. The installation cost of power plants is very high and time-consuming. However, by implementing demand response programs, consumption during peak hours by consumers  76  willing to reduce their usage decreases, thereby avoiding additional costs for creating generation capacity for a short period. 3. Electricity prices vary significantly at different times of the day due to changes in the system\u2019s load requirements during different periods and hours, as well as changes in available generation and transmission line capacity (due to unexpected events). During peak hours, more expensive units must be used to supply power, increasing market prices. Despite the variable market prices, consumers always pay a fixed cost (retail market price), which is the average cost of production, transmission, and distribution. This disconnect between the actual electricity price and the cost paid by consumers leads to improper resource use. Since consumers are unaware of the actual electricity prices at different times, they lack the motivation to align themselves with energy suppliers. Therefore, fixed electricity prices result in high consumption during peak hours (when the actual electricity price is higher than the average) and lower consumption during off-peak hours (when the actual electricity price is lower than the average). Consequently, electricity prices increase during peak hours due to the use of expensive generators for consumer power needs. Given the points mentioned above, using demand response seems necessary. For example, by implementing demand response programs, the construction of new power plants can be delayed, electricity production costs can be saved, and a balance between production and consumption can be maintained at all times. Additionally, demand response can increase system reliability. In this program, loads can reduce some of their consumption to address system or local capacity constraints. During emergencies or when the system\u2019s reserve level is low, the utility company must ration consumer power to prevent continuous outages and maintain system integrity. However, providing load reduction services by consumers reduces the losses caused by unwanted power outages. Voluntary consumer participation in balancing production and consumption during emergencies is more cost-effective and appropriate than mandatory cuts. Moreover, real electricity prices can be used to address limited system capacity issues. Consumers will respond to high electricity prices during peak hours by reducing their consumption. Consequently, applying wholesale market price changes to loads will reduce their  77  consumption during peak hours, lowering market prices during these hours and freeing up some system capacity (when the power system faces a shortage). Additionally, during peak hours, production companies may increase their proposed energy production costs to achieve higher profits (when most generators must be in operation to produce electricity), further increasing market prices. In such conditions, demand response can reduce this market power exerted by production companies and help stabilize prices. During peak hours, instead of using expensive generation resources, the capacity offered by loads willing to reduce their consumption can be used, thereby controlling electricity prices. 3-2-2 Types of Demand Response: Demand response can be broadly categorized based on how consumers participate in changing their electricity consumption patterns: 1. Price-Based Demand Response (PBDR) 2. Incentive-Based Demand Response (IBDR) Each of the above categories is further divided into several subgroups. It should be noted that some articles use the term \u201ctime-based demand response\u201d instead of price-based demand response [124, 125]. Additionally, some articles categorize demand response into various groups, including system and market-related programs, economic and emergency programs, or sustainability and economic-based programs [126]: Price-Based Demand Response: Most electricity consumers are unaware of prices that change momentarily and treat electricity as a commodity offered at a fixed rate. Therefore, they have no incentive to change their electricity consumption patterns in response to these prices. Economists believe that applying real electricity prices to consumers will increase efficiency. Price-based demand response programs create this incentive for end consumers, encouraging them to change their electricity consumption patterns. The use of these demand response programs has recently received special attention. If electricity price information is provided to consumers, they can control their consumption, reducing it when prices are high (and vice versa), thereby reducing their costs. This change in electricity consumption patterns in response to prices is entirely voluntary and carried out by end consumers.  78  In price-based demand response programs, no payments are made by utility companies to consumers for their participation. Consumers voluntarily adjust their consumption based on market prices, managing their costs. Price-based demand response includes time-of-use tariffs, critical peak pricing, and real-time pricing. It should be noted that some articles expand this classification to include critical peak day pricing and critical day pricing . Typically, demand response is implemented through an internal decision-making process by the consumer, and all actions to adjust consumption are voluntary. 1. Real-Time Pricing (RTP) As the name suggests, these programs use real-time prices as a signal for consumers to change their consumption. These hourly price changes reflect price fluctuations in the wholesale market, representing the actual production costs for all hours of the day. These programs provide a direct link between the retail and wholesale markets, and consumers are usually informed of the real-time market price a day or an hour in advance, adjusting their consumption accordingly. Generally, implementing RTP programs requires advanced metering equipment to provide consumers with hourly price information and measure their hourly consumption [127]. The RTP model improves market conditions by providing the necessary incentives for loads, preventing market power, stabilizing variable market prices, and enhancing system reliability. Additionally, RTP can reduce or shift peak loads like other demand response methods [128].  It is clear that this method and other demand response methods are not applicable for loads that cannot flexibly adjust their consumption. The RTP method is most useful for large consumers, as dealing with real-time wholesale market prices is practically challenging for residential consumers. Time-of-Use (TOU) Programs This program is one of the most common demand response programs among residential consumers. This method encourages customers to improve their electricity consumption patterns (using electricity during off-peak hours and reducing consumption during peak hours) by varying prices at different times. As mentioned earlier, the appropriate way to encourage customers to reduce their consumption is to inform them of the real electricity prices in the market and charge them accordingly. However, market electricity prices change rapidly, and if these prices are  79  applied as electricity tariffs to customers, the price changes would be instantaneous. It is clear that most customers do not have the time or equipment to respond to these instantaneous changes. Therefore, using several time intervals throughout the day to apply different electricity tariffs to these consumers seems more logical [129]. In the TOU method, electricity tariffs are set as different prices for various time intervals within a day. These tariffs are usually considered as the average cost of production and transmission of power in each time interval. TOU tariffs typically change from one time interval to another within a day or from season to season and are usually predetermined for several months or years. In this method, energy prices are typically calculated and charged in three states: peak, mid-peak, and off-peak, based on the different energy prices in each state. These tariffs can also be calculated for different hours of each day, different days of the week, or different times of the year. In other words, these tariffs can be daily or seasonal. These tariffs are widely used by large industrial and commercial consumers and require measuring devices capable of recording consumption in different time intervals (where electricity prices vary) [130]. The time intervals and electricity prices in each interval in these programs vary among different utility companies based on their daily, seasonal, and yearly peak loads. In other words, the goal of the TOU program is to create an incentive for consumers to shift their consumption from peak hours to off-peak hours, thereby reducing their costs [131]. Experience shows that using these tariffs in the residential sector results in a smoother consumption load curve. As an example of this type of tariff, Figure 3-6 shows the different tariffs set in Canada. In these figures, the 24-hour period of each day is divided into three categories: peak, mid-peak, and off-peak, depending on the season and whether the day is a working day or a holiday. As seen, in the first half of the year, there is one peak load corresponding to the hot hours of the day. However, in the second half of the year, there are two peaks during the day. This is because the days are shorter in this period, with the first peak in the morning and the second peak at noon. On weekends and holidays, due to the closure of commercial and industrial centers, electricity consumption is low, and as shown in Figure 3-6, these days are considered off-peak days. For the three considered intervals (peak, mid-peak, and off-peak), different electricity tariffs are specified. The electricity prices during peak hours are 9.9 cents/kWh, mid-peak hours are 8.1 cents/kWh, and off-peak hours are 5.1 cents/kWh.  80  For example, according to Figure 3-9, residential consumers can run their dishwasher at 9 PM (since this time is considered off-peak). Additionally, since weekends and holidays are considered off-peak days (due to the closure of commercial and industrial centers), using the washing machine can be postponed to these days.  a- First Half of the Year (May 1 - October 31)  b- Second Half of the Year (November 1 \u2013 April 30)  81   c- Weekends and Other Holidays Highest Price (Peak Hours) Medium Price (Mid-Peak Hours) Lowest Price (Off-Peak Hours) Figure 3-9: Example of TOU tariffs in Canada [131]. In addition to the mentioned advantages, TOU also has disadvantages. One issue with this program is that TOU has a static nature and does not differentiate between different days of a season (it sets fixed rates for consumers on days within a season), which may lead to a mismatch between actual peak hours and the hours specified as peak in the tariff [132]. For example, on July 7, the temperature may be very high (e.g., 40 degrees) during certain hours (e.g., 10 to 11 AM), increasing the use of cooling devices and potentially turning these hours into peak hours (while in the specified tariff, these hours are considered mid-peak). In contrast, on August 7 (the following month), during the same hours, the temperature may be cooler (e.g., 20 degrees), reducing the need for cooling devices. For instance, on July 5, 2003, in the PJM market, a comparison was made between the implementation of RTP and TOU programs, and the air conditioning consumption was calculated. The results are shown in Table 3-1:   82  Table 3-1: Comparison of costs in different programs Program Type Cost Fixed Rate 1928 TOU 1716 RTP 1317 As seen in Table 3-1, costs vary between programs. If a consumer uses the TOU program to reduce their consumption, their cost is 11% lower than using fixed rates. On the other hand, using the RTP program reduces system costs by 33% compared to fixed rates and 22% compared to the TOU program. Critical Peak Pricing (CPP) As previously mentioned, some loads cannot implement the RTP method. It was also observed that the TOU method applies price fluctuations in the form of several general tariffs to the loads. To meet the need to reduce consumption during critical hours of the year, when electricity consumption is very high (e.g., extreme heat) and system reliability is at risk (due to an unexpected event) or wholesale market prices are very high, critical peak pricing seems to be a suitable solution. The CPP tariff is essentially an additional tariff applied to fixed or TOU pricing during critical hours. This method has fewer economic benefits compared to RTP due to predetermined prices. However, this feature makes it attractive because, unlike RTP, it does not face the risk of sudden severe price changes. Although this program is part of price-based demand response programs, it is also categorized under reliability-based programs because it can be used when the system is at risk. Empirical evidence shows that these programs can significantly reduce loads during critical hours. For example, in California, using the CPP tariff resulted in a 41% reduction in loads from their normal consumption (without the CPP tariff) during a 2-hour period due to extreme heat. It is worth noting that without end-user control, this reduction was 13% over a 5-hour period [133]. Generally, CPP programs can be divided into four categories:  83  \u2022 Fixed Period CPP: In this program, the time and duration of price increases (during critical hours) are predetermined, but the days when critical peaks occur are not specified. The maximum number of days usually called during the year is also predetermined, and the occurrence of the event is notified to consumers on the same day. \u2022 Variable Period CPP: In this program, the time, duration, and day of price increases are not predetermined and are notified to consumers on the same day. This program is usually used in devices that automatically respond to critical peak prices (such as telecommunication thermostats). \u2022 Variable Peak Pricing CPP: In this program, the energy price during off-peak and mid-peak periods for a month or more is predetermined. The price during peak hours is determined based on the average price of the same day. This method has the advantage of creating a direct link between retail and wholesale market prices. \u2022 CPP with Critical Peak Rebate: In this program, the consumer pays a fixed rate for electricity consumption and receives a rebate if they reduce their consumption during critical peak periods. Extreme Day Critical Peak Pricing (ED-CPP) These tariffs are a type of CPP that considers higher prices for the entire critical day compared to regular days, and for hours of the day when electricity consumption reaches its peak, prices are significantly higher than other hours of the same day. Extreme Day Pricing (EDP) This program is similar to CPP in having high prices during critical hours. However, the difference is that CPP only includes limited hours, while EDP covers the entire critical day. These prices are unspecified until the critical day. Generally, price-based demand response programs cannot be immediately implemented for all consumers. In other words, conventional and traditional metering devices and billing systems are not suitable for such programs, and consumers cannot make daily and hourly decisions. Therefore, strengthening incentive-based demand response programs until price-based demand response programs develop can significantly help increase system efficiency and reliability.  84  Incentive-Based Demand Response Programs Incentive-based demand response programs create an incentive for consumers to reduce their consumption. Unlike the first group of programs, these do not deal with price signals but generally provide a suitable tool for load control in emergency conditions for utility companies and network operators to maintain system reliability and manage costs. These programs offer incentives for voluntary consumer participation in load reduction. These incentives are unrelated to electricity prices and may be in the form of discounts on subsequent bills, pre-arranged payments, or measured reduced load. Some of these programs impose penalties on consumers who commit to reducing load but fail to do so at the scheduled time [134]. In general, incentive-based demand response includes Direct Load Control (DLC), Interruptible/Curtailable Load (I/C), Demand Bidding Programs (DBP), Emergency Demand Response Programs (EDRP), Capacity Market Programs (CMP), and Ancillary Services Market Programs (ASMP). 3-2-3 Benefits of Demand Response Demand response provides numerous financial and practical benefits to consumers and even the network itself. The benefits of demand response are examined from the perspectives of consumers and the network. Benefits of Demand Response from the Consumer\u2019s Perspective Consumers participate in demand response to achieve economic benefits and prevent outages (helping to maintain power supply continuity). However, the main reason for consumer participation is generally to achieve financial and economic benefits. They usually contribute implicitly to improving network reliability. Therefore, these benefits can be categorized into financial benefits and reliability benefits. Financial Benefits The increase in fuel and electricity prices in recent years has created additional motivation for consumers to adjust their consumption. Consumers can reduce their costs by shifting their consumption to cheaper hours. Additionally, incentive payments given to consumers to keep their load ready for curtailment (or curtail it when necessary) can provide significant financial benefits.  85  Reliability Benefits Consumers, by responding to high prices, unintentionally improve network reliability and compensate for production shortages during peak hours (high-price hours), reducing outages and ensuring continuous power supply. Benefits of Demand Response from the Market and Network Perspective Demand response, through its impact on market operations, system reliability, and social welfare, creates network benefits that most or all consumers will benefit from. The main driver for implementing demand response programs is these benefits. These benefits can be divided into short-term and long-term impacts on the market and system reliability. Short-Term Market Impacts As previously mentioned, economists believe that optimal economic efficiency is achieved when the real price of a commodity is applied to its consumers. On the other hand, if the real price of electricity is applied to consumers, during peak hours when electricity prices are high, consumers will reduce or shift their consumption to other hours. This reduces the real-time market price. In electricity markets, part of the energy is traded in the form of long-term contracts. With the reduction in real-time market prices due to demand response, electricity prices in long-term contracts also decrease. This is because the risk of consumers facing high prices in real-time markets (if needed) is reduced, and if production companies are unwilling to sell electricity at lower prices in long-term contracts, consumers will prefer to procure their required electricity from the real-time market. Therefore, demand response programs generally reduce electricity prices in the electricity market, benefiting all electricity consumers (both participants in demand response programs and others). In California, a 2.5% reduction in electricity consumption reduced real-time market prices by 24%, and a 5% reduction in consumption caused prices to drop to 50% of their initial value in 2000 and 2001. Long-Term Market Impacts By implementing demand response programs, system peaks are reduced, reducing the need for building new power plants and expanding distribution systems.    86  Critical Peak Pricing (CPP) As previously mentioned, some loads cannot implement the RTP method. It was also observed that the TOU method applies price fluctuations in the form of several general tariffs to the loads. To meet the need to reduce consumption during critical hours of the year, when electricity consumption is very high (e.g., extreme heat) and system reliability is at risk (due to an unexpected event) or wholesale market prices are very high, critical peak pricing seems to be a suitable solution. The CPP tariff is essentially an additional tariff applied to fixed or TOU pricing during critical hours. This method has fewer economic benefits compared to RTP due to predetermined prices. However, this feature makes it attractive because, unlike RTP, it does not face the risk of sudden severe price changes. Although this program is part of price-based demand response programs, it is also categorized under reliability-based programs because it can be used when the system is at risk. Empirical evidence shows that these programs can significantly reduce loads during critical hours. For example, in California, using the CPP tariff resulted in a 41% reduction in loads from their normal consumption (without the CPP tariff) during a 2-hour period due to extreme heat. It is worth noting that without end-user control, this reduction was 13% over a 5-hour period [135]. Generally, CPP programs can be divided into four categories: \u2022 Fixed Period CPP: In this program, the time and duration of price increases (during critical hours) are predetermined, but the days when critical peaks occur are not specified. The maximum number of days usually called during the year is also predetermined, and the occurrence of the event is notified to consumers on the same day. \u2022 Variable Period CPP: In this program, the time, duration, and day of price increases are not predetermined and are notified to consumers on the same day. This program is usually used in devices that automatically respond to critical peak prices (such as telecommunication thermostats). \u2022 Variable Peak Pricing CPP: In this program, the energy price during off-peak and mid-peak periods for a month or more is predetermined. The price during peak hours is determined based on the average price of the same day. This method has the advantage of creating a direct link between retail and wholesale market prices.  87  \u2022 CPP with Critical Peak Rebate: In this program, the consumer pays a fixed rate for electricity consumption and receives a rebate if they reduce their consumption during critical peak periods. Extreme Day Critical Peak Pricing (ED-CPP) These tariffs are a type of CPP that considers higher prices for the entire critical day compared to regular days, and for hours of the day when electricity consumption reaches its peak, prices are significantly higher than other hours of the same day. Extreme Day Pricing (EDP) This program is similar to CPP in having high prices during critical hours. However, the difference is that CPP only includes limited hours, while EDP covers the entire critical day. These prices are unspecified until the critical day. Generally, price-based demand response programs cannot be immediately implemented for all consumers. In other words, conventional and traditional metering devices and billing systems are not suitable for such programs, and consumers cannot make daily and hourly decisions. Therefore, strengthening incentive-based demand response programs until price-based demand response programs develop can significantly help increase system efficiency and reliability. Incentive-Based Demand Response Programs Incentive-based demand response programs create an incentive for consumers to reduce their consumption. Unlike the first group of programs, these do not deal with price signals but generally provide a suitable tool for load control in emergency conditions for utility companies and network operators to maintain system reliability and manage costs. These programs offer incentives for voluntary consumer participation in load reduction. These incentives are unrelated to electricity prices and may be in the form of discounts on subsequent bills, pre-arranged payments, or measured reduced load. Some of these programs impose penalties on consumers who commit to reducing load but fail to do so at the scheduled time [136]. In general, incentive-based demand response includes Direct Load Control (DLC), Interruptible/Curtailable Load (I/C), Demand Bidding Programs (DBP), Emergency Demand Response Programs (EDRP), Capacity Market Programs (CMP), and Ancillary Services Market Programs (ASMP).  88  In conclusion, Chapter 3 has explored the critical role of electric vehicles (EVs) and demand response as flexible resources within modern power distribution networks. EVs introduce unique challenges and opportunities due to their energy demands, while demand response offers a pathway to balance these new loads with existing resources. Together, these elements enhance grid resilience and adaptability, though they require careful integration into existing infrastructure. This chapter has highlighted the potential for EVs and demand response programs to support grid stability, lower emissions, and improve overall energy management. The insights gained here set the stage for developing optimized control strategies in subsequent chapters, aiming to achieve a sustainable, cost-effective, and reliable energy system.               89  Chapter 4: Epsilon Constraint Method (Multi-Objective) 4-1 Optimization Problems The goal of optimization is to find the best acceptable solution considering the constraints and requirements of the problem. For a problem, there may be various solutions, and to compare them and select the optimal solution, a function called the objective function is defined. The choice of this function depends on the nature of the problem. For example, travel time or cost are common objectives in optimizing transportation networks. Selecting an appropriate objective function is one of the most critical steps in optimization. Sometimes, multiple objectives are considered simultaneously in optimization; such optimization problems are called multi-objective problems. The simplest way to handle these problems is to form a new objective function as a linear combination of the main objective functions, where the impact of each function is determined by its assigned weight. Each optimization problem has several independent variables called design variables, represented by an n-dimensional vector X. The goal of optimization is to determine the design variables such that the objective function is minimized or maximized. Different optimization problems are divided into the following two categories: a) Unconstrained Optimization Problems: In these problems, the goal is to maximize or minimize the objective function without any constraints on the design variables. b) Constrained Optimization Problems: Optimization in most practical problems is performed considering constraints related to the behavior and performance of a system, known as behavioral constraints, and constraints in the physics and geometry of the problem, known as geometric or side constraints. 4-1-1 Optimization Process The necessary steps to solve an optimization problem are as follows: 1. Formulating the Problem: In this step, a decision-making problem is defined along with its general structure. This general structure may not be very precise but describes the overall situation of the problem, including input and output factors and the objectives of  90  the problem. Clarifying and structuring the problem can be complex for many optimization problems. 2. Modeling the Problem: In this step, a general mathematical model for the problem is constructed. Modeling may use similar models from the literature. This step breaks down the problem into one or more optimization models. 3. Optimizing the Problem: After modeling, the problem-solving process generates a good solution for the problem, which may be optimal or near-optimal. It is important to note that the obtained solution is for the designed model, not the real problem. During formulation and modeling, changes may occur in the real problem, and the new problem may differ significantly from the real problem. 4. Implementing the Solution: The obtained solution is reviewed by the decision-maker and, if acceptable, is used. If the solution is not acceptable, the model or optimization algorithm must be developed, and the optimization process repeated [137]. 4-2 Multi-Objective Optimization Methods Multi-objective optimization methods are used in many branches of science and engineering when it is necessary to balance (trade-off) between two or more conflicting objectives to reach optimal decisions in a system. Undoubtedly, in many engineering applications, process and system designers make decisions based on conflicting objectives. For example, in car design, engineers aim to design a car with maximum performance while simultaneously seeking to design a car with minimal emissions and fuel consumption. In such cases, where more than one objective function needs to be considered, multi-objective optimization methods must be examined. The most important feature of such methods is that by using multi-objective optimization models, more than one candidate solution (a possible solution for the problem) is provided to system designers and engineers. Each of these solutions represents a balance between different objective functions. Even for a simple multi-objective optimization problem, the likelihood of finding an optimal solution that simultaneously optimizes all defined objective functions is very low. In many cases, the defined objective functions in multi-objective optimization are conflicting. In such cases, it is said that Pareto  91  optimal solutions exist for a multi-objective optimization problem. Theoretically, there may be infinite Pareto optimal solutions for a multi-objective optimization problem. 4-2-1 Basic Concepts in Multi-Objective Optimization The concept of scalar (numerical) optimality in single-objective optimization problems does not directly apply to multi-objective optimization. To understand the concept of optimality in multi-objective optimization problems, the concept of Pareto optimality must first be explained. In this section, concepts such as design space and criterion space (objective space) will be explained using the first example. Criterion Space and Design Space in Multi-Objective Optimization Problems In the first example, the design space of a multi-objective optimization problem was shown. Then, the set of feasible solutions (set SS) was defined, the contours of the objective functions were drawn, and finally, the Pareto optimal set (set SpSp) of this multi-objective optimization problem was identified in the design space. Another possible method for solving multi-objective optimization problems is using the criterion space. Alternatively, a multi-objective optimization problem can be represented in a space called the criterion space, where the axes are represented by the objective functions. For example, the figure below shows the multi-objective optimization problem of the first example in the design space.  92   Figure 4-1: Design space in a multi-objective optimization problem [137]. Figure 4-2 shows the multi-objective optimization problem of the first example in the criterion space or the f1-f2 plane. As shown in the figure below, the axes of this space are represented by the objective functions.  Figure 4-2: Criterion space (Objective Space) in a multi-objective optimization problem [137]  93  4-3 Epsilon Constraint Algorithm (\u03b5-constraint) Various techniques exist for solving multi-objective problems, one of which is the epsilon constraint method. This method was first proposed by Laumanns et al. (2006). It is used to create the Pareto front of solutions (set of solutions P) for a bi-objective problem. This method solves single-objective problems iteratively by selecting one objective function as the sole objective (f2) and setting the other objective function (f1) as a constraint, known as the epsilon constraint. In this method, one of the objective functions is considered the main objective, and the other objective functions are applied as constraints to the problem. Various developments have been made to the epsilon constraint method to make it more efficient, such as the extended epsilon constraint method mentioned in Mavrotas\u2019 paper. The steps of the extended epsilon constraint method are as follows [138]: \u2022 Step One: Select one of the objective functions as the main objective function. \u2022 Step Two: Solve the problem each time considering one of the objective functions, and obtain the optimal value for each objective function. \u2022 Step Three: Using the lexicographic method, determine the best and worst values for each objective function. The best value of the first objective function is equal to its optimal value when the problem is optimized considering the objective function individually. Then, optimize the second objective function with the constraint that the first objective function remains at its optimal value to determine the worst value of the second objective function. This process continues until all objective functions are optimized, thus determining the range for each objective function.  (1-4 ) max min[ , ]i if f  (2-4 ) max mini i ir f f= \u2212 \u2022 Step Four: Divide the range between the two optimal values of the secondary objective functions into a predetermined number of intervals (qi), and obtain a table of values for the epsilons.  94   (3-4 ) max *k ii iirf kq\uf065 = \u22120,1,..., ik q=       \u2022 Step Five: Solve the problem with the main objective function each time considering each epsilon value. The constraints related to the secondary objective functions are converted into equality constraints using appropriate surplus or shortage variables. By considering a delta coefficient between 10^{-3} and 10^{-6} for these surplus or shortage variables, the problem is solved, and efficient solutions are generated. The new problem is defined as follows:  (4-4 ) 2 32 2 23 3 3( ... )}( )( )( )pp p pis s sf x sf x sf x sx Xs R\uf065\uf065\uf065++ + += += += +\uf0ce\uf0ce \u2022 Step Six: Finally, report the found Pareto solutions. In conclusion, Chapter 4 has provided an in-depth analysis of the epsilon constraint method and its application to multi-objective optimization problems. This approach has been highlighted as a robust tool for addressing complex trade-offs between conflicting objectives, such as cost and environmental impact, in energy management systems. By converting secondary objectives into constraints, the epsilon constraint method enables the creation of a Pareto front, which facilitates the identification of optimal solutions for various objectives. The insights gained here are foundational for the development of a coordinated scheduling framework in subsequent chapters, where the integration of multiple objectives within networked microgrids is further explored. This serves as a critical step towards achieving efficient, resilient, and environmentally sustainable energy systems.   95  Chapter 5: Coordinated Scheduling of Networked Microgrids in Active Distribution Systems Considering the Economic and Environmental Impact of Electric Vehicles and Flexible Loads. 5-1 Introduction The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) have ushered in a new era of challenges and opportunities for modern power systems. Traditional power grids, designed for centralized, predictable generation, are increasingly inadequate for managing the decentralized and variable nature of renewable energy. This shift has led to the emergence of microgrids\u2014localized energy systems that can operate independently or in conjunction with the main grid\u2014as a vital component of future energy infrastructure. Microgrids not only enhance the reliability and resilience of power supply but also facilitate the integration of renewable energy and advanced technologies, such as EVs and hydrogen refueling stations. However, the successful operation of microgrids, particularly within active distribution systems, requires sophisticated management strategies that can optimize the use of diverse energy resources while balancing economic and environmental objectives. The coordinated scheduling of networked microgrids presents a complex optimization problem, involving multiple, often conflicting, goals such as minimizing operational costs, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and ensuring reliable power delivery. This complexity is further compounded by the need to account for the dynamic behavior of flexible loads and the variable availability of renewable energy resources. Chapter 5 of this thesis addresses these challenges by introducing a comprehensive framework for the coordinated scheduling of networked microgrids. The framework is designed to optimize the operation of microgrids within an active distribution system, considering the economic and environmental impacts of integrating EVs and flexible loads. The chapter begins by outlining the methodological approach used to tackle the scheduling problem, which involves a multi-stage optimization process. This process is grounded in the principles of stochastic programming,  96  allowing for the accommodation of uncertainties related to renewable energy generation and load demands. One of the key innovations of the proposed framework is its ability to simultaneously manage the distribution of power among multiple microgrids, taking into account the interactions between EV charging stations, hydrogen refueling stations, and other flexible loads. The framework leverages advanced optimization techniques, including the epsilon constraint method, to navigate the trade-offs between different objectives. By systematically exploring these trade-offs, the framework provides a robust tool for decision-makers to optimize microgrid operations in a way that aligns with both economic and environmental goals. The chapter also delves into the practical implementation of the framework, detailing the algorithms and software tools used to solve the optimization problem. The GUROBI solver within the GAMS software environment plays a central role in this process, enabling the efficient computation of optimal schedules under various scenarios. The integration of these tools ensures that the proposed framework is not only theoretically sound but also practically applicable to real-world energy systems. To validate the effectiveness of the coordinated scheduling framework, Chapter 5 presents a series of simulation studies based on a representative active distribution system. These studies demonstrate the ability of the framework to achieve significant reductions in both operating costs and GHG emissions, while maintaining or enhancing the reliability of power supply. The results highlight the potential of the proposed approach to contribute to the broader goals of sustainability and energy security, particularly in the context of the ongoing transition to a low-carbon energy future. In conclusion, Chapter 5 sets the stage for a detailed exploration of the coordinated scheduling framework, offering insights into how networked microgrids can be effectively managed within active distribution systems. The chapter not only addresses the technical challenges associated with microgrid optimization but also considers the broader implications for energy policy and planning. By providing a comprehensive and practical solution to the scheduling problem, this chapter contributes to the development of more resilient, efficient, and sustainable energy systems.  97  5-2 Service Area Detection This paper utilizes Graph Theory to incorporate scheduling constraints for establishing the range of microgrids. Binary variables are used to indicate the activation of each line or network bus. The constraints for determining the network graph are presented in Equations (1)-(3). Equation (1) specifies the requirement for each bus to be owned by only one microgrid. Furthermore, Equation (2) highlights that for a microgrid to possess other buses, the main bus with master generator must be active.

It is known that the operation of each line is feasible only if the two buses at the beginning and end of that line are part of the same microgrid. Hence, if the two buses at the beginning and end do not belong to any of the microgrids, it is possible to utilize the line. Additionally, to enable the scheduling for buses that are not currently planned, i.e., buses without any faults or interruptions, the logical operator has been employed. As this equation involves the product of two binary numbers, it can be linearized using auxiliary variables. A detailed explanation of how to linearize this equation can be found in [139].

Equation (4) sets one of the binary variables of power transfer ( , ,Linen m kI / , ,Linem n kI ) based on the direction of power transfer in active lines. Equation (5) indicates that each bus can receive power only from one of its neighboring nodes. Moreover, Equation (6) states that the base node in each microgrid, which is equal to the main bus, must not receive power from any other node.

Equations (8) express how this variable is calculated and its range is determined in Equation (9). The method of applying load control in the resiliency section is a stepwise function. So, loads at any point can change a percentage of their load in a certain number of blocks. Equation (10) states that only one of the load change blocks can be selected in the given hour and scenario. It is worth noting that there is a non-linear term in Equation (8) caused by the multiplication of two binary variables. The process of linearizing this multiplication using an auxiliary variable is illustrated in Equations (11)-(14).

It is important to maintain the initial energy level at the end of the planning period, as expressed in Equation (24). To avoid simultaneous charging and discharging, Equation (25) is employed [140].

This factor similarly accounts for losses incurred during the energy discharge process. \u2206\ud835\udc61 is time step increment, representing the duration of each simulation interval within which power flows into or out of the storage system are calculated. In Equations (25) to (29), the same set of equations are presented for utilizing the electric vehicle batteries. Equation (30) specifies that the battery's charge level upon entering the parking lot should be the same as its initial value (initial value randomly selected between 30% and 40%). In addition, Equation (31) indicates that the battery of EVs should be charged to a certain level (FinalevE ) before leaving the parking lot. Equations (32) and (33) are used to prevent simultaneous charging and discharging of the car battery and to ensure that the car is in the parking lot during charging or discharging.

Equation (34) within this operational structure serves to compute the quantity of hydrogen produced by these small-scale P2H units. Meanwhile, constraint (35) puts a cap on the electrolyzer's power consumption, ensuring operational efficiency within set limits. The dynamics of hydrogen storage are managed through Eq. (36), where the current hour's hydrogen tank level is calculated by considering its previous level, injection, and extraction rates. Specific parameters such as hydrogen constants, internal tank temperatures, tank capacity, and the molar mass of hydrogen play crucial roles within these computations. Constraints (37) and (38) work to restrict the hydrogen levels during station operations within predefined thresholds, ensuring safe and efficient storage practices. Furthermore, Eq. (39) outlines the possibility of redirecting surplus power generated by solar panels to either the electrolyzer for hydrogen production or selling it back to the grid. ,,El Els tEls t H2PHLHV\uf068=  (34) , ,s ,El Min El El Maxs t sP P P\uf0a3 \uf0a3  (35) , , 1 , ,H HH H El Chs t s t s t fcv tH HfcvsR TE E H H2U M\u2212\uf0e6 \uf0f6= + \u2212\uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf0e8 \uf0f8\uf0e5  (36) ,, 24 , 0 ,H H H Initials t s t s tE E E= == =  (37) , ,,H2 Min H2 H2 Maxs s t sE E E\uf0a3 \uf0a3  (38) , , ,Solar El Sellpv t s t s tpvP P P= +\uf0e5  (39)    102  5-2-4 Power Balance The balance of active load in microgrids is described in Equation (40). To determine the correct load distribution method, Equation (41) is utilized to calculate the passing power of the lines. It is important to note that load spreading was used at the first level to solve the problem. Lastly, Equation (42) models the limit of power that can pass through the lines.

Specifically, Equations (48)-(50) account for the gas turbine capacity in each microgrid, subject to unit commitment constraints. To minimize abrupt changes in power output over consecutive hours, Equations (51) and (52) are introduced. Moreover, the startup and shutdown costs are  103  factored into the model, and represented by Equations (53) and (54), respectively. The overall operation cost of gas turbines is then computed using Equation (55).

The relationship between the power flowing through the lines and the state variable of the lines ( ,l kB ) is expressed in equations (61) and (62). Additionally, voltage magnitude and angle limits are presented in equations (63) and (64), respectively [141].

These functions are presented in Eqs.

The  105  power plant cost in this study includes the fuel cost function as well as startup and shutdown costs. Multi-objective Modeling The \u03b5-constraint method is a commonly used technique in multi-objective optimization where one objective function is prioritized over the others. In this method, the main objective function is formulated as the optimization objective, while the other objective functions are introduced as constraints [145]. This approach allows the decision-maker to balance trade-offs between multiple objectives by adjusting the constraint values. The equations used in the \u03b5-constraint method for energy management systems can be expressed as follows: (68) 1 2 2 3,Z Z\uf046 = \uf046 =  (69) 1min( )OF = \uf046  (70) 2Equal & Unequal Equations\uf065\uf046 \uf0a3\uf0ec\uf0ed\uf0ee The objective is to minimize the total cost subject to an emission constraint (70), which is set to a value \u03b5. This approach allows for the optimization of the energy management system to balance the economic efficiency and environmental impact of the system. By adjusting the value of \u03b5, the decision-maker can find a solution that satisfies the emission constraint while minimizing the total cost of the system.  5-6 Methodology In this paper, a stochastic two-step method for configuring and managing microgrids in distribution networks is proposed. The first stage involves determining the operating range of each microgrid by considering its disconnection from the main grid. The structure and protection characteristics of the grid are used to form microgrids, with the main goal of supplying the highest possible load using existing power plants. Once the microgrids are formed, information on the equipment in each microgrid is determined, including the number of covered buses, controllable resources, and EV/FCV parking. In the second stage, energy management for each microgrid is performed independently, and the operation of the equipment is determined. In this  106  stage, the microgrid is not in emergency mode and can exchange power with the main grid. Therefore, each microgrid plans to minimize cost and pollution based on its load. The demand side management (DSM) is used in the form of flexible loads and smart charging to increase the flexibility of the system in the second stage. Figure 5-1 illustrates the steps of the proposed model.  107   Figure 5-1: Flowchart of the proposed model  108  5-7 Results 5-7-1 Test Network In this paper, a test network consisting of a modified IEEE118-bus distribution network is utilized, which comprises 3 feeders, 118 buses, 3 circuit breakers, 31 switches, and 9 tie lines [146]. The network has an active and reactive power demand of 22.71 MW and 17.04 MVAR, respectively. The information regarding the location and capacity of distributed generation units, wind turbines, and energy storage systems can be found in Table 1. It is noteworthy that out of 14 existing DG units, only 7 of them can act as master units, resulting in a maximum of 7 microgrids that can be formed. Table (5-1) illustrates the technical specifications of all system components used in this study. Additionally, to enhance the flexibility of the system, the total load of each bus is divided into five equal blocks, which can be managed through demand response programs. It is important to note that the storage systems are assumed to be located adjacent to the renewable sources, and their capacity is set to be equal to 30% of the capacity of the corresponding renewable source. This configuration allows for the efficient integration of renewable sources with the storage systems, enabling them to store excess energy and supply it during periods of low production.

To cover the uncertainties, 20 scenarios have been considered for each of the three variables [147]. Figure 5-2 illustrates the hourly curves for different scenarios, which have been used to evaluate the proposed method's performance under various conditions.

The first and second cases analyze the impact of EV parking on the service area, while the third and fourth cases examine the benefits of using the multi-objective model. Through these cases, this study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the proposed model's effectiveness in addressing the challenges of EV integration in power systems.     111  Table 5-2: Information on case studies Case No. Stage 1 Stage 2 DERs EV Parking Objectives DERs EV Parking Cost Emission 1 \u2713 \uf0fb - - - - 2 \u2713 \u2713 - - - - 3 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \uf0fb 4 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713  In the study conducted on the IEEE118-bus distribution network, the incident considered is hurricane. This situation causes several nodes and network lines to be disrupted, leading to a part of the system entering an islanded condition depending on the performance of the protection system. With the proposed model, it is possible to supply the load with minimal lost load during this situation. The simulation process involves the formation of microgrids that can be implemented in different scenarios to achieve the highest level of resiliency. Figure 5-3 presents the specifications of the network under investigation, highlighting the automatic network switches in green. The Tie-lines are depicted in red and marked with a dotted line. It is worth noting that all Tie-lines in this network have automatic switches. The identified error in the network pertains to the disconnection of the two main feeders, feeder 1 (between bus 1 and 2) and feeder 2 (between bus 1 and 63).  112   Figure 5-3:  Modified IEEE 118-bus test system 5-7-3 Results of the First Stage in Cases 1 and 2 The impact of hurricanes on the IEEE118-bus distribution network was analyzed in this study. As a result of this incident, several nodes and network lines were disrupted, causing a part of the system to enter an islanded condition depending on the performance of the protection system. The proposed model was implemented to supply the load with the least amount of lost load. In the simulation process, microgrids were formed, which can be implemented in different scenarios and have the highest level of resiliency. As depicted in Figure 5-3, two feeders (1 and 2) were disconnected from the main grid. Meanwhile, feeder 3 remained unaffected and worked without fault. Two microgrids were formed in the faulty area, and 61 out of 87 faulty buses were recovered. The structure of the microgrids are presented in Figure 5 with purple and blue color, respectively. The active power provided in this case was 7956.162 kW. The details of the formed microgrids are listed in Table 5-3.   113  Table 5-3.

The coverage range expands due to the presence of EV parking. The underlying reason for this expansion is the potential for smart charging of electric vehicles, which can lead to a reduction in the peak load of the network. Consequently, the service area can be extended while still maintaining the desired recovery percentage.  115  Table 5-4 showcases the numerical outcomes of the second case. As evidenced by the table, the amount of load recovery in two microgrids has notably improved, with an increase of 2.105% and 1.7%, respectively. Furthermore, each microgrid has expanded its coverage area by adding 12 more load points. Based on the findings, it can be inferred that adjusting the charging pattern and location of EVs can significantly enhance the network's utility conditions during emergency scenarios.

It is important to note that all the results obtained in this stage are based on the findings from case 2. Single-Objective (Case 3) In case 3, scheduling was performed to minimize the overall cost of the system. The total cost of the system under this scenario amounts to 51266.274 $, with an estimated emission of 46377.314 kg. Figure 5-8 displays the hourly power exchange diagram with the main grid.  Figure 5-8: Hourly exchange of power with the main grid in case 3 Figure 5-8 indicates that the amount of energy purchased during the early hours of the day was higher than during peak hours. This is attributable to the charging of EVs and EESs during off-peak hours, which is economically advantageous due to the lower electricity prices. Figure 5-9 illustrates the state of charge (SoC) of EESs for each microgrid.  118   a) MG 1  b) MG 2 Figure 5-9: SoC of storage systems in microgrids in case 3 To examine the influence of flexible loads and smart charging as a demand response program (DRP) on the operating costs of each microgrid, Table 5-5 presents the results of the problem solution with and without load control. The findings reveal a substantial decrease in operating costs in the presence of the load control program. As shown in Table 5-5, implementing load control has not only lowered the costs of energy production and purchase but has also increased the revenue from selling energy to the primary grid. The operating costs without load control were calculated to be 53833.518 $.  119  Table 5-5: Impact of load control on energy management Without Load Control MG No. Generation ($) Power Exchange ($) Total ($) Buy Sell MG 1 21381.911 15240.372 54.172 36676.455 MG 2 9630.392 7526.671 0 17157.063 With Load Control MG No. Generation ($) Power Exchange ($) Total ($) Buy Sell MG 1 20097.113 14121.975 696.551 34915.639 MG 2 9046.048 7012.834 291.753 16350.635  Multi-Objective (Case 4) Table 5-7 presents the results of the multi-objective model that used the \u03b5-constraint method. To form the Pareto front and identify the best solution, we used the fuzzy satisfaction method. The optimal solution is highlighted in bold in Table 5-6. Notably, the multi-objective model yielded a higher operating cost compared to the single-objective model. This is because the multi-objective model included modeling emissions as a separate objective function to reduce emissions. The optimal points for the \u03b5-constraint method are 52309.464 $ and 23590.434 kg for cost and emission, respectively. The optimal points and the Pareto front curve for the two solution methods are depicted in Figure 5-10.

Cost-emission pareto front in case 4  121  In summary, Chapter 5 has introduced a comprehensive framework for the coordinated scheduling of networked microgrids, addressing both economic and environmental challenges in modern power distribution systems. Through simulations on a representative test network, the proposed model demonstrated substantial reductions in operational costs and greenhouse gas emissions, validating the effectiveness of this multi-objective approach. By integrating flexible loads, electric vehicles, and hydrogen refueling stations, this framework not only enhances grid resilience but also aligns with sustainable energy goals. These findings lay the groundwork for future chapters, where further refinements and applications of this model will be explored, contributing to the broader goal of developing adaptable, efficient, and low-carbon energy systems.                  122  Chapter 6: Conclusion and Future Works 6-1 Conclusion In this thesis, a comprehensive framework for the coordinated scheduling of networked microgrids in active distribution systems has been developed, with a particular focus on the integration of electric vehicles (EVs), hydrogen refueling stations, and flexible loads. The research directly addresses several of the critical challenges facing modern power systems, particularly those associated with the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and the growing demand for EV infrastructure. The widespread adoption of renewable energy has introduced variability and unpredictability into power generation, while the rise of electric vehicles has created new patterns of energy consumption. These developments are reshaping the structure and operation of traditional power systems, pushing the need for innovative solutions that can adapt to this new energy landscape. By employing a two-stage stochastic programming approach, this thesis provides a robust and flexible solution for optimizing microgrid operations. This framework effectively balances economic and environmental objectives, addressing the inherent challenges that arise from the integration of intermittent renewable energy and the fluctuating demand patterns introduced by EVs. The first stage of the framework focuses on delineating service areas for microgrids, ensuring that the design takes into account security constraints, especially during emergency conditions. The second stage optimizes energy management by integrating renewable resources, EV charging stations, hydrogen refueling stations, and flexible loads. One of the key aspects of this research is the development of a multi-objective optimization model that manages the complexities of microgrid operations. The model not only accommodates the integration of renewable energy sources, EV and fuel cell vehicle (FCV) charging stations, but also includes flexible loads to optimize the overall energy distribution within the network. The complexity of modern microgrids lies in the need to manage multiple, and often conflicting, objectives: minimizing operational costs while ensuring system reliability, maximizing the use of renewable resources, and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The multi-objective optimization model developed in this research offers a structured and practical approach to navigating these challenges.  123  The simulation results clearly demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework, showcasing significant reductions in both operational costs and emissions. Specifically, the incorporation of flexible loads and smart charging strategies for EVs and FCVs has resulted in a reduction in operating costs by approximately 4.77%, while emissions have decreased by an impressive 49.13%. These outcomes underscore the potential for substantial cost savings and environmental benefits through strategic energy management practices within microgrids. The ability to balance economic and environmental objectives makes this framework particularly relevant for power system operators who must comply with both budgetary constraints and environmental regulations. The successful application of the GUROBI solver within the GAMS software environment validates the practicality and effectiveness of the model. This solver enables the efficient handling of complex optimization problems, ensuring that the framework can be scaled to manage large networks of interconnected microgrids. The flexibility and robustness of the model make it adaptable to different grid configurations, renewable energy penetration levels, and geographic contexts, making it applicable to a wide range of real-world scenarios. A significant focus of this thesis has been the consideration of emergency scenarios, such as grid outages or natural disasters, which can compromise the stability of power systems. By delineating the service areas of microgrids and incorporating security constraints, the framework ensures that critical loads can be prioritized, and microgrids can continue to function independently if disconnected from the main grid. This aspect of the research highlights the importance of resilience in microgrid design. As climate change leads to more frequent and severe weather events, the ability to maintain power supply during emergencies is becoming increasingly vital. The findings of this thesis have far-reaching implications for the future of energy systems, especially in the context of the growing integration of renewable energy sources and the widespread adoption of electric vehicles. The research demonstrates that well-designed microgrids, equipped with advanced energy management systems, can significantly enhance the resilience, reliability, and sustainability of power distribution networks. By optimizing the use of renewable energy sources and flexible loads, microgrids can reduce reliance on fossil fuel-based power generation, lower operational costs, and minimize carbon emissions. These outcomes  124  align with global efforts to transition to cleaner, more efficient energy systems, particularly in light of the urgent need to address climate change and meet international sustainability goals. The integration of hydrogen refueling stations and EV charging infrastructure into microgrid operations introduces new opportunities for energy storage and distribution. Hydrogen refueling stations, for example, offer a promising solution for storing excess renewable energy in the form of hydrogen, which can then be converted back into electricity when needed or used as a clean fuel source. This capability enhances the flexibility of the grid, allowing for more effective management of supply and demand fluctuations. The potential for hydrogen to act as both an energy carrier and storage medium makes it a key player in the future of sustainable energy systems. Additionally, the widespread adoption of EVs creates both challenges and opportunities for grid management. The increased demand for electricity to charge EVs can strain the grid, particularly during peak hours. However, EVs also represent a distributed energy resource, with the potential to provide power back to the grid during periods of high demand through vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology. Moreover, the potential for microgrids to contribute to energy security is strongly emphasized in this research. In regions prone to grid instability, natural disasters, or geopolitical tensions, microgrids provide a level of energy autonomy that can mitigate the impacts of large-scale outages. By allowing communities, businesses, and critical infrastructure to maintain power independently of the central grid, microgrids enhance the resilience of power systems. This capability is particularly valuable in remote or underserved regions, where access to reliable electricity is often limited. While this thesis lays a strong foundation for optimizing microgrid operations, several areas merit further exploration. One promising avenue for future research is the integration of advanced energy storage technologies, such as solid-state batteries and supercapacitors. These technologies offer improved energy density, faster response times, and longer lifespans compared to traditional battery systems, making them ideal for use in microgrids. The incorporation of such storage technologies could further enhance the efficiency, reliability, and flexibility of microgrids, particularly in managing the variability of renewable energy sources.  125  Incorporating machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) into the energy management framework could also greatly improve predictive capabilities, resource allocation, and decision-making processes in real-time. AI-driven energy management systems have the potential to optimize the operation of microgrids by learning from past data, predicting future energy consumption patterns, and dynamically adjusting energy distribution strategies. These capabilities would make microgrids more adaptive to changing conditions, whether they be fluctuations in renewable energy generation or sudden increases in demand. Additionally, AI could improve the resilience of microgrids by enabling faster and more accurate responses to unforeseen events, such as equipment failures or grid disruptions. Additionally, testing the scalability and adaptability of the proposed framework in diverse geographic regions and grid configurations would provide valuable insights into the practical challenges of real-world implementation. Different regions have varying renewable energy potentials, grid infrastructure, and regulatory environments, all of which can impact the performance of microgrids. Conducting pilot projects in a variety of settings would help refine the model and ensure its broader applicability. Furthermore, engaging with local stakeholders, such as utilities, governments, and community groups, would provide a more holistic understanding of the social, economic, and environmental benefits of microgrids. In conclusion, this thesis makes a significant contribution to the field of sustainable energy management by offering a comprehensive framework for the coordinated scheduling of networked microgrids. The findings highlight the potential of microgrids to improve system reliability, reduce operational costs, and lower emissions, making them an essential component of future power distribution networks. By addressing both economic and environmental objectives, this research offers a pathway toward more resilient and sustainable energy systems, capable of meeting the demands of an evolving energy landscape. The integration of advanced energy storage technologies, flexible loads, and smart EV charging strategies will be critical in shaping the future of microgrid operations. As the energy sector continues to transition toward a more decentralized and renewable-driven model, the contributions of this thesis provide valuable insights and practical solutions for optimizing the operation of microgrids in active distribution systems.  126  6-2 Research Contribution This thesis makes several significant contributions to the field of sustainable energy management, particularly in the context of networked microgrids within active distribution systems.

      "abstract": "In this thesis, we mainly discuss four topics on Electric Vehicles (EVs) in the context of\n\nsmart grid and smart transportation systems.\n\nThe first topic focuses on investigating the impacts of different EV charging strategies on\n\nthe grid. In Chapter 3, we present a mathematical framework for formulating different EV\n\ncharging problems and investigate a range of typical EV charging strategies with respect to\n\ndifferent actors in the power system. Using this framework, we compare the performances of\n\nall charging strategies on a common power system simulation testbed, highlighting in each\n\ncase positive and negative characteristics.\n\nThe second topic is concerned with the applications of EVs with Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)\n\ncapabilities. In Chapter 4, we apply certain ideas from cooperative control techniques to\n\ntwo V2G applications in different scenarios. In the first scenario, we harness the power\n\nof V2G technologies to reduce current imbalance in a three-phase power network. In the\n\nsecond scenario, we design a fair V2G programme to optimally determine the power dispatch\n\nfrom EVs in a microgrid scenario. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms are verified\n\nthrough a variety of simulation studies.\n\nThe third topic discusses an optimal distributed energy management strategy for power\n\ngeneration in a microgrid scenario. In Chapter 5, we adapt the synchronised version of the\n\nAdditive-Increase-Multiplicative-Decrease (AIMD) algorithms to minimise a cost utility\n\nfunction related to the power generation costs of distributed resources. We investigate the\n\nAIMD based strategy through simulation studies and we illustrate that the performance of\n\nthe proposed method is very close to the full communication centralised case. Finally, we\n\nshow that this idea can be easily extended to another application including thermal balancing\n\nrequirements.\n\nThe last topic focuses on a new design of the Speed Advisory System (SAS) for optimising\n\nboth conventional and electric vehicles networks. In Chapter 6, we demonstrate that, by\n\nusing simple ideas, one can design an effective SAS for electric vehicles to minimise group\n\nenergy consumption in a distributed and privacy-aware manner; Matlab simulation are give\n\nto illustrate the effectiveness of this approach. Further, we extend this idea to conventional\n\nvehicles in Chapter 7 and we show that by using some of the ideas introduced in Chapter\n\n6, group emissions of conventional vehicles can also be minimised under the same SAS\n\nframework. SUMO simulation and Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) tests involving real vehicles\n\nare given to illustrate user acceptability and ease of deployment.\n\nFinally, note that many applications in this thesis are based on the theories of a class\n\nof nonlinear iterative feedback systems. For completeness, we present a rigorous proof on\n\nglobal convergence of consensus of such systems in Chapter 2",

It alsohighlights the research objectives and contributions of the work.1.1 IntroductionThis thesis is motivated by problems that arise due to the deployment of Electric Vehicles(EVs) and the construction of the smart grid and smart transportation systems. To com-mence the thesis, we give a short background on some of the issues that arise due to thesedevelopments. This thesis is organised in four parts:\u2022 Part I: A Consensus Algorithm with Feedback.\u2022 Part II: Grid Integration with EVs.\u2022 Part III: Optimal Energy Management Strategies in Smart Grid.\u2022 Part IV: Distributed and Privacy-Aware Speed Advisory Systems.In Part I, we describe a privacy-preserving consensus algorithm that we shall use through-out the thesis. In Part II, we describe several problems that arise when EVs integrate withgrids. In Part III, we describe issues arising from microgrids. Finally we describe in Part IV,mobility related ideas for EV efficiency.1.1 Introduction 21.1.1 A Consensus Algorithm with FeedbackLiterally, convergence to a common value is called the consensus or agreement problem [162].Consensus problems have been studied for a long time in the field of computer science [145].These problems are particularly of interest in the communities of control theory, distributedcomputation and optimisation [122, 136, 162], which usually require a target system couldbe operated at some consensus conditions. In recent years, a variety of consensus algorithmshave been developed in a large volume of literature for cooperative control of multi-agentsystems, see for instance, [135, 136, 139, 144, 162, 214]. At the heart of the algorithm designis to achieve agreement (consensus) on the states of the agents in a multi-agent system byusing local (neighbour-to-neighbour) information exchange [160, 161]. Information flowin a system is usually considered under the assumptions of time-varying communicationtopologies to model the practical disturbance and uncertainty (e.g. delays and link failures)imposed on the deployed communication networks in the process of information exchangeamong agents [103, 195, 214]. For achieving consensus, each agent is usually required toupdate its own states in an iterative fashion based on other information received from itsneighbours. Eventually, it is expected that these algorithms could drive the states of theagents to the consensus conditions in this manner. This idea can also be extended to dealwith other consensus problems by adding a global feedback signal as a common input to allagents. Under this circumstance, the states of the agents can be designed to converge to amore desired consensus value as a function of the global feedback signal. Thus, a globalobjective can be considered while the consensus of the states of agents are still maintained.In the thesis, we call such algorithm a consensus algorithm with feedback.Most recently, many consensus algorithms with feedback have been applied to solveproblems in the context of smart grid and smart transportation systems. In smart grids, dis-tributed consensus algorithms could be used to automatically distribute the power generationtask among Distributed Generators (DGs), where the consensus variable could be chosen asthe amount of power need to be generated by each DG. The consensus algorithm is used todrive the power dispatched by each DG to the same value (fairness) and the feedback signalis used to match the total power generation from DGs with the demand required. In addition,consensus algorithms can also be adopted for solving optimisation problems by choosingdifferent variables for consensus. For instance, in [220] a consensus algorithm is appliedto solve optimal economical dispatch problem in a smart grid. The philosophy behind thealgorithm is to equalise the incremental cost of each generator such that the optimisationcriterion is satisfied (i.e. the total generation cost of all power generators is minimised) andthe feedback signal is chosen to make the demand constraint. Similar ideas have also beenapplied to solve the smart transportation related problems, especially from the perspective1.1 Introduction 3of environmental benefits [94, 167]. It has been shown in [94] that by using the proposedconsensus algorithm, a fleet of hybrid vehicles could be cooperated to regulate CO2 emissionsto a given level while maximising their overall driving range, where the fairness (consensus)of the algorithm refers to the emission target allocated to each vehicle must be equalised.Compared to conventional centralised based solutions, which usually depend on manyglobal information for coordination, consensus based distributed optimisation algorithms aremore attractive as they only require local info exchange among agents and limited globalinformation as a feedback signal. Under the appropriate setup, they can also easily handletime-varying communication topologies and reserve the privacy of each agent. In this spirit,many of the algorithms we shall discuss in the thesis (i.e., Chapters 4, 6 and 7) are based ona fundamental distributed consensus theory from the cooperative control literature [95].In particular, we shall consider the following nonlinear system studied in [95]:x(k +1) = P(k)x(k)+ \u00b5(r \u2212g(x(k)))e (1.1)where x(k) \u2208 Rn, P(k) is a n\u00d7 n row stochastic matrix, e = [1 1 . . . 1]T , \u00b5 and r are scalarswhile g is a scalar valued function. Equation (1.1) describes a consensus problem subjectto an output constraint. It basically says that if consensus is achieved, it must be achievedsubject to the equilibrium constraint g(x\u2217) = r . That is, at equilibriumg(x\u2217) = r, (1.2)with x\u2217i = x\u2217j for all i, j \u2208 {1,2, ...,n}.Known from [162] that a row stochastic matrix P operates on a vector x \u2208 Rn such thatmax(x)\u2212min(x) \u2265 max(Px)\u2212min(Px) (1.3)where max(x) and min(x) are defined as the maximum and minimum component in vectorx, respectively. Since the addition of(r \u2212g(x(k)))e does not affect this contraction, intuitionsuggests that xi (k)\u2212 x j (k) \u2192 0 as k increases and eventually, the dynamics of (1.1) will begoverned by the following scalar Lure system:y(k +1) = y(k)+ \u00b5(r\u2212g(y(k)e)), (1.4)with xi (k) \u2248 y(k) asymptotically for all i. Intuition further suggests, as long as (1.4) is stable,then so is (1.1). A plausibility argument along these lines, in support of (1.1), is given in [95].However, no formal stability proof is given in that paper. This is the first problem that weshall mainly discuss in the thesis.1.1 Introduction 41.1.2 Grid Integration with EVsIn recent years, with government policies incentivising sustainable society developments, andrapid technological advances by the automotive industry, electric vehicles are increasinglybeing prioritised as a means of reducing pollution, combating climate change and improvingenergy security. Many countries have set ambitious target for EV penetration. The IrishGovernment, for example, has set a target of 10% for penetration of EVs in Ireland by 2020[54]. China is targeting 20% - 30% EV penetration by 2030.Electric vehicles can generally be classified as being either battery electric, battery andcombustion engine hybrids or fuel cell based [118]. Among these, Battery Electric Vehicles(BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) can recharge the batteries from theexternal power grid and are collectively referred to as Plug-in EVs (PEVs). PHEVs havebecome a very popular topic for research and development since 2007 due to their potentialto overcome the range anxiety adoption barrier associated with BEVs [171]. However, asbattery capacities continue to grow BEVs are also likely to be widely adopted [89, 90].From a power system perspective a major concern is that, as EV penetration increases,the extra demand due to EV charging will have a considerable impact on the design andoperation of electrical power systems [119]. In [50, 60, 125, 156, 172, 200] it has been shownthat the widespread adoption of EVs could negatively impact the distribution network ifcharging is not properly coordinated. Grid impacts of uncoordinated charging include, but arenot limited to, increased voltage imbalance [156], increased grid losses [200], overloading[172], fluctuation of grid frequencies [199], and increased harmonic distortion [97]. In turnthese effects result in a decrease in the operational efficiency of the grid and in the lifespan of electrical devices. It is also observed in these studies that in order to accommodatethe extra EV charging loads it will be necessary for utilities to invest in and reinforce gridinfrastructures in heavily loaded areas to accommodate both EV and household loads. Hence,it becomes important to develop modern smart grid infrastructure and flexible charging anddischarging strategies to mitigate the impact of the role out of EVs on the grid [157, 163, 184].To date, there have been many research studies focused on designing a variety of EVcharging algorithms for different purposes. However, it is also shown that not every proposedsolution in literature considers real grid constraints, e.g., [48, 192]. As a consequence, thesealgorithms are mostly helpful for modelling and theoretical analysis of the EV chargingprocess, but not suitable for practical implementation. This is the second problem we shallconsider in the thesis. In addition, it is observed that different charging algorithms are usuallyevaluated in its individual framework. However, this brings challenges for comparing theperformance of different algorithms in a common framework, which is normally desirableto identify the characteristics of each approach for purposes of comprehensive assessment.1.1 Introduction 5This is the third problem that we shall discuss in the thesis. Finally, it should be notedthat although many existing works have evaluated the performance of algorithms througha variety of simulation studies, there are a few testbeds available for physically testing thecharging algorithms, especially for those distributed algorithms that we shall discuss in thethesis. An interesting work in this direction can be seen in [13]. In this work, the circuitdesign for evaluation of the algorithms was based on a dedicated printed circuit board, whichis usually time-consuming to design. Thus, a simple circuit design is more desirable for ourpurposes.Another concern of the grid, due to an increasing number of EVs charging on the grid, isthe load balancing issue. This issue would occur dramatically when there are uneven numbersof EVs charging on different phases in a three-phase power network. It has been shownthat unbalanced power consumption on the grid can lead to challenges for grid operations,e.g., overheating of devices and increased power losses [66, 98]. At this stage, it shouldbe remarked that many conventional methods, which include applying advanced powerelectronics devices and controllers, e.g., Static Synchronous Compensators (STATCOMS)[79, 181], and the Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) [69, 185], have been deployedto solve this issue. However, these existing methods represent an increasing expense forutilities as they seek to maintain or update supporting infrastructure in low power qualityareas. In the meanwhile, there is a huge body of work, e.g., [17, 68, 86, 92, 183, 201], onusing Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technologies on EVs to provide ancillary service to the grid.This technology is attractive since EVs in this context are regarded as a set of large andflexible batteries to support the power grid when needed. Clearly, this provides opportunitiesfor developing charging/discharging methods for EVs to improve power quality (especiallyat critical times) as well. Thus, how to design the proper EV charging/discharging methodfor this purpose becomes the fourth problem that we shall discuss in the thesis.In spirit of V2G, energy can be stored when the grid produces excess energy, and canbe delivered back to the grid in times of need. EV owners see in this process the possibilityof earning money by selling the V2G service to the grid when the EV is not needed. Also,this service can be provided without inconvenience for the owners, as they simply needEVs plugged into the grid constantly, even if it is fully charged. At the same time, utilitycompanies see in this process the opportunity to actively use this service to regulate powerdispatch of generators in an efficient, economical, and environmentally-friendly manner.In fact, in a forthcoming scenario when a large share of energy will be provided fromrenewable sources, it will be possible to use ideas of V2G to mitigate the fluctuations ofrenewable energy by storing energy to EVs when it is in excess, and by recovering energyfrom the EVs when the renewable power generation is not enough to match the power load.1.1 Introduction 6Note that nowadays most of the support for renewable energy is performed by switchingon conventional power plant that are more expensive than solar/wind plant (as there aresome fuel and carbon costs to be paid), and also less environmentally friendly in terms ofproduced CO2, NOx or other pollutants\u2019 emissions. In this context, note that some countriesare already characterised by a high penetration level of energy produced from renewables,see for instance the case of Denmark, where wind plants alone provided more than 30% ofthe electricity production in 2012, and are planned to supply 50% of the overall demand bythe year 2020 [123]. Also Denmark is currently trying to become a system based only onrenewable energy by 2050 [127]. Recent works on V2G practices can be found in references[1, 70, 76, 153]. A recent work on the same topic [191] provides an overview of the optimalitycriteria that should be considered when planning V2G functionalities. In particular, it showsthat V2G functionalities should be planned in a smart fashion, as taking electricity fromvehicles in an indiscriminate fashion, could sometimes give rise to an environmental costthat might even exceed the environmental gain of using power generated from renewables(e.g., if the consequence of V2G services is that the EV owner has to take a polluting InternalCombustion Engine Vehicle (ICEV) because his/her EV no longer has sufficient energy forthe next trip). This is the fifth problem that we shall tackle in the thesis.1.1.3 Optimal Energy Management Strategies in Smart GridIn many countries around the world, current conventional power systems are facing the prob-lems of gradual depletion of fossil fuel resources, lower energy efficiency and environmentalissues [29, 42, 124]. However, the emerging smart grid envisions enhancing the existingpower system by integrating advanced sensor, communication and coordination devices intothe grid [217] with a view to enhancing its performance.An important objective of the smart grid is to perfectly balance supply and demand in thepower network [5, 55, 138], and achieving such an objective with a high level of reliabilitywhen a large share of power is generated from renewable fluctuating resources is one of thecurrent challenges in the power community. The main challenges in realising this aspirationarises because the power network is very large scale, and each node of the network shouldsense in real-time its required energy demand, and then try to balance this demand with theamount of produced energy [132]. Clearly, not only the generated power from renewablesources is stochastic, but the demand is also uncertain as it depends on the end-users\u2019 usageof electric appliances. Energy usage is also further affected by highly unpredictable factors,such as energy price, weather conditions (use of air conditioning/heating), and possibly alsoby an increasing penetration of electric transportation [193]. Thus, due to the large number1.1 Introduction 7Fig. 1.1 A Virtual Power Plant (VPP) is generally characterised by Distributed EnergyResources (DERs), including Combined Heat and Power (CHP) and wind/solar plants,storage systems, controllable and uncontrollable loads, Electric Vehicles (EVs), and isconnected to other VPPs through the grid.of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and (aggregates of) end-users, the real-time powerscheduling and balancing problem is currently an important and challenging area of research.Recently, Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) are becoming viewed as a viable answer to theaforementioned scale and distributed nature of the power system network [9]. A VirtualPower Plant is defined as \u201ca cluster of dispersed generator units, controllable loads andstorage systems, aggregated in order to operate as a unique power plant\u201d [117]. The termvirtual refers to the fact that the VPP will be, in general, a multi-fuel, multi-location, andmulti-owned power station. From a grid operator\u2019s perspective, purchasing energy or ancillaryservices from a virtual power plant is equivalent to purchasing from a conventional station[138]. The idea of a VPP is illustrated in Figure 1.1.Microgrids share similar features with VPPs, but usually the term VPP is used to empha-sise the economic features of the structure, i.e., the ability to compete in the energy marketagainst other VPPs. In addition, microgrids must be able to operate in a grid-connected mode,isolated mode, and in a transition between grid-connected and isolated modes [130]. Oneof the main advantages of microgrids and VPPs is that the energy demand will be primarilysatisfied by the DERs belonging to the same cluster of users, thus generally avoiding longdistance transport of energy and satisfying the small-distance producer-consumer paradigm[49].1.1 Introduction 8In practice VPPs decompose the original complex fully centralised network into a numberof distributed units, each one with its own central entity, called an Energy ManagementSystem (EMS), that performs the balancing task. Every time balancing is not achieved (e.g.,the power generated within a VPP, plus that stored in available storage systems is not enoughto fulfil the end-users\u2019 requirements), then the VPP buys energy from other VPPs, or fromthe smart grid in general, or can curtail some controllable loads (e.g., Direct Load Control,see [6]). Similarly, if more energy than required is produced, then the VPP tries to sellenergy to other VPPs. The main task of the EMS is to achieve the aforementioned balance ofproduced/consumed energy. Although the size of a microgrid is much smaller than that ofthe whole smart grid, there is still the major problem of selecting which power generators touse, and in which proportion, to provide the required power. This management task is thesixth problem that we shall consider in the thesis, bearing in mind that DERs within the sameVPP or microgrid do not compete among themselves to increase their earnings, as overallthey constitute a single unique (virtual) power plant. In fact, the DERs cooperate to achieve acommon goal, e.g., minimise the sum of the financial costs incurred by each DER to generateits share of power.1.1.4 Distributed and Privacy-Aware Speed Advisory SystemsVehicles have become the main mode of transport (even for short distances) in the world.Recently, they have turned into products with a high sophistication level in the currentcommercial market hand-in-hand with technological advancements, ranging from electricbikes made of smart/modern materials, provided with specialised gearing, powerful enginesand advanced localisation/tracking systems, up to magnetic-levitation trains with speedrecords for terrestrial transportation. In spite of this, vehicular systems suffer from criticalissues such as congestion management, safety concerns and control of pollutant emissions,among others.In recent years, a wide variety of applications have been proposed to address these prob-lems by adopting advanced communication, sensing and control technologies in VehicularAd-hoc Networks (VANETs) such as Vehicle-to-vehicle/infrastructure (V2X) communicationsystems, advanced on-board computing capabilities, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID),and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) [73, 143, 168]. These technologies can beused as an ancillary service providing various kinds of services to users in the framework ofIntelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), concerning safety, commercial, or even entertain-ment purposes [61]. In some specific situations, they can be used to provide precise onlineroad traffic information to drivers and therefore affect their driving behaviours to reducecongestion and avoid accidents [216].1.2 Research Objectives and Contributions 9A Speed Advisory System (SAS) can be regarded as a specific application of ADAS inVANETs. They are designed such that the drivers will \u201cknow\u201d the speed limits on the roadand thus suggest the proper speed to drivers to achieve various kinds of traffic objectives,such as enhancing driving safety [25]. However, to date little work has been done concerningthe design of the SAS for vehicles networks (e.g., conventional vehicles and EVs), takingaccount of environmental and energy efficiency objectives from an optimisation perspective.This design task for both EVs and conventional vehicles is the last problem that we shalltackle in the thesis. In addition, the SAS should be designed to in a smart fashion to preservethe privacy of vehicle drivers. By privacy-preserving we mean that the states of agents maybe revealed to other agents but other important information cannot be communicated directlyto other agents (e.g. some drivers may not wish to reveal their fuel consumption informationto other vehicles if sharing of information is a necessary procedure as required by such aSAS). Thus, how to design a SAS for optimising conventional and electric vehicles networksto achieve the aforementioned objectives in a distributed, flexible, and privacy-preservingmanner becomes the last problem we shall deal with in the thesis.1.2 Research Objectives and ContributionsPart I: A Consensus Algorithm with FeedbackWe consider the nonlinear system described by (1.1). The research objective is to establishconditions on the function g for which global uniform asymptotic stability is assured, therebygiving a rigorous proof of convergence in the process. The general setup we study can beformulated as a special case of the systems studied in [121]. In this reference the authorsprove local synchronisation results for a general class of nonlinear time-varying systems. Incontrast to the assumptions of that paper we require fewer differentiability assumptions andstate conditions which ensure global convergence.The contribution of this part is to present a rigorous proof for the stability and convergenceproperties of system (1.1). This work is presented in Chapter 2 and the original paper hasbeen submitted in [115].Part II: Grid Integration with EVsThe research on this topic can be divided into two sections according to whether EVs areconsidered with or without V2G capabilities. In the first section, we consider a variety ofG2V EV charging problems, and in the second section we propose two specific schemes forV2G implementations.1.2 Research Objectives and Contributions 10The objective in the first section is to present a common framework such that the perfor-mance of a wide variety of EV charging algorithms can be compared. In particular, we shallprovide a comparative evaluation of a range of EV charging strategies within this frameworkusing a realistic power system simulation testbed in Low-Voltage (LV) distribution networksand representative charging scenarios. Through this comparison, we aim at identifying thepositive and negative characteristics of each EV charging approach and giving an overallassessment for implementing these approaches in practice. The contributions in the firstsection are listed as follows:\u2022 A comprehensive literature review of EV charging strategies is presented from theperspective of the different actors in the power system.\u2022 A common optimisation framework incorporating real grid constraints is presented.Several typical EV charging strategies, classified as either centralised and decentralised,and providing continuous or on-off based charging, are evaluated within the proposedoptimisation framework on a distribution network using a dedicated power systemsimulation platform.\u2022 A distributed wireless testbed for charging mobile phone batteries is demonstrated as aproxy for EVs.The above works are presented in Chapter 3 and the original papers were published in[107, 108, 110, 114].The objective in the second section is to harness the power of V2G technologies toprovide flexible ancillary services to the grid. To illustrate these ideas, two specific V2Gapplications are designed in different scenarios.In the first application, we apply V2G technologies on a group of EVs to alleviate currentimbalance in a typical three-phase distribution network. In this application, we propose adistributed EV charging strategy to balance currents along the individual phases. To the bestof our knowledge, this is the first time that a distributed control algorithm has been usedto manage current imbalance issues via controlled EV charging. This work is presented inChapter 4 and the original paper was published in [111].In the second application, we model the V2G problem as an optimisation problem in theframework of microgrids with Distributed Generators (DGs). We aim to find the optimaltrade-off between the economic convenience of using energy from renewables instead ofenergy from other more expensive power plants, and the inconvenience caused to the ownerin terms of residual energy remaining in the EV. Also, we are interested in computing a1.2 Research Objectives and Contributions 11\u201cfair\u201d solution, where fairness is related to the fact that the same amount of energy should betaken from all EVs participating in the V2G programme (i.e. some EV owners might decidenot to participate in such a programme to preserve the level of energy in their EVs). Thecontribution of this work is to apply an optimal decentralised consensus algorithm that solvesthe V2G problem in a fair manner, trying to achieve an optimal trade-off between powergeneration costs and inconvenience to the vehicle owner. This work is presented in Chapter 4and the original paper was published in [105].Part III: Optimal Energy Management Strategies in Smart GridIn this topic, we consider the optimal energy management problem in a microgrid scenariowith DGs. As stated previously, the main task of the EMS in a microgrid is to achieve balanceof produced/consumed energy and to cooperate with DGs for efficient and economical powergeneration.The objective of this topic is to design an algorithm that automatically shares the powergeneration task among the available DERs in a way that is fair and distributed. As we shallsee later, the concept of fairness in this context will be with respect to a utility function,where utility will refer to financial costs for power generation. We shall achieve this objec-tive by adopting Additive-Increase-Multiplicative-Decrease (AIMD) algorithms [28]. Thecontributions of this work are summarised as follows:\u2022 A truly distributed solution is demonstrated for the power generation problem.\u2022 A consensus-like modification of the conventional synchronised AIMD algorithm ispresented to solve the utility minimisation problem for specific cost functions.\u2022 The results are illustrated in a realistic power system simulation framework.This work is presented in Chapter 5 and the original papers were published in [35, 106].Part IV: Distributed and Privacy-Aware Speed Advisory SystemsIn this topic, we consider the design of a Speed Advisory System (SAS), making useof Vehicle-to-vehicle/infrastructure (V2X) technologies, for optimising both electric andconventional vehicles networks in an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) scenario.The objective of this topic is to develop a SAS which allows groups of vehicles tocollaborate in order to find the optimal speed at which the group should travel. We shallassume that vehicles can exchange information with their neighbours and can exchangelimited information with the infrastructure via their equipped V2X technologies. We shall1.3 Thesis Outline 12show that one can design, using very simple ideas, an effective SAS, which can be used tominimise energy consumption of electric vehicles and emission generation of conventionalvehicles, in a distributed manner that preserves the privacy of individual vehicles. Thecontributions on this topic are listed as follows:\u2022 A consensus based distributed speed advisory system is proposed that optimallydetermines a recommended common speed for a given area in order that the groupbattery consumptions of EVs are minimised. The proposed algorithms achieve this in aprivacy-aware manner; namely, individual vehicles do not reveal in-vehicle informationto other vehicles or to infrastructure. Matlab simulations are given to illustrate theeffectiveness of the proposed approach. This work is presented in Chapter 6 and theoriginal papers were submitted in [112, 113].\u2022 Some of the ideas from Chapter 6 are extended to minimise the group emissions ofconventional vehicles. SUMO simulations are given to illustrate the efficacy of thealgorithm, and Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) tests involving real vehicles are givento illustrate user acceptability and ease of the deployment. This work is presented inChapter 7 and the original papers were submitted in [112, 113].1.3 Thesis OutlineThe rest of the thesis is organised as follows:\u2022 Chapter 2 gives a rigorous proof for the stability and convergence properties of arecently proposed consensus algorithm with output constraint.\u2022 Chapter 3 presents a comprehensive review of recent works on a variety of EV charg-ing strategies. We model different EV charging problems in a common mathematicalframework and describe different EV charging scenarios as optimisation problemshaving either temporal or instantaneous objectives with respect to different powersystem stakeholders. To compare the performances of these approaches, typical fair-ness and temporal based EV charging strategies are introduced and evaluated on adedicated power system simulation platform. A few modifications to the algorithmsare introduced to enhance the grid performance for algorithm implementations. Finally,detailed design procedures for an AIMD based battery charging testbed (hardware) aredemonstrated.\u2022 Chapter 4 focuses on investigating different V2G schemes as an ancillary serviceto support the grid. Two V2G schemes are presented. The first scheme considers a1.3 Thesis Outline 13current imbalance problem in a distribution network. The second scheme discussesthe optimal power dispatch of EVs in a microgrid scenario with fluctuating renewableenergy generation.\u2022 Chapter 5 proposes an AIMD-like distributed approach to optimally share the powergeneration tasks for DERs in a microgrid scenario. The performance of the proposedapproach is evaluated and compared to a centralised solution to show its effectiveness.As an extension, this solution is further modified to incorporate thermal constraints fordouble power balancing requirements.\u2022 Chapter 6 demonstrates a new design for a SAS, using ideas from Chapter 2, tooptimise energy efficiencies for a group of EVs in a city centre scenario. Matlabsimulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.\u2022 Chapter 7 extends the works in Chapter 6 and applies some of the ideas of the SASto minimising pollutant generation of conventional vehicles in an highway scenario.A variety of simulation studies are given, e.g., SUMO simulations and HIL tests, toevaluate the performance of the proposed system.\u2022 Chapter 8 concludes the thesis and discusses future research directions.Part IA Consensus Algorithm with FeedbackChapter 2Stability and Convergence AnalysisAbstract: In this chapter, we discuss the stability and convergence of a recently proposedconsensus algorithm with output constraints. It is joint work with Fabian Wirth, MartinCorless and Robert Shorten and has been submitted to the IEEE Transactions on AutomaticControl [115]. The algorithm is further extended for applications in Chapters 4, 6 and 7.2.1 IntroductionWe consider nonlinear systems described byx(k +1) = P(k)x(k)+ \u00b5(r \u2212g(x(k)))e (2.1)where x(k) \u2208 Rn, P(k) is a n\u00d7 n row stochastic matrix, e = [1 1 . . . 1]T , \u00b5 and r are scalarswhile g is a scalar valued function. Equation (2.1) describes a consensus problem subjectto an output constraint. It basically says that if consensus is achieved, it must be achievedsubject to the equilibrium constraint g(x\u2217) = r . That is, at equilibriumg(x\u2217) = r, (2.2)with x\u2217i = x\u2217j for all i, j \u2208 {1,2, ...,n}.Equation (2.1) is of interest as it arises in many situations in the study of the Internet ofThings (IOT). For example, in some situations a group of agents are asked to achieve a fairallocation of a constrained resource r (e.g. bandwidth), and hence xi (k) can be modelledas the amount of resources allocated to the agent i at time k, and the feedback functiong(x(k)) can be regarded as the total amount of resources allocated to all agents x at time k,which is expected to approach to r over time. TCP is an algorithm that strives to achieve2.1 Introduction 16this objective in internet congestion control. Recently, similar ideas have been applied inthe context of charging of electric vehicles, smart grid applications, and in the regulation ofpollution in an urban context [105, 167, 189]. In the context of EVs, a distributed consensusalgorithm of the form of (2.1) has been developed in [105] to provide an optimal fairnesssolution for the V2G scheme. The fairness of the solution refers to the discharge rates ofEVs will achieve consensus when algorithm converges (i.e. x\u2217i = x\u2217j for all i, j \u2208 {1,2, ...,n})and the function g(x) was specifically designed such that the optimality of the algorithmachieves when g(x\u2217) = r . In the context of smart grids, power plants can be easily operated,by using such algorithms, to provide a fair generation of power while maintaining the overallemissions of all plants to a certain level. In this model, the power generation of each plant atgiven time instance k can be modelled as xi (k) and g(x(k)) can be modelled as the overallemissions polluted by generating x(k) amount of power from all plants, where r can referto a daily emission target that cannot be exceeded. A second application arises when onewishes to optimise an objective function subject to certain privacy constraints. For example,collaborative cruise control systems are emerging in which a group of vehicles on a stretch ofroad share information to determine an advised speed limit that minimises fuel consumptionof the swarm subject to some constraint (traffic flow, pollution constraints) [67]. Since eachcar is individually optimised for a potentially different speed, the technical challenge is forthe group of cars to agree on a common speed without an individual revealing any of its innerworkings to other vehicles.Another example in this direction arises in the context of deploying services from parkedcars as part of an IBM Research project. Here, privacy preserving algorithms of the formof (2.1) have been deployed and demonstrated to show great promise in the context of loadbalancing across batteries from a fleet of parked vehicles [175]. Other examples of this natureabound. For example, in many applications a number of sensing devices are asked to agreeon a common value (a consensus problem). Each device is subject to some sensing error.The objective is then to find the common value that is most likely; namely, minimises somegroup-wide uncertainty without the individual uncertainty functions being revealed to otheragents.The proliferation of such applications is a direct consequence of large scale connectivityof both devices and people. This connectivity has given rise to a new wave of researchfocussed on addressing societal inefficiencies in a manner that has hitherto been impossible[31, 156]. At the heart of these engineering applications is the idea that individual things(agents) orchestrate their behaviour to achieve a common goal. Typically, these problemshave a common property in that one tries either implicitly or explicitly to solve a consensusproblem with an input. As we have mentioned, for reasons of privacy, usually one does2.2 Notation, Conventions and Preliminary Results 17not attempt to solve such problems in a fully distributed manner. Neither, for reasonsof robustness, scale, and communication overhead, does one attempt to solve them in acentralised manner. Rather, one uses a mix of local communication, and limited broadcastinformation, to solve these problems in a manner that conceals the private information ofeach of the individual agents. Implicit and explicit consensus algorithms that exploit localand global communication strategies are proposed and studied in [95]. Equation (2.1) isperhaps the simplest algorithm of the explicit consensus algorithm with inputs, admitting avery simple intuitive understanding, which can be explained as follows. It is easily knownfrom [162] that a row stochastic matrix P operates on a vector x \u2208 Rn such thatmax(x)\u2212min(x) \u2265 max(Px)\u2212min(Px) (2.3)where max(x) and min(x) are defined as the maximum and minimum component in vectorx, respectively. Since the addition of(r \u2212g(x(k)))e, which is a vector with all same values,does not affect this contraction, intuition suggests that xi (k)\u2212 x j (k) \u2192 0 as k increases andeventually, the dynamics of (2.1) will be governed by the following scalar Lure system:y(k +1) = y(k)+ \u00b5(r\u2212g(y(k)e)), (2.4)with xi (k) \u2248 y(k) asymptotically for all i. Intuition further suggests, as long as (2.4) is stable,then so is (2.1). A plausibility argument along these lines, in support of (2.1), is given in [95].However, no formal stability proof is given in that paper.Our objective in this chapter is to address this and to establish conditions on the functiong for which global uniform asymptotic stability is assured, thereby giving a rigorous proof ofconvergence in the process.2.2 Notation, Conventions and Preliminary ResultsIn this section we give the notation, conventions and present some preliminary results neededto study the dynamics of the systems.1. Notation. We denote the standard basis in Rn by the vectors e1, . . ., en. Note thate =\u2211ni=1 ei. A matrix P \u2208 Rn\u00d7n is called row stochastic if all its entries are nonnegative and ifall its row sums equal one. The row sum condition is equivalent to Pe = e, that is, e is aneigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 1. Hence there is a single transformationwhich achieves upper block triangularisation of all row stochastic matrices. Let {v2, . . .,vn} bea basis for the n\u22121 dimensional subspace e\u22a5 := {x \u2208 Rn : eT x = 0}. Then {e,v2, . . .,vn} is a2.2 Notation, Conventions and Preliminary Results 18basis of Rn. Consider now the transformation matrix T :=[e v2 . . . vn]which representsa change of basis from the standard basis to the new basis. Under this transformation, a rowstochastic matrix P is transformed as follows:T\u22121PT =\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f01 cT0 Q\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb (2.5)where c \u2208 Rn\u22121 and Q \u2208 R(n\u22121)\u00d7(n\u22121).2. Facts about consensus. Given a sequence of row stochastic matrices {P(k)}k\u2208N, considerthe time-varying linear systemx(k +1) = P(k)x(k) . (2.6)A solution of (2.6) is represented by the left products of the matrix sequence in the followingsense: a sequence {x(k)}k\u2208N is a solution of (2.6) corresponding to the initial conditionx(0) = x0 if and only if for all k \u2208 N,x(k) = \u03a6(k)x0 (2.7)where\u03a6(k) := P(k \u22121) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7P(0) , \u2200k \u2208 N . (2.8)The sequence {P(k)}k\u2208N is called weakly ergodic if the difference between each pair or rowsof \u03a6(k) converges to zero, i.e. if for all i, j we havelimk\u2192\u221e(eTj \u2212 eTi)\u03a6(k) = 0 . (2.9)This is equivalent to system (2.6) being a consensus system, that is, every solution {x(k)}k\u2208Rnof (2.6) satisfieslimk\u2192\u221ex j (k)\u2212 xi (k) = 0 (2.10)for all i, j.The sequence {P(k)}k\u2208N is strongly ergodic if it is weakly ergodic and, in addition,the limit limk\u2192\u221e\u03a6(k) exists. By a result of Chatterjee and Seneta [27] weak and strongergodicity are equivalent for left products of row stochastic matrices. This is equivalent toevery solution of (2.6) satisfyinglimk\u2192\u221ex(k) \u2208 E (2.11)2.2 Notation, Conventions and Preliminary Results 19or, equivalently,limk\u2192\u221e\u03a6(k)x0 \u2208 E (2.12)for all x0 \u2208 Rn where E := span{e} is the space of consensus vectors.We call the sequence {P(k)}k\u2208N uniformly strongly ergodic, if all tail sequences {P(k)}\u221ek=k0are strongly ergodic for all k0 \u2208 N. Note that a sequence can be strongly ergodic and notuniformly strongly ergodic. For instance, if one of the matrices in the sequence has rank 1and all the subsequent matrices are the identity matrix.Using the transformation (2.5) a system equivalent to (2.6) is given byz(k +1) = T\u22121P(k)T z(k)T\u22121P(k)T :=\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f01 c(k)T0 Q(k)\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb .(2.13)It is then clear that {P(k)} is strongly ergodic if and only iflimk\u2192\u221eQ(k) . . .Q(0) = 0 . (2.14)A useful property in the study of products of row stochastic matrices is the observationthat for any row stochastic matrix Pmin(x) \u2264 min(Px) \u2264 max(Px) \u2264 max(x) (2.15)for all x \u2208 Rn, where for any vector y \u2208 Rn,min(y) := min{y1 . . ., yn} , max(y) := max{y1 . . ., yn} .Note that details of this property can be referred from [91, 188]. As the associated differenceof maximum and minimum plays the role of a Lyapunov function we introduce the notationV (x) := max(x)\u2212min(x) . (2.16)Clearly, (2.15) implies that V (Px) \u2264 V (x). Also, the sequence {P(k)}k\u2208N is strongly ergodic,if and only iflimk\u2192\u221eV(\u03a6(k)x0)= 0 (2.17)for all x0 \u2208 Rn where \u03a6(k) is given by (2.8).2.3 Consensus under Feedback 20In this chapter the standard norm used is the Euclidean norm \u2225x\u2225 = \u221axT x. Note that anyvector x \u2208 Rn can be uniquely decomposed asx = xe+ x\u22a5wherex := (1/n)eT x (2.18)is the mean of the components of x andx\u22a5 := x\u2212 xe \u2208 e\u22a5 , (2.19)i.e. eT x\u22a5 = 0. Hencedist(x,E) = \u2225x\u22a5\u2225 (2.20)wheredist(x,E) := inf{\u2225x\u2212 z\u2225 : z \u2208 E}is the distance of a vector x \u2208 Rn to the consensus set E.Note also thatV (x) = V (x\u22a5) (2.21)and for any vector z \u2208 Rn and any row-stochastic matrix P \u2208 Rn\u00d7n we have\u2225z\u2225\u221e = max1\u2264i\u2264n|zi | and \u2225P\u2225\u221e = max1\u2264i\u2264nn\u2211j=1|Pi j | = 1where Pi j is the entry in ith row and j th column of the matrix P.2.3 Consensus under FeedbackConsider a sequence of row stochastic matrices {P(k)}k\u2208N and a continuous function G :Rn \u2192 R. Then, the system,x(k +1) = F (k, x(k))F (k, x) := P(k)x+G(x)e(2.22)can be regarded as consensus system under feedback.2.3 Consensus under Feedback 21In later statements, further differentiability assumptions will be imposed on G as required.Associated with (2.22) we consider the one-dimensional systemy(k +1) = h(y(k))h(y) := y+G(ye) .(2.23)This is the aforementioned Lure system and, as we shall see, the dynamics of the consensussystem (2.22) is strongly related to the dynamics of (2.23). Unless stated otherwise weconsider the systems (2.22) and (2.23) with initial time k0 = 0. A few comments on resultsthat hold uniformly with respect to all initial times are made where appropriate.2.3.1 Local Stability ResultsWe begin with the following elementary observations.Lemma 1 Let {P(k)}k\u2208N be a sequence of row stochastic matrices and G : Rn \u2192 R. If{y(k)}k\u2208N is a solution of (2.23) then {y(k)e}k\u2208N is a solution of (2.22).Proof: This follows from P(k)e = e.The next result tells us that the consensus system under feedback (2.22) is also a consensussystem.Lemma 2 Let {P(k)}k\u2208N be a sequence of row stochastic matrices which is strongly ergodic.Then for every solution {x(k)}k\u2208N of (2.22) we havelimk\u2192\u221edist (x(k),E) = 0 . (2.24)Proof: Consider any solution {x(k)}k\u2208N of (2.22) and let x0 = x(0). Since {P(k)}k\u2208Nis strongly ergodic, recalling from (2.17) we havelimk\u2192\u221eV (\u03a6(k)x0) = 0,where \u03a6(k) is given by (2.8). On the other hand,V (x(k +1)) = V (P(k)x(k)+G(x(k))e)= V (P(k)x(k)) .This shows by induction that for all k \u2208 N we haveV (x(k)) = V (\u03a6(k)x0) .2.3 Consensus under Feedback 22Hence,limk\u2192\u221eV (x(k)) = 0,which is equivalent tolimk\u2192\u221ex j (k)\u2212 xi (k) = 0for all i, j. This is the same as the desired result (2.24).We now consider the local stability of (2.22) and see that it is determined by the stabilityof the induced system (2.23) on the consensus space. As we have no global concerns noLipschitz property of G is required. Initially, it is sufficient that G be continuous.Theorem 3 Let {P(k)}k\u2208N be a strongly ergodic sequence of row stochastic matrices andG : Rn \u2192 R be continuous. Suppose that y\u2217 is a locally asymptotically stable fixed point ofthe one dimensional system (2.23). Then y\u2217e is a locally asymptotically stable fixed point attime k = 0 for (2.22).If the sequence {P(k)}k\u2208N is uniformly strongly ergodic, then y\u2217e is asymptotically stablefor all initial times k0 \u2208 N.Proof: Suppose that y\u2217 is a locally asymptotically stable fixed point for system (2.23).Let W be a local Lyapunov function which guarantees this stability property. That is, W (y\u2217) =0 and there is an open neighborhood U of y\u2217 such that W (y) > 0 and W (h(y)) < W (y) forall y \u2208U \\ {y\u2217}. Without loss of generality we may assume U to be a forward invariant set of(2.23). This assumption implies if y(k) \u2208U then so is h(y(k)) \u2208U at all times k \u2208 N. Definethe arithmetic mean of the entries of x \u2208 Rn byx := (1/n)eT x . (2.25)For \u03b5 > 0 such that W\u22121([0, \u03b5]) \u2282U is a compact set we may choose \u03b4 > 0 sufficiently small,so thatW (h(y)+ d) < \u03b5 for W (y) < \u03b5 and |d | \u2264 \u03b4 .This is possible by continuity of all the functions involved and by the decay property of theLyapunov function W .Now note that for any x \u2208 Rn,Px = P(xe+ x\u22a5) = xe+Px\u22a5.HencePx\u2212 x = Px\u22a5 = (1/n)eT Px\u22a5 . (2.26)2.3 Consensus under Feedback 23Given a sufficiently small \u03b5 > 0 and an appropriate \u03b4 as above, choose \u03b7 > 0 such thatV (x) \u2264 \u03b7 and W (x) \u2264 \u03b5 implies for any row stochastic matrix P that|Px\u2212 x |+ |G(x)\u2212G(xe) | < \u03b4 .This is possible by uniform continuity of G on a bounded neighborhood of y\u2217e. Roughlyspeaking, the uniform continuity of G guarantees that G(x) can be sufficiently close to G(xe)if x is sufficiently close to xe. Consider now the neighborhood of y\u2217e given byN\u03b5 := {x \u2208 Rn : x \u2208U, W (x) < \u03b5,V (x) < \u03b7} .We wish to prove the local stability of y\u2217e by showing N\u03b5 is forward invariant at all timesk \u2208 N. Indeed, if x(k) \u2208 N\u03b5, then we obtainx(k +1) = P(k)x(k)+G(x(k))= x(k)+G(x(k)e)+ d= h(x(k))+ dwhere d = P(k)x(k)\u2212 x(k)+G(x(k))\u2212G(x(k)e). Hence |d | < \u03b4 from which it follows thatW (x(k +1)) < \u03b5.Referring to the argument in the proof of Lemma 2V (x(k +1)) = V (P(k)x(k)) \u2264 V (x(k)) < \u03b7.As \u03b5,\u03b7 were arbitrary, this shows stability of y\u2217e.To show local attractivity, let x0 \u2208 N\u03b5 for \u03b5 > 0 sufficiently small so that stability holds.Note that by Lemma 2 and by stability we have that \u03c9(x0) \u2282 Ue \u2282 E where \u03c9(x0) is the\u03c9-limit set of the solution corresponding to x0. Suppose that ye \u2208 \u03c9(x0) and y , y\u2217 . Thenas the trajectory starting in ye converges to y\u2217e it follows that y\u2217e \u2208 \u03c9(x0). However, theassumption that y\u2217e and ye are in the \u03c9-limit set contradicts the stability of y\u2217e. Hence{x(k)}k\u2208N converges to y\u2217e.We now extend the previous result to local exponential stability. To this end we call asequence of row stochastic matrices {P(k)}k\u2208N exponentially ergodic if it is strongly ergodic2.3 Consensus under Feedback 24and there exist scalars M \u2265 1, 0 < r < 1 such that for all k \u2208 N\u2225\u03a6(k)\u2212\u03a6\u221e\u2225 \u2264 Mr k .The sequence is called uniformly exponentially ergodic, if it is uniformly strongly ergodicand the constants M, r can be chosen such that for all k, k0 \u2208 N with k \u2265 k0 there exists amatrix \u03a6\u221e such that \u2225\u03a6\u02dc(k, k0)\u2212\u03a6\u221e\u2225 \u2264 Mr (k\u2212k0); where\u03a6\u02dc(k, k0) := P(k \u22121) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7P(k0) .Theorem 4 Let {P(k)}k\u2208N be an exponentially ergodic sequence of row stochastic matricesand G : Rn \u2192 R be continuously differentiable. Suppose that y\u2217 is a locally exponentiallystable fixed point of the one dimensional system (2.23). Then, y\u2217e is a locally exponen-tially stable fixed point at time k = 0 for (2.22). If the sequence {P(k)}k\u2208N is uniformlyexponentially ergodic, then y\u2217e is locally uniformly exponentially stable.Proof: Consider the linearisation of the one-dimensional map defining (2.23). By theassumption of exponential stability its modulus must satisfy|h\u2032(y\u2217) | < 1 (2.27)where h\u2032(y\u2217) = 1+DG(y\u2217e)e and DG is the derivative of G, which we interpret as a rowvector. We now compute the derivative of F with respect to x at x = y\u2217e and time k to obtain\u2202F\u2202x(k, y\u2217e) = P(k)+ eDG(y\u2217e). (2.28)If we now consider the transformation T which results in (2.13) and using T\u22121e = e1 wesee thatT\u22121\u2202F\u2202x(k, y\u2217e)T =\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f01 c(k)T0 Q(k)\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb + e1DG(y\u2217e)T . (2.29)Two things are noticeable when considering this equation. First the resulting transformedmatrix is of the form \uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\u03bb c\u02dc(k)T0 Q(k)\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb , (2.30)where only the first row is affected by G and \u03bb is independent of k. Secondly,\u03bb = 1+DG(y\u2217e)e = h\u2032(y\u2217) . (2.31)2.3 Consensus under Feedback 25Hence |\u03bb | < 1. By assumption \u2225Q(k)Q(k \u22121) . . .Q(0)\u2225 \u2264 Mr k for suitable constants M \u22651,r \u2208 (0,1). It now follows that the linearised system of (2.22) at the fixed point y\u2217e isexponentially stable. It follows by standard linearisation theory, that the nonlinear systemis locally exponentially stable at y\u2217e. If the sequence Q(k)Q(k \u22121) . . .Q(0) converges tozero uniformly exponentially, this shows local uniform exponential stability of y\u2217e for thenonlinear system.2.3.2 Global Stability ResultsTo obtain global stability results we first need the following boundedness result.Lemma 5 Let {P(k)}k\u2208N be a strongly ergodic sequence of row stochastic matrices andsuppose that G : Rn \u2192 R is continuous and satisfies the following conditions.(i) There exists an \u03b5 > 0 such that G satisfies a Lipschitz condition with constant L > 0on the setB\u03b5 (E) := {x \u2208 Rn : dist(x,E) \u2264 \u03b5} .(ii) There exists constants \u03b2, \u03b3 > 0 such that|h(y) | \u2264 |y | \u2212\u03b3 when |y | \u2265 \u03b2where h(y) = y+G(ye).Then every trajectory of (2.22) is bounded.Proof: Consider any solution {x(k)}k\u2208N of (2.22) with x(0) = x0. By Lemma 2 thereexists a k0 \u2208 N such that x(k) \u2208 B\u03b5 (E) for all k \u2265 k0.We can express x(k) asx(k) = x(k)e+ x\u22a5(k)where x(k) = (1/n)eT x(k) and x\u22a5(k) := x(k)\u2212 x(k)e.It follows from (2.24) that limk\u2192\u221e \u2225x\u22a5(k)\u2225 = 0. Hence boundedness of the sequence{x(k)}k\u2208N implies boundedness of {x(k)}k\u2208N. Considering the evolution of x(k) we obtainthat, for k \u2265 k0,2.3 Consensus under Feedback 26|x(k +1) | = |P(k)x(k)+G (x(k)e+ x\u22a5(k)) |\u2264 |x(k)+G(x(k)e) |+ |P(k)x(k)\u2212 x(k) |+ |G (x(k)e+ x\u22a5(k)) \u2212G(x(k)e) |\u2264 |h(x(k)) |+ |(1/n)eT P(k)x\u22a5(k) |+ L\u2225x\u22a5(k)\u2225\u2264 |h(x(k)) |+ L\u02dc\u2225x\u22a5(k)\u2225where l := supk\u2208N(1/n)\u2225eT P(k)\u2225 and L\u02dc := l + L. Hence|x(k +1) | \u2264 |h(x(k)) |+ L\u02dc\u2225x\u22a5(k)\u2225 .It now follows from hypothesis (ii) that whenever |x(k) | \u2265 \u03b2, we must have|x(k +1) | \u2264 |x(k) | \u2212\u03b3+ L\u02dc\u2225x\u22a5(k)\u2225.Since limk\u2192\u221e \u2225x\u22a5(k)\u2225 = 0, there exists a k\u2217 \u2265 k0 such that L\u02dc\u2225x\u22a5(k)\u2225 \u2264 \u03b3 for all k > k\u2217.Thus,|x(k +1) | \u2264 |x(k) | when k \u2265 k\u2217 and |x(k) | \u2265 \u03b2.This implies boundedness of {x(k)}k\u2208N and completes the proof.Comment: As an example of a general class of functions which satisfy hypothesis (ii)of Lemma 5, consider any strict contraction mapping h on R, i.e., for a suitable constantc \u2208 (0,1),|h(x)\u2212 h(y) | \u2264 c |x\u2212 y | , \u2200x, y \u2208 R.By the Banach contraction theorem, there is a unique fixed point y\u2217 such that h(y\u2217) = y\u2217.Hence,|h(y) | \u2264 |h(y)\u2212 y\u2217 |+ |y\u2217 |\u2264 c |y\u2212 y\u2217 |+ |y\u2217 |\u2264 c |y |+ (1+ c) |y\u2217 |= |y | \u2212 (1\u2212 c) |y |+ (1+ c) |y\u2217 |and hypothesis (ii) is assured with \u03b2 = 1+c1\u2212c |y\u2217 |.Finally, we state a global result on asymptotic and exponential stability. In spirit, thefollowing two results are closely related to [121, Theorem 1]. Note that we obtain a global2.3 Consensus under Feedback 27result and are only concerned with fixed points, not general attractors. Also no assumptionon the invertibility of the Jacobian is required.Theorem 6 Let {P(k)}k\u2208N \u2282 Rn\u00d7n be a strongly ergodic sequence of row stochastic matricesand suppose that G satisfies all conditions of Lemma 5. If y\u2217 is a globally asymptoticallystable fixed point of (2.23) then, y\u2217e is a globally asymptotically stable fixed point for system(2.22).Proof: The assumptions of Theorem 3 are met and so it only remains to show globalattractivity. Note that, by Lemma 5 all solutions of (2.22) are bounded. By Lemma 2 the\u03c9-limit sets corresponding to all initial conditions lie in E. So consider an \u03c9-limit set \u03c9(x0)and assume that ye \u2208 \u03c9(x0) but y , y\u2217. Let U be a neighborhood of y\u2217e on which localstability holds according to Theorem 3. We may assume dist(ye,U) > 0. As ye \u2208 E it followsfrom Lemma 1 that all solutions x(\u00b7; k0, ye) with the initial condition x(k0) = ye satisfylimk\u2192\u221ex(k; k0, ye) = y\u2217e .Note that on E the system is time-invariant, so that there exists a time K , such that for all k0we havex(k0+K ; k0, ye) \u2208U .By assumption (i) the maps x 7\u2192 P(k)x +G(x)e are equicontinuous (i.e., each map isuniformly continuous) on B\u03b5 (E). Choose \u03b7 > 0 such thatB\u03b7,\u221e(E) := {x \u2208 Rn ; dist\u221e(x,E) = minr\u2208R \u2225x\u2212 re\u2225\u221e < \u03b7}is contained in B\u03b5 (E). The set B\u03b7,\u221e(E) is forward invariant under all F (k, \u00b7), because ifdist\u221e(x,E) = \u2225x\u2212 rxe\u2225\u221e < \u03b7, then as \u2225P\u2225\u221e = 1 for all row stochastic matricesdist\u221e(P(k)x+G(x)e,E) = dist\u221e(P(k)x,E) =minr\u2208R \u2225P(k)(x\u2212re)\u2225\u221e \u2264 \u2225P(k)(x\u2212rxe)\u2225\u221e < \u03b7 .Thus there exists a sufficiently small neighborhood U2 of ye such that for all k0 \u2208 N thesolution corresponding to the initial condition x(k0) \u2208U2 satisfies x(k0+K ; k0, x(k0)) \u2208U.But then by local stability, it follows that x(k; k0, x(k0)) \u2208U for all k \u2265 k0+K . We thus arriveat a contradiction, if ye \u2208\u03c9(x0), then there exists a sequence k\u2113\u2192\u221e so that lim x(k\u2113;0, x0) =ye. But then x(k\u2113;0, x0) \u2208 U2 for a sufficiently large \u2113 and hence x(k;0, x0) \u2208 U for allk \u2265 k\u2113 +K . Hence no subsequence of {x(k)} converges to ye. This contradiction completesthe proof.2.4 Conclusions 28The previous result can be sharpened, if we assume exponential stability of the fixed pointof (2.23). We omit the proof, which uses the same arguments as the proof of Theorem 6.Theorem 7 Let {P(k)}k\u2208N \u2282 Rn\u00d7n be a uniformly exponentially ergodic sequence of rowstochastic matrices and suppose that G : Rn \u2192 R is differentiable and satisfies conditions (i)and (ii) of Lemma 5. Then y\u2217e is globally uniformly exponentially stable for system (2.22).Proof: The proof follows with the same arguments of the proof of Theorem 6 and isomitted.2.3.3 Switched SystemsIn previous sections, we study the properties of system (2.22) given a fixed sequence of{P(k)}k\u2208N \u2282 Rn\u00d7n. In this section, we present some stability results for the system underarbitrary switching in the context of switched systems.Given a compact set of row stochastic matrices P \u2282 Rn\u00d7n, we may consider the switchedsystemx(k +1) = P(k)x(k)+G(x(k))e, (2.32)where P(k) \u2208 P. The results obtained so far have some immediate consequences for consen-sus under feedback with arbitrary switching. It is well-known that all sequences {Pk }k\u2208N \u2208 PNare strongly ergodic if and only if all sequences in PN are uniformly exponentially ergodic[121]. In this case we call P uniformly ergodic. The rate of convergence towards E is in factgiven by the projected joint spectral radius [121].With this in mind the results obtained so far have immediate consequences for switchedsystems of the form (2.32). We note one of these consequences.Corollary 8 Let P be a compact set of row stochastic matrices that is uniformly ergodicand suppose that G : Rn \u2192 R is differentiable and satisfies conditions (i) and (ii) of Lemma5. Then y\u2217e is globally uniformly exponentially stable for the switched system (2.32) underarbitrary switching.2.4 ConclusionsIn this chapter we present a rigorous proof of stability and convergence of a recently proposedconsensus system with feedback. More applications based on this system will be introducedin Chapters 4, 6 and 7.Part IIGrid Integration with EVsChapter 3EV Charging Strategies in Low-VoltageDistribution NetworksAbstract: In this chapter, we discuss a variety of EV charging strategies for achieving bothinstantaneous and temporal optimisation objectives with practical constraints in Low-Voltage(LV) distribution networks. It is joint work with Paul McNamara, Se\u00e1n McLoone, RobertShorten, Sonja St\u00fcdli, Richard Middleton and Julio Braslavsky and has been published in[107\u2013110, 114]. This chapter also presents a review of some recent EV charging literature.3.1 IntroductionFrom a power system perspective, a major concern is that, as increasing numbers of EVs pluginto low-voltage distribution networks, e.g., residential areas or Small Medium Enterprise(SME) areas, if charging is not regulated it is likely that coincident uncontrolled charging ofEVs will overload local distribution networks and substantially increase power requirements[32, 157]. Not surprisingly, therefore, developing smart grid infrastructure and EV chargingstrategies to mitigate the impact of the role out of EVs on the grid have been the focus ofconsiderable research effort in recent years [142, 156, 182].To date, several different strategies have been proposed for charging groups of EVsconnected to low-voltage distribution networks [31, 32, 50, 164]. These strategies can beclassified from the perspective of the different actors in the power system, which consist ofEV consumers, Distribution System Operators (DSOs) and Transmission System Operators(TSOs) [208].Consumer oriented algorithms typically focus on maximising the amount of charge thatcan be allocated to a customer in a given time period. It is usually desired to allocate the avail-3.1 Introduction 31able power to EVs in a fair way, providing a satisfactory Quality of Service (QoS), withoutviolating system constraints, and minimising the cost to the customer. Many algorithms havebeen proposed using a centralised framework, the aim of which is to maximise the amount ofcharge allocated to customers [163, 164]. Here, centralised implies that all the informationin the network is available to a centralised controller, which in turn processes the informationand decides the charge each EV will receive. These algorithms are based on linear program-ming techniques. While centralised coordination gives the best performance possible [88],centralised algorithms require access to global system information, which might not alwaysbe accessible to a centralised controller, and centralised algorithms sometimes need to collectprivate information from customers for decision making. They usually have a significantcommunication overhead, involve higher complexity computations and typically do not scalewell [35, 88, 126, 137]. For these reasons several decentralised strategies have been proposedrecently for EV charging [22, 48, 102, 158, 174, 182]. In decentralised charging strategiesindividual EVs are given a certain level of decision making autonomy. Often individual EVchargers send a limited amount of information to a centralised unit which in turn providessome global coordination of their decisions, to a degree determined by the algorithm in use.In this context, most recently, St\u00fcdli et al. [189] have proposed EV charging strategiesbased on Additive-Increase-Multiplicative-Decrease (AIMD) that can be implemented in adecentralised fashion to maximise power utilisation by EVs while achieving a fair allocationof power across customers under certain assumptions. Also, Fan [48] borrowed the conceptof congestion pricing in internet traffic control and introduced a Willingness To Pay (WTP)parameter to model the preference of user demand. Based on these ideas, he then developed anovel distributed framework for demand response and verified the convergence and dynamicbehaviour of his adaptive algorithm, namely Distributed Price Feedback (DPF). With thisframework in place, a novel distributed EV charging method was proposed such that eachEV user could adapt their charging rate according to their personal preferences, maximisingtheir own benefits. While it should be noted that most research studies to date, e.g. [48, 163,164, 189] assume that future charging facilities will be capable of regulating EV charge ratescontinuously, few works consider the more realistic situation of EV chargers that supportonly on-off charging functionality. Some recently proposed results on solving this problemcan be seen in [23, 167, 187, 192]. In particular, the authors [192] formulated this problemusing Markov chain theory and proposed a distributed charging algorithm to maximise theutilisation of the available power via on-off charging control. However, practical powersystem infrastructure and operating constraints were not considered.From the perspective of DSOs, charging strategies are usually designed to achieve a gridrelated objective such as the minimisation of power losses, while satisfying grid constraints,3.1 Introduction 32and providing satisfactory customer service. Several centralised coordination strategiesof this nature have been developed [1, 32, 39, 40, 142, 197, 211]. Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)techniques for grid regulation have also been proposed in the literature. For example, in[211], V2G was used for grid regulation on a daily basis and for peak reduction at timesof high demand. Some decentralised optimisation approaches have also been proposed toenhance grid regulation [189, 210].Charging strategies aligned to TSO priorities include those focused on the scheduling ofpower supplies in an economic way, and those seeking to maximise the use of renewables onthe grid. Centralised TSO based charging strategies include [219], where serial quadraticprogramming techniques were used to minimise the variance in the U.K. national demandprofile, and [128] which examined the use of quadratic programming for load flatteningunder different penetrations of EVs. A more general study of adapting different centralisedoptimisation strategies for the coordination of EVs from the perspective of TSOs is presentedin [81]. Several decentralised approaches developed from the TSO perspective are given in[3, 21]. In [8, 83, 100, 120] EVs are used for storage and control in order to maximise theutilisation of renewable energy. In [8], Mixed-Integer-Linear-Programming (MILP) was usedto schedule EV charging loads in order to reduce charging costs and carbon emissions. Inaddition to this, EVs have been used to provide ancillary services, such as frequency control[57, 213].With such a wide variety of algorithms available for EV charging it is desirable to havea common framework under which their performance can be compared. The objective ofthis chapter is to present such a framework for charging EVs in low-voltage distributionnetworks, and to consider the aforementioned works by providing a comparative evaluation ofa range of EV charging strategies within this framework using a realistic distribution networksimulation testbed and representative charging scenarios in both residential and SME areas.To do this, we review the basic mechanisms for several fairness based EV charging strategies,namely AIMD, DPF and on-off based charging. We propose a number of enhancements tothese algorithms that take account of the power system structure, mitigate the impact of EVson the grid from the perspective of transformer loading levels and voltage profiles, and reducepeak power requirements by responding to time-of-day pricing. Further, we also investigateother charging scenarios to provide a comparative evaluation of charging strategies froma different perspective rather than fairness. In particular, we consider those EV chargingstrategies focused on cost minimisation and valley-filling. Using an custom OpenDSS-Matlabsimulation platform, different implementations of the algorithms are evaluated for a typicallow-voltage feeder network with 50% EV penetration. With these results, we compareall considered charging strategies according to their different characteristics. Through3.2 Problem Formulation 33this comparison the positive and negative characteristics of each approach are identified.Additionally, we present a hardware design for a wireless AIMD based battery chargingtestbed to physically illustrate the ease of deployment of the decentralised algorithms. Finally,we conclude the chapter by providing suggestions for applying each charging strategy inpractice.The remainder of the chapter is organised as follows: In Section 3.2, we formulate the EVcharging problems. Section 3.3 reviews the mechanisms of uncontrolled charging, AIMD,and DPF algorithms, and also provided a brief introduction to the ideal centralised solution.In the same section, we also introduce the distributed (on-off) and the centralised (on-off)charging algorithms [164]. The enhancements to all algorithms are presented in Section3.4. In Section 3.5, two valley-filling based charging strategies are introduced. In Section3.6, we present two cost minimisation based charging strategies. In Section 3.7, we setthe simulation platform and evaluate the performance of different continuous EV chargingstrategies1 in a residential charging scenario. In Section 3.8 we implement the on-off basedEV charging strategies in a SME charging scenario. In Section 3.9, we discuss our results.Section 3.10 describes our hardware testbed designs. Finally, we give an overall assessmentof each introduced approach and conclude the chapter in Section 3.11.3.2 Problem Formulation3.2.1 NotationA scenario in which a number of houses incorporating EVs are connected to a powerdistribution network is shown in Figure 3.1. In this network, S is defined as the number ofdistribution transformers connected to the Medium-Voltage (MV) substation bus, SubBus.The SubBus is powered by a large rating transformer called T R(0), which connects to anexternal bulk power system. Let S0 denote the set {0,1, ..., S} for indexing all transformers.A number of simplifications are used in the system model. The load power consumptionin the network is discretised into M discrete time slots, each of length \u2206T . For indexingpurposes, let M denote the set {1,2, ...,M }. The loads are classified as non-EV loads, andEV loads, in the low-voltage areas. The number of houses across all low-voltage areas isgiven by N . Each EV charger is connected to a standard household outlet which is regardedas an EV charge point and each house can only have a maximum of one EV connected forcharging. Let N denote the set {1,2, ...,N } for houses and all EV charge points. The index set1The definition of \u2018continuous\u2019 and \u2018on-off\u2019 based EV charging strategies will be given in Section 3.3.3.2 Problem Formulation 34Fig. 3.1 Schematic diagram of the distribution networkof all houses connected to the transformer T R(r) is given by \u03a6rh, and similarly the index setof all EVs connected to the transformer T R(r) is given by \u03a6rc.The non-EV power consumption for the j th house at time slot k is given by h j (k), andci (k) denotes the charge rate of the ith active EV charge point at time k, for all k \u2208 M. Theelectricity price signal at time slot k, denoted E(k), represents the Time-Of-Use (TOU)[169] or real-time pricing. The corresponding electricity price signal vector is given byET := [E(1),E(2), ...,E(M)]. The charge rate vector for all EV charge points is given byc(k)T := [c1(k),c2(k), ...,cN (k)] for all k \u2208 M. The charge rate profile for the ith EV isspecified by cTi := [ci (1),ci (2), ...,ci (M)]. A charge rate matrix is also defined as C :=[c(1),c(2), ...,c(M)]. The plug-in time and plug-out time of the ith EV are given by \u03c4iin and\u03c4iout, respectively. Therefore, the ith EV must be charged within[\u03c4iin, \u03c4iout]. Let Pav(k) denotethe maximum available power that can be drawn from the external grid at time slot k. LetPevav (k) denote the maximum available power that can be provided for EV charging. Thus,Pevav (k) = min(N\u2211i=1cimax, Pav(k)\u2212N\u2211j=1h j (k)). (3.1)3.2 Problem Formulation 35Due to the battery specification, each EV may have a different battery size (kWh), andthis parameter is denoted as Bi for the ith vehicle. The State-of-Charge (SOC) for the ith EVat time k, SOCi (k), within[\u03c4iin, \u03c4iout]is given by:SOCi (k) = SOCi (\u03c4iin)+k\u22121\u2211\u03c4=\u03c4iinci (\u03c4).\u2206TBi(3.2)where SOCi (\u03c4iin) is the initial SOC for the ith EV when it plugs in. The maximum achievableSOC for the ith EV is given by:SOCimax = min*,1, SOCi (\u03c4iin)+cimax(\u03c4iout\u2212 \u03c4iin).\u2206TBi+- (3.3)where cimax is the maximum charge rate (kW) of the ith EV charge point. A feasible chargingprofile is a charging profile which satisfies both plug-in constraints and the state of chargecondition, i.e. SOCi (M) = SOCimax [58]. The following are also defined:1. Aggregate non-EV base load at time k is given by:b(k) :=N\u2211j=1h j (k). (3.4)2. Aggregate non-EV base load profile is defined as:bT := [b(1),b(2), ...,b(M)] . (3.5)3.2.2 Plug-in ConstraintsThe ratings of both the EV charge point and vehicle battery impose constraints on the feasiblecharge rates which can be drawn from the charging socket by each EV. These are describedin the following. For the ith EV, the maximum charge rate is denoted by cimax. Consideringthe charging rate over the course of the full M time slots and noting that charging can onlytake place when the EV is plugged in and not already fully charged, the constraints are givenas follows:If \u03c4iin \u2264 k \u2264 \u03c4iout,0 \u2264 ci (k) \u2264 cimax, (3.6)If k \u2264 \u03c4iin, k \u2265 \u03c4iout, or SOCi (k) = 100%,ci (k) = 0. (3.7)3.2 Problem Formulation 363.2.3 Power System ConstraintsSome of the charging scenarios considered in the thesis explicitly take account of constraintson power system transformer loading levels and voltage profiles. The total loading conditionsfor each transformer Prsub(k), r \u2208 S0 at each time slot k is inspected, and the voltage for eachconnected node Vi (k) is used to evaluate the voltage level at each sample step. In this context,the power flow for the r th transformer can be expressed as:Prsub(k) =\u2211j\u2208\u03a6rhh j (k)+\u2211i\u2208\u03a6rcci (k), \u2200r \u2208 {1,2, ..., S} . (3.8)Accordingly, the total power flow for the main substation is defined as:P0sub(k) =S\u2211r=1Prsub(k). (3.9)In practice, equations (3.8) and (3.9) would not be evaluated explicitly, rather the relevantpower flows would be measured directly at the transformers and would therefore alsoinclude distribution system losses. Letting T Rrmax denote the maximum power rating for ther th transformer, the power flow constraint can be expressed as:Prsub(k) \u2264 T Rrmax, \u2200r \u2208 S0. (3.10)In a similar fashion, defining the minimum acceptable voltage level as Vmin, the voltageconstraint is given by:Vi (k) \u2265 Vmin, \u2200i \u2208 N. (3.11)While the voltage level can be measured at each charge point, in general for monitoringpurposes it only needs to be checked at the end of each phase since this will be the pointwhere voltage violations will occur first.3.2.4 Types of OptimisationFrom a modelling perspective, different desired EV charging behaviours can be expressedas cost functions that need to be optimised. Typically cost functions for EV charging canbe divided into two groups. The first are temporally based cost functions J (C) that evaluateactions taken over a period of time. The second are instantaneous cost functions J (c(k)) thatonly consider the current sample step.In the case of temporal optimisation, which is essentially a scheduling problem, theoptimum solution requires a priori knowledge of all relevant parameters over the optimisation3.3 Fairness based EV Charging Strategies 37horizon, k \u2208 M, such that the full charge rate matrix C can be determined, leading to sub-optimal solutions due to the uncertainty surrounding the predicted loads. These problems aretypically computationally challenging and do not scale well. Typical temporal optimisationobjectives include:\u2022 Minimising the total charging costs for all EVs over the course of all time slots [196].\u2022 Minimising the total energy losses on power transmission lines during EV chargingperiods [184].\u2022 Minimising the load variance (thereby flattening the load profile) [58],[21].On the other hand, instantaneous cost functions are defined in terms of the informationavailable at the current sample step, and hence are not subject to the uncertainty associatedwith load prediction, PEV availability, etc. Also, they are typically more amenable todecentralised implementation than temporal methods. However, as these functions only caterfor the conditions at the current sample step, they typically cannot accommodate global orlong term objectives. Examples of instantaneous optimisation objectives include:\u2022 Charge rate based fairness [189]. (Here, the objective is to minimise the differencebetween the charge rates of EVs while distributing the available power among EVs.)\u2022 Price based fairness [48]. (In this case, charging fairness is defined from the perspectiveof the charging cost. In this problem, we expect the allocated charge rate of each EVto be proportional to the amount of money they would like to pay.)\u2022 Maximising available power utilisation [163]. (Here, utility companies wish to max-imise the power delivered to charging EVs.)3.3 Fairness based EV Charging StrategiesIn this section we review the principles of a number of fairness based EV charging algorithmsthat have been recently proposed in the literature. In Sections 3.3.1 to 3.3.4, we introducethe charging algorithms which are classed as \u2018continuous\u2019, that is algorithms that explicitlyrequire that the charge rate of the ith EV can be adjusted continuously to any value in therange [0,cimax]. The performance of these algorithms will be compared in Section 3.7.2 and3.7.3. Further, in Section 3.3.5 and 3.3.6 we review the mechanisms of two on-off based EVcharging strategies, where we require that the charge rate of the ith EV can only adopt one oftwo values, 0 or cimax. We shall compare the performances of both algorithms in Section 3.8.3.3 Fairness based EV Charging Strategies 383.3.1 Uncontrolled Charging StrategyUncontrolled charging, also known as uncoordinated charging or dumb charging, is whereeach EV begins charging at the maximum rate once it is plugged in, and continues chargingat this rate until fully charged. The negative consequences of this approach for grid operationhave been highlighted in many studies, see for example [32] and [163]. In the worst casescenario, if all EVs start to charge during peak load hours, then peak power requirementswill be increased significantly and local distribution networks will likely be overloaded.This charging strategy can be viewed as the solution to the following temporal optimisationproblem:maxCM\u2211k=1N\u2211i=1SOCi (k)subject to: Plug-in constraints(3.12)3.3.2 Decentralised AIMD AlgorithmThe basic idea of AIMD was originally applied in the context of network communication forproviding a fair congestion control scheme to support best-effort traffic in the Internet [218].To date, this idea has been greatly explored in the network communication community; formany novel protocols and applications see [19, 33, 99, 104, 176, 178, 179, 212]. The AIMDapproach was first proposed in [189] in developing a charging context to distribute availablepower between customers in a variety of user oriented charging scenarios (e.g. domestic,workplace, motorway service station, shopping mall and parking area charging). In thedomestic charging scenario, each active EV charge point executes the basic decentralisedAIMD algorithm defined in Algorithm 1.Comment: In practice some distributed/decentralised algorithms (e.g. AIMD) can be im-plemented in an iterative fashion with different sampling interval (rather than \u2206T) duringeach time slot k. The interval of each algorithm iteration depends on the computationalcapabilities of the EV charge points and the technologies of the communication infrastruc-tures. For practical implementation of the algorithms, we could further discretise each timeslot k into T same clock periods (each of length \u2206t), indexed by t \u2208 {1,2, ...,T }. Thus, forthese algorithms EV charge rates will be adjusted at every (shorter) time slot t and the EVcharging constraints need to be satisfied at time slot t as well. We shall expect that at theend of the iteration of each time slot k, the algorithm could approximately converge (due tonumerical approximation) to a solution that equivalents to the optimal solution calculated bya centralised based approach.3.3 Fairness based EV Charging Strategies 39Algorithm 1 Basic Decentralised AIMD Charging Algorithm1: while battery not charged, at every time slot k do2: for each t \u2208 {1,2, ...,T } do3: if capacity event then4: generate uniform random number, p \u2208 [0,1]5: if p < pi then6: ci (t +1) = \u03b2(1)ci (t)7: else8: ci (t +1) = \u03b2(2)ci (t)9: end if10: else11: ci (t +1) = min(cimax,ci (t)+\u03b1\u2206t)12: end if13: end for14: end whileIn Algorithm 1 \u03b1 is an additive constant value in kW/s; \u03b2(1) and \u03b2(2) are multiplicativeconstants. During operation each EV charge point additively increases its charge rate untila \u201ccapacity event\u201d occurs at which point it applies a multiplicative constant to decrease itscharge rate. The multiplicative constants \u03b2(1) and \u03b2(2) are chosen by the ith charge pointwith probability pi and 1\u2212 pi respectively. A capacity event is deemed to have occurred whenthe total power demanded by all active EV charger points exceeds the maximum availablepower that can be provided for charging, that is at each time slot k:N\u2211i=1ci (t) \u2265 Pevav (k), \u2200t \u2208 {1,2, ...,T } (3.13)In the decentralised AIMD framework proposed in [189] the capacity event condition(3.13) is monitored by a central monitoring station server at the main distribution networksubstation which broadcasts a message to the charge points when events occur. Thus, thedecentralised AIMD approach assumes a simple radial communication topology, as depictedin Figure 3.2, with each EV charge point equipped with a communication device that is ableto receive signals broadcast by the central monitoring station.The key characteristic of the basic AIMD charging algorithm is that it guarantees anequitable \u2018average\u2019 distribution of the available power between active EV charge points ifeach charge point chooses the same \u03b1, \u03b2(1), \u03b2(2) and pi parameters [178]. The eleganceof the approach is that it achieves this desirable property while requiring a minimum ofcommunication infrastructure and only limited computing capabilities on each EV. In addition,the simple communication topology and minimal communication bandwidth make it a highly3.3 Fairness based EV Charging Strategies 40Fig. 3.2 Decentralised AIMD smart charging communication topologyscalable and cost effective solution [99, 116]. In this context, the fair AIMD chargingalgorithm can be thought of as providing an approximate distributed solution to the followingoptimisation problem:minc(k)N\u2211i=1[ci (k)\u2212 1NN\u2211i=1ci (k)]2subject to:\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3N\u2211i=1ci (k) = Pevav (k),\u2200k \u2208 MPlug-in constraintsPower system constraints (enhanced)\uf8fc\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fd\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fe(3.14)3.3.3 Distributed Price Feedback AlgorithmIn this section, we introduce the basic idea of the DPF algorithm proposed in [48]. After thatwe show how the algorithm can be modified to fit the mathematical framework consideredin Section 3.2. At the beginning of the EV charging process, each EV owner provides aWillingness To Pay (WTP) parameter, \u03c9i > 0, that is used to determine their charge rate. Ingeneral, the larger \u03c9i the more charge a vehicle can expect to receive, and in the absence3.3 Fairness based EV Charging Strategies 41of power system or plug-in constraints available power is distributed proportionally to \u03c9i.During every time slot k, the price signal E(t) in this algorithm is then defined as:E(t) = f (N\u2211i=1ci (t)), \u2200t \u2208 {1,2, ...,T } (3.15)where f (x) is given byf (x) = a(xPevav (k))d (3.16)where a and d are both positive constants.Each EV i is associated with a utility function \u00b5i (x) with respect to the charging demandx at each charging time slot. \u00b5i (x) is a non-decreasing function to achieve proportional fairpricing defined as:\u00b5i (x) = \u03c9i log(x) (3.17)Hence, our objective is that each EV charge point chooses ci (t) to maximise its net profit:\u00b5i (ci (t))\u2212 ci (t)E(t) (3.18)According to [48], the ith EV charge point adapts its charge rate using the following equationto maximise the above utility function:ci (t +1) = ci (t)+\u03b3i (\u03c9i \u2212 ci (t)E(t)) (3.19)Here \u03b3i is a parameter that controls the rate of convergence of the algorithm. The charge rateof each EV is updated according to the feedback pricing signal E(t) and its WTP parameter\u03c9i. The mechanism for implementation of the basic DPF algorithm is illustrated as follows.Algorithm 2 Distributed Price Feedback Charging Algorithmwhile battery not charged, at every time slot k dofor each t \u2208 {1,2, ...,T } doSend ci (t) to the central infrastructureGet E(t) from the central infrastructureUpdate ci (t) using (3.19)end forend while3.3 Fairness based EV Charging Strategies 42This strategy can be used to provide a distributed solution similar to solving the followingoptimisation problem:minc(k)N\u2211i=1[ci (k)\u03c9i\u2212 1Nn\u2211i=1\u03c9i .ci (k)]2subject to:\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3N\u2211i=1ci (k) = Pevav (k),\u2200k \u2208 Mci (k)cj (k)=\u03c9i\u03c9 j, \u2200i , j \u2208 N,\u2200k \u2208 MPlug-in constraints (enhanced)Power system constraints (enhanced)\uf8fc\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fd\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fe(3.20)Comment: The constraintN\u2211i=1ci (k) = Pevav (k) in both (3.14) and (3.20) is considered to avoidtrivial solutions. In addition, the power system constraint is not considered in the decentralisedAIMD algorithm in [189] and both plug-in constraint and power system constraints are notconsidered in the DPF algorithm in [48]. However, as a necessary option for the grid, weshall consider these constraints in the proposed enhanced algorithms in Section 3.4. Thus,the enhanced AIMD and DPF could provide approximate solutions to optimisation problemsin (3.14) and (3.20) with the included constraints depicted by (enhanced).3.3.4 Ideal Centralised Instantaneous ChargingIn this section, we introduce an ideal centralised instantaneous charging (ICIC) solutionbased on a hierarchical structure. At sample step k, all charging EVs are required to sendtheir charging requests cimax to their local transformers. Each local transformer calculatesthe charge rate for each EV i in the r th area, taking into account the current local capacityT Rrmax\u2212 Prsub(k), and forwards the power requirements to the main substation. If the totalamount of requested power exceeds the available power, the main substation T R(0) allocatesthe available power to each substation in proportion to the requested values. Each substationthen updates their EV charge rates accordingly and broadcasts the information to the chargepoints. This strategy is feasible for solving the following optimisation problem.minc(k)N\u2211i=1[ci (k)\u2212 1NN\u2211i=1ci (k)]2subject to:\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3Plug-in constraintsN\u2211i=1ci (k) = Pevav (k),\u2200k \u2208 MPrsub(k) \u2264 T Rrmax,\u2200r \u2208 S\uf8fc\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fd\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fe(3.21)3.3 Fairness based EV Charging Strategies 43Fig. 3.3 Flow chart of the distributed charging algorithmNote: Voltage constraints are not considered within this formulation for the sake of simplicity.3.3.5 Distributed On-Off ChargingIn this section, we consider a distributed on-off based EV charging algorithm that has beenrecently proposed in [192]. The algorithm, based on a learning automation method, is used tocontrol the operation of a fleet of EVs connected to on-off type chargers in order to maximisethe utilisation of the available power. To this end, an ergodic Markov Chain based distributedcontrol system is formulated to analyse the charging dynamics of each EV. Depending onwhether a congestion signal is received or not, each EV can automatically turn on or turn offits charging according to the determined probability at each time step. This algorithm hasbeen demonstrated to be capable of converging to a fair allocation of available power for EVcharging. The flow chart of this distributed charging algorithm is depicted in Figure 3.3. Inthis algorithm, \u00b5i, \u00b5+i and \u03b2i are the parameters for the turn-off phase and \u03bbi,\u03bb+i and \u03b1i arefor the turn-on phase. For a detailed description of the algorithm, please refer to [192].3.4 Enhanced Charging Strategies 443.3.6 Centralised On-Off ChargingThe centralised charging algorithm proposed here is partly inspired by the optimal EVcharging algorithm in [164], where a linear programming technique is employed to solve theoptimisation problem. Here, a similar framework is applied which is adapted to deal withbinary control actions. A technique based on MILP is employed to maximise the availablepower utilisation while satisfying grid constraints. The voltage deviations at each nodeare calculated at each time step by using voltage sensitivity analysis. Hence, the voltageconstraint for EV charging point i at time step k in (3.11) becomes\u00b5ici (k)+N\u2211j=1; j,i\u00b5 jic j (k)+Vi (k) \u2265 Vmin. (3.22)Here, \u00b5i represents the voltage sensitivity at ith charge point due to an EV charging at chargepoint i and \u00b5 ji is the sensitivity of charge point i to an EV charging at charge point j [164].Let A be a N \u00d7 N voltage constraint matrix containing \u00b5i in the diagonals and \u00b5 ji as offdiagonal elements. Then a MILP optimisation problem incorporating the voltage constraintcan be defined as [164]:maxxeTxsubject to: Ax \u2264 d(3.23)where x \u2208 RN is the state of the EVs with entries either 0 or 1 representing the off and onstate, respectively, of each EV. e \u2208 RN is a coefficient vector with all one entries. A \u2208 RN\u00d7Nis the voltage sensitivity matrix. d \u2208 RN is the vector with the maximum voltage deviationfrom the current node voltage to the corresponding voltage limit. These matrices are thenaugmented to also include the phase load constraint and transformer loading constraints asspecified in (3.10) .3.4 Enhanced Charging StrategiesThe distributed EV charging algorithms outlined above do not take into account any powersystem constraints. However, as previously explained, maintaining these grid constraints iscritical to meeting consumer power quality guarantees and ensuring the state and reliableoperation of the power grid. Therefore, we adapt the distributed algorithms to react toviolations of these constraints in this section. It should be remarked that, due to the similaritiesin applying the enhancement methods to different distributed algorithms, as an example, weshall only elaborate our enhancement approaches to the basic AIMD algorithm. However,3.4 Enhanced Charging Strategies 45the enhanced performance of different algorithms other than AIMD, i.e., enhanced DPF(EnDPF) and enhanced distributed on-off Charging, are also summarised in Sections 3.7 and3.8 respectively.In addition, we introduce a heuristic method to regulate the available power in responseto a varying electricity price to affect a shift in EV loads away from periods of high demand,thereby reducing peak-power capacity requirements and ultimately the costs to the consumer.The overall objective for the enhanced charging strategies is to achieve benefit for bothutilities and customers with all EVs sharing the maximum amount of available power fairlywhile ensuring that the distribution network continues to operate within acceptable limits.3.4.1 Communication Topology and Infrastructure RequirementsIn order to incorporate power system constraints into the decentralized AIMD chargingalgorithm in a practical and scalable way a hierarchical communication topology parallelingthe topology of the grid is proposed, as shown in Figure 3.4. The complexity of the commu-nication and charger infrastructure required depends on the power system constraints that aretaken into account.At its simplest the AIMD algorithm only requires the broadcasting capability of the mainsubstation sever and the receiving capability of each EV charger as envisaged by [189] anddepicted in Figure 3.2. However, equivalently, this can be implemented in a cascaded fashionas shown in Figure 3.4 with the central monitoring station at the main distribution substationrelaying its generation capacity event broadcasts to the local distribution substations, whichin turn relay the broadcast to the EV charge points in their local area.An advantage of this hierarchical approach is that it reduces transmitter power require-ments and can take advantage of existing communication infrastructure that typically existson the transmission network. More importantly, it offers the possibility of responding to localinfrastructure capacity events such as overloading of a substation transformer. To enablethis each substation has to have a local monitoring station (substation server) to receivegeneration capacity event broadcasts from the central monitoring station (main substationserver), detect local infrastructure capacity events and broadcast capacity event informationto the charge points in its area. It should be noted that since the AIMD algorithm does notdistinguish between capacity event types no modifications are required to the EV chargepoints to accommodate infrastructure capacity events.However, this is not the case for line voltage events. Since line voltage issues areinherently local to the user, they cannot be detected at the local substation. Instead they haveto be sensed by the individual EV charge points and the information relayed back to thelocal substation. Therefore, in order to respond to voltage events each EV charger needs to3.4 Enhanced Charging Strategies 46Fig. 3.4 Communication topology for the enhanced AIMD implementationhave the capability to continuously sense its own socket voltage and transmit a voltage eventmessage to its local substation when the voltage drops below an acceptable level.3.4.2 Enhanced AIMD Charging StrategyWith the appropriate communication and sensing infrastructure in place, as outlined above,the basic AIMD smart charging algorithm running on each charge point can be modifiedto respond to voltage, infrastructure and generation capacity events as shown in Algorithm3. Recalling that, Vi (k) is the line voltage of the ith EV charge point at the k th time instant.Here, Vevent is a threshold voltage level below which a voltage event is triggered and voltageevent message transmitted to the local substation server, and Vmin < Vevent is the minimumacceptable voltage level below which the EV charger enters a protective self regulation mode.The remaining parameters are as defined previously for the basic AIMD implementation.The local monitoring station for a given area broadcasts a capacity event signal to theactive EV charge points in its area if any of the following conditions are satisfied:\u2022 A generation capacity event is broadcast by the main substation.\u2022 A voltage event message is transmitted by any of the charge points in its local area\u2022 A local infrastructure constraint violation is detected (e.g. transformer overload)3.4 Enhanced Charging Strategies 47Algorithm 3 Enhanced Decentralised AIMD Charging Algorithmwhile battery not charged, at every time slot k dofor each t \u2208 {1,2, ...,T } doif capacity event thengenerate uniform random number, p \u2208 [0,1]if p < pi thenci (t +1) = \u03b2(1)ci (t)elseci (t +1) = \u03b2(2)ci (t)end ifelseci (t +1) = min(cimax,ci (t)+\u03b1\u2206t)end ifif Vi (t) < Vevent thentransmits a voltage event message (treated as a local capacity event signal)end ifif Vi (t) < Vmin then (self regulation)ci (t +1) = 0end ifend forend whileIn addition to monitoring infrastructure constraints, the central monitoring station at themain substation is responsible for determining the power available Pav(k) at every time slotk and broadcasting a generation capacity event when P0sub(t) > Pav(k), \u2200t \u2208 {1,2, ...,T }.Compared to the basic AIMD EV charging strategy, the enhanced AIMD (EnAIMD)implementation offers greater protection to the grid infrastructure and optimum usage ofavailable power. For example, if one of the local transformers is overloaded but overall gener-ation capacity is not being exceeded at the main substation, the basic AIMD implementationwould fail to respond, while the enhanced implementation will decrease only the chargerates of the EVs in the corresponding local area to protect the transformer. The basic AIMDcharging solution in these circumstances would require that charge rates of EVs in unaffectedareas also be reduced, but this would lead to under utilisation of available generating capacity.While responding to voltage constraint violations within the AIMD framework addssubstantially to the complexity of EV charge point infrastructure the local sensing of voltageat each EV allows a degree of self-regulation/fail-safe mode to be introduced whereby eachEV switches off whenever the detected line voltage drops below a minimum acceptablelevel, Vmin, irrespective of whether a capacity event has been received or not. Since severegeneration capacity and infrastructure overloading events generally cause significant voltage3.5 Valley-Filling based Charging Strategies 48issues, this offers a degree of robustness to communication system failures. In practice,this self regulation mode will only rarely be activated provided there is a sufficient marginbetween Vmin and Vevent.3.4.3 Price-adjusted Available PowerAIMD is inherently an instantaneous algorithm with no temporal visibility hence it cannottake a longer term view in determining EV charge rates. However, a simple heuristicmodification can be introduced to the available power calculation that allows the temporalcontext to be taken into account in a meaningful way with negligible impact on overall systemcomplexity. The heuristic is to modulate the available power signal Pav(k) with time-of-usepricing information so that an artificial reduction in available power is created at times ofhigh electricity prices, that is,Ptou(k) = Pav(k)\u2212 \u03be (E(k)\u2212Emin(k)) (3.24)Here \u03be is a constant tuning parameter, E(k) (cent/kWh) is the Time-of-Use (TOU) price attime k and Emin is the minimum TOU price during the day. Since the TOU prices reflect thepeak demand periods on the grid, this modification essentially drives EV load to off-peaktimes. To implement price-adjusted AIMD charging the only additional requirement is thatTOU pricing be made available to the central monitoring station. Where this information ispre-defined and fixed [169], it can be pre-programmed into the central monitoring stationsoftware. Otherwise it can be periodically relayed to the station via a communication link.3.5 Valley-Filling based Charging StrategiesIn this section, we present two typical EV charging strategies, namely optimal decentralisedvalley-filling charging and centralised load-variance-minimisation charging, aimed at achiev-ing valley-filling for the grid. We give the descriptions of both strategies with regard to ouroptimisation framework.3.5.1 Optimal Decentralised Valley-Filling ChargingIn [58], Gan et al. proposed a novel decentralised temporal optimisation algorithm, namelyoptimal decentralised valley-filling (ODVF), to optimally schedule EV charging to performvalley filling through an iterative process. It has been shown that the charging profile for each3.5 Valley-Filling based Charging Strategies 49EV can reach optimality within a few iterations and that the approach provides satisfactoryperformance and is robust to errors in users\u2019 specifications and outdated signals.In order to minimise the load variance (valley-filling) by the ODVF method, the followingis solved:minCM\u2211k=1[N\u2211i=1ci (k)+ b(k)]2subject to:\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3Plug-in constraintsP0sub(k) \u2264 T R0maxSOCi (M) = SOCimax,\u2200i \u2208 N\uf8fc\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fd\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fe(3.25)where b(k) denotes the k th element of base load profile b. Please refer to [58] for details ofthe algorithm implementation.3.5.2 Centralised Load-Variance-Minimisation ChargingIn this case, the optimisation problem is formulated as a quadratic programming problem, theaim of which is to flatten the overall load profile, i.e., valley-filling. Compared to the ODVFmethod, as defined in Section 3.5.1, this charging strategy, denoted CLVM, gathers all thenecessary information from both the grid and EV customers before solving the quadraticoptimisation problem, in order to determine the optimal charge rate matrix C before chargingcommences. Mathematically the optimisation problem is given by equations (3.26) and(3.27) presented below.J (C) =M\u2211k=1(P0sub(k)\u2212P0sub)2 (3.26)where P0sub is defined as the average power consumption measured at the main transformerover the course of M time slots.In each case the optimisation problem is defined asminCJ (C)subject to:\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f3 Plug-in constraintsSOCi (M) = SOCimax,\u2200i \u2208 N\uf8fc\uf8f4\uf8fd\uf8f4\uf8fe(3.27)where the SOC constraint is necessary to avoid the trivial solution C = 0.3.6 Cost Minimisation based Strategies 503.6 Cost Minimisation based StrategiesIn this section, we introduce decentralised and centralised cost minimisation based EVcharging strategies for minimising total charging costs of EV customers with respect to agiven TOU pricing suggested in [169].3.6.1 Decentralised Selfish Charging StrategyIn this charging strategy it is assumed that charging is conducted in a decentralised fashionby each EV guided only by TOU pricing information (assumed to be available a priori)and plug-in constraints. TOU information motivates EV owners to shift their demands tocheaper price periods. Therefore, in decentralised selfish charging (DSC) each EV optimisesits charging schedule in order to meet its charging requirements at the minimum cost withno regard for the impact on the power system. Mathematically the DSC formulation can beviewed as solving the follows optimisation problem:minciM\u2211k=1ci (k).\u2206T .E(k), \u2200i \u2208 Nsubject to:\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f3 Plug-in constraintsSOCi (M) = SOCimax,\u2200i \u2208 N\uf8fc\uf8f4\uf8fd\uf8f4\uf8fe(3.28)3.6.2 Centralised Charging Cost Minimisation StrategyIn this section, a centralised charging cost minimisation (CCCM) strategy based on linearprogramming is proposed to minimise the total cost of charging EVs. Using this method, thecharge rate matrix of all EV charge points C is determined at a centralised control centre.Rather than updating the charge rate locally according to some feedback signals (e.g. pricesignal) at every time slot, centralised approaches are more amenable to fulfilling temporalbased objectives (e.g. minimising total charging costs, valley-filling). We assume that at thebeginning of the scheduling window, all required information is provided to the optimisationprogram for computation in the control centre. This information includes the predicted baseload b defined in (3.5) and the charging schedule of each EV, i.e., \u03c4iin and \u03c4iout.3.7 Comparisons of \u2018Continuous\u2019 EV Charging Strategies 51In this case, the optimisation problem is taken as a centralised scheduling problem tominimise total charging costs. The mathematical formulation can be defined considering theSOC of all EVs, power system constraints and plug-in constraints:minCM\u2211k=1N\u2211i=1ci (k).\u2206T .E(k)subject to:\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3Plug-in constraintsPower system constraintsSOCi (M) = SOCimax,\u2200i \u2208 N\uf8fc\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fd\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fe(3.29)Comment: If the power system constraints are omitted, the solution to the optimisationproblem defined in (3.29) is mathematically equivalent to the solution of (3.28). Thus, CCCMis an enhancement of DSC since it is not practical to incorporate power system constraintsin the DSC method. However, this is at the expense of substantial communication andcomputation overhead.3.7 Comparisons of \u2018Continuous\u2019 EV Charging StrategiesIn this section, the performance of all continuous EV charging strategies are compared in atypical low-voltage distribution network in a residential area. In Section 3.8, the performanceof the on-off charging strategies are evaluated in a SME area for another scenario of interest.3.7.1 Simulation SetupIn order to compare the performance of the different charging strategies in a residential area, aone day simulation was run with \u2206T set to 5 minutes and \u2206t set to 5 seconds. The simulationwas conducted on a residential low-voltage distribution network with S = 3 and N = 160. Thehouses are distributed evenly across phases with maximum 50% EVs randomly connected inthree household areas. The topology of the network is given in Figure 3.1.This distribution network was modelled and implemented using a custom OpenDSS/ Mat-lab simulation platform. OpenDSS [44], an open source electric power system DistributionSystem Simulator, was used to simulate the power system and calculate the instantaneouspower flows and voltage profiles for the test network. Matlab was used to simulate typicalresidential EV connection, SOC and disconnection patterns (randomly generated for eachEV) and to create a wrapper programme to simulate the operation of the network over aperiod of time for varying household and EV loads based on various charging strategies. Themain steps performed by the wrapper programme are summarised in Algorithm 4.3.7 Comparisons of \u2018Continuous\u2019 EV Charging Strategies 52Algorithm 4 OpenDSS-Matlab Wrapper Programme for EV Charging Simulationfor k = 1,2, . . .,M do1.

For instance,the selected algorithms in the fifth step could include AIMD, DPF, ICIC, distributed on-offand their extended versions. Note that temporal based charging approaches (e.g. CCCM andCLVM) are not included here since they require different simulation setups.Residential power consumption profiles for each scenario were generated based onresidential customer smart meter electricity trial data provided by the Commission for EnergyRegulation (CER) [26] in Ireland. This dataset consists of time series demand data for 4225residential customers over 536 days, sampled every 30 minutes starting from 15thof July2009. The non-EV household load profiles for each of the 160 houses in the test networkwere generated by randomly selecting load profiles from the CER dataset and upsamplingthem using linear interpolation to the desired sampling interval \u2206T . To illustrate this dataset,we consider a typical summer scenario from the period 22nd of July to 24th of July 2009, anda winter scenario from the period 22nd of January to 24th of January 2010. A comparisondiagram of the average load consumption for 4225 residential smart meters during bothperiods is shown in Figure 3.5. As expected this shows that the average power consumptionduring typical Irish winter days is much higher than during summer days. In particular,the peak power consumption during the three winter days is more than 50% greater thanthe summer peaks. In our simulation study we consider a typical winter day scenario forbetter illustration of the performance of the algorithms. The average non-EV household loadconsumption in each of our charging scenarios is illustrated in Figure 3.6.3.7 Comparisons of \u2018Continuous\u2019 EV Charging Strategies 5312am 12pm 12am + [1d] 12pm 12am + [2d] 12pm 12am + [3d]0.20.40.60.811.21.41.61.822.2Time (hours)Power (kW)  SummerWinterFig. 3.5 Average summer and winter residential power consumption profiles in Ireland ascomputed from smart meter trial data of 4225 customers [26]12pm 4pm 8pm 12am 4am 8am 12pm0.40.60.811.21.41.61.822.22.4Time(hours)Power (kW)Fig. 3.6 Average residential power consumption profiles for 160 customers on January 23rd2010 [26]3.7 Comparisons of \u2018Continuous\u2019 EV Charging Strategies 54The assumptions on EV travelling patterns, and hence SOC and plug-in/out probabilitydistributions, were taken from [36]. For EV connection patterns, we assume that EVs arrivehome and connect to the charge points between 4pm-7pm (21% of all daily journeys inIrish Urban area) with the following time distribution: 4pm-5pm (33%), 5pm-6pm (38%),6pm-7pm (29%). Similarly, for EV disconnection patterns, we assume that most of themdepart from home between 7am and 10am (19% of all daily journeys in Irish Urban areas)with the following time distribution: 7am-8am (21%), 8am-9am (47%), 9am-10am (32%).The battery capacity for each EV was assumed to be 20kWh and the initial energy requiredfor each EV was normally distributed. The mean of the distribution was set to 10kWhand the standard deviation was chosen as 1.5kWh. This means 99.9% of the EVs requirebetween 5kWh and 15kWh and 81.8% require between 8kWh and 12kWh to fully chargetheir batteries. For comparison purposes, the same plug-in/out and SOC values were usedwith each method considered. It was assumed that all EVs charged overnight and that oncean EV was plugged in it only physically plugged out at the scheduled plug-out time.Several assumptions are also made with regard to EVs and residential EV charginginfrastructure, which are consistent with previous studies in [164, 189]. The assumptions areas follows.1. The nominal voltage of each EV charge point is set at 230V.2. The maximum power output from the EV home charger cannot exceed 3.7kW.3. The maximum available power can be provided from the grid is 400kVA.4. Each EV has the ability to adapt its charge rate in real-time and continuously.5. Power flow for EV charging is unidirectional from grid to vehicle (i.e. vehicle-to-gridis not considered).We now present a comparison of the listed charging strategies grouped according to theirdifferent characteristics as follows:1. Uncoordinated charging strategy2. Fairness based (continuous chargers) strategies : AIMD, DPF, EnAIMD, EnDPF andICIC and their TOU price adjusted extensions3. Cost minimisation strategies: DSC and CCCM4. Valley-Filling strategies: ODVF and CLVM3.7 Comparisons of \u2018Continuous\u2019 EV Charging Strategies 553.7.2 Evaluation of the Uncoordinated Charging StrategyAs already noted in Section 3.3.1, uncontrolled charging is where each EV is charged at itsmaximum rate once it is plugged in and continues charging at this rate until it is fully charged.In this section, different penetration levels of EVs on the network were examined to evaluatethe impact of uncontrolled charging on both the power grid and customers. As shown inFigure 3.7, the minimum non-EV voltage on all buses during the peak-periods was foundto be 0.9538pu (219.36Volts). With uncontrolled EV charging coinciding with peak-powerseveral bus voltages drop below 0.95pu (the minimum accepted voltage on the grid), with theminimum voltage found to be 0.9151pu around 7pm.The power flow at the substation and all local transformers are marginally overloadedduring peak times as a result of EV charging in the case of 10% EV penetration, as can beseen in Figure 3.8. In the case of 50% EV penetration, maximum loading occurs around8pm and exceeds the available power by 43.56%. Thus, for our test distribution network,uncontrolled charging at 50% EV penetration cannot be supported.3.7.3 Evaluation of Continuous Fairness based Charging StrategiesIn this section, the performance of the different fairness based charging strategies is discussed.In the DPF method, the WTP parameter was chosen to be 1, 2 or 3 randomly (with sameprobability) by each EV. In the case of the ICIC algorithm, results are presented only forthe implementation without the voltage limitation condition. For all methods, the utilityregulatory factor \u03be in equation (3.24) was set to 10 so that only limited available power can beaccessed during peak times. The resultant power and voltage profiles, and the profile of theloading of the second transformer are presented in Figures 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11, respectively.The results show that both AIMD and DPF provide a good approximation to the idealsolution, and as such are competitive alternatives to the ideal solution given the substantiallyreduced communication overhead associated with their distributed implementation. DPFhas the advantage that by using its price-feedback approach it is able to provide users witha charge rate proportional to their WTP in their local area (local fairness is maintainedat each given time instance), which is demonstrated in Figure 3.12. The averaged chargerate obtained by DPF method for EVs connected in a given area (TR(2)) was calculated as0.94kW, 1.42kW and 1.76kW by means of slow (WTP = 1), normal (WTP = 2) and fastcharging (WTP = 3), respectively. It should be mentioned that the average charge rate for thedifferent EVs is not necessarily proportional to their WTP parameters, due to the impact oflocal power system and charging infrastructure constraints.

This will be discussed in Section 3.9.3.7.4 Evaluation of Cost Minimisation StrategiesIn this section, the two charging strategies designed to minimise charging costs, namelyDSC and CCCM, are applied to the distribution network with 50% EV penetration and TOUpricing as given in Figure 3.13. Simulation results show that DSC, which has no regard forpower system constraints, violates local transformer loading constraints even if EV chargingis delayed to off-peak times (around 12am), while 50% EV penetration can be comfortablyaccommodated on the network with CCCM, as shown in Figure 3.14 and the transformerloading indexes reported in Table 3.4. However, CCCM needs to gather information fromEVs and also from the power grid, hence it has substantial scalability issues compared toDSC.3.7.5 Evaluation of Valley-Filling Charging StrategiesFor the following simulations, a simplification is made by assuming that all EVs share acommon plug-out time of 6am. As can be seen in Figure 3.15 and Table 3.4, the performanceof the ODVF method, when it is allowed a number of iterations (e.g. 20 algorithm iterationsin this case), is comparable to that of CLVM. Most significantly, the ODVF method givesa significant reduction in computation time compared to the CLVM method as illustratedin Tables 3.2 and 3.3. These times are calculated using quadprog in Matlab using a DellComputer with a Win7 64bits operation system (RAM: 6GB, CPU: Inter(R) Core(TM)i7-2600, 3.4GHz). Thus it is easy to observe the significant advantages of applying theODVF method versus the CLVM method from the perspective of computation times.The performance of the ODVF method was also evaluated from the perspective of theMean Square Error (MSE) between the iterative load profile and the optimal aggregated loadprofile using the CLVM method. In particular, Figure 3.16 illustrates that the ODVF methodis capable of achieving 90% of the CLVM based optimum within 6 iterations.3.8 Comparisons of On-Off EV Charging StrategiesIn this section, we consider a SME scenario where on-off EV charging strategies are imple-mented in a low-voltage distribution network. This scenario is attractive since it can be usedto represent a typical working area, for instance, a certain number of EVs are charging in3.8 Comparisons of On-Off EV Charging Strategies 59Table 3.1 A comparison of simulation results for various EV charging strategies (50% EVpenetration)StrategiesAveaTime(h)StdbTime(h)MincTime(h)MaxdTime(h)NoEV n/a n/a n/a n/aUncontrolled 2.80 0.38 1.83 3.83AIMD 7.53 0.88 5.42 9.17AIMD(P)e 8.34 1.05 5.92 10.08EnAIMD 7.89 1.63 4.58 10.83EnAIMD(P) 8.56 1.29 5.83 11.00DPF 7.86 1.84 4.42 11.42DPF(P) 8.71 1.81 5.00 12.33EnDPF 8.00 2.42 3.92 14.50EnDPF(P) 9.19 2.02 5.83 14.58ICIC 7.41 1.11 4.67 9.25ICIC(P) 8.24 1.10 5.67 10.08a Average charging time b Standard derivation of charging timec Minimum charging time d Maximum charging timee (P) for price-adjusted available powerStrategies Ave costsf(cents/kWh)Ave rateg(kW)Min Volth(pu)Max TRiLoading (%)OverloadjDuration(h)NoEV n/a n/a 0.954 112.93 2.25Uncontrolled 22.32 3.70 0.915 177.68 14.83AIMD 13.36 1.38 0.940 122.49 9.33AIMD(P) 11.21 1.25 0.941 113.92 6.58EnAIMD 12.74 1.36 0.953 112.93 2.75EnAIMD(P) 11.18 1.23 0.950 112.93 2.25DPF 13.93 1.36 0.946 122.17 9.33DPF(P) 11.30 1.22 0.947 113.91 5.83EnDPF 13.63 1.35 0.953 112.93 5.17EnDPF(P) 11.22 1.16 0.954 112.93 2.33ICIC 13.84 1.41 0.951 124.47 9.92ICIC(P) 11.20 1.27 0.945 116.01 5.75f Average EV charging costs g Average EV charging rateh Minimum voltage on the grid i Maximum percent of the transformer loading levelj Duration for transformers overloading3.8 Comparisons of On-Off EV Charging Strategies 6012pm 4pm 8pm 12am 4am 8am 12pm020406080100120140160Time(hours)Power(kVA)  AIMDDPFEnAIMDEnDPFICICFig. 3.11 Comparison of the loading conditions on transformer TR(2) with different chargingstrategies12pm 4pm 8pm 12am 4am 8am 12pm01234(a)Time(hours)Charge rates(kW)12pm 4pm 8pm 12am 4am 8am 12pm01234(b)Time(hours)Charge rates(kW)Fig. 3.12 Comparison of the charge rates in the same area [both connected to TR(2)] (a)Enhanced AIMD charging with price adjusted available power (b) Enhanced DPF chargingwith price adjusted available power3.8 Comparisons of On-Off EV Charging Strategies 6112pm 4pm 8pm 12am 4am 8am 12pm101520253035Time(hours)Price(cents/kWh)Fig. 3.13 Diagram of the TOU electricity price12pm 4pm 8pm 12am 4am 8am 12pm050100150200250300Time(hours)Power(kVA)  CCCM charging powerDSC charging powerUnmodified available powerPrice adjusted available powerFig. 3.14 Comparison of the EV load when using CCCM and DSC with the price adjustedavailable power modification3.8 Comparisons of On-Off EV Charging Strategies 62Table 3.2 ODVF computation time for different iteration counts (50% EV penetration).ODVF 5 10 15 20Time(s) 6.08 11.41 16.96 22.79Table 3.3 CLVM computation times with different levels of EV penetration.CLVM 10% 20% 30% 40% 50%Time(s) 20.87 104.72 236.02 789.23 2105.78Table 3.4 A comparison of simulation results for various temporal based EV chargingstrategies (50% EV penetration)StrategiesAveaTime(h)StdbTime(h)MincTime(h)MaxdTime(h)NoEV n/a n/a n/a n/aODVF 7.31 0.74 5.92 8.58CLVM 7.31 0.74 5.92 8.58DSC 8.88 0.26 7.92 9.00CCCM 8.89 0.27 7.92 9.00a Average charging time b Standard derivation of charging timec Minimum charging time d Maximum charging timeStrategiesAve costse(cents/kWh)Ave ratef(kW)Min Voltg(pu)Max TRhLoading (%)OverloadiDuration(h)NoEV n/a n/a 0.954 112.93 2.25ODVF 10.46 1.36 0.958 112.93 2.25CLVM 10.46 1.36 0.958 112.93 2.25DSC 10.00 1.13 0.954 112.93 2.61CCCM 10.00 1.11 0.954 112.93 2.25e Average EV charging costs f Average EV charging rateg Minimum voltage on the grid h Maximum percent of the transformer loading leveli Duration for transformers overloading3.8 Comparisons of On-Off EV Charging Strategies 6312pm 4pm 8pm 12am 4am 8am 12pm50100150200250300350400Time(hours)Power(kW)  Base load profileOptimal load profile1st iteration5th iteration15th iteration20th iterationFig. 3.15 Comparison of the optimal aggregated load profile obtained using CLVM and theiterative ODVF methods0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 200102030405060708090100Number of iterationPercentage (%)  ODVFCLVMFig. 3.16 Percentage obtained for CLVM and the iterative ODVF methods (in terms of MSE)with different numbers of iterations3.8 Comparisons of On-Off EV Charging Strategies 64a common parking lot near an office building. Next we introduce the simulation setup andevaluate the charging strategies using power system simulation.3.8.1 Simulation SetupIn order to compare the performance of different on-off based charging strategies, a low-voltage distribution network with 45 EV charge points and an office building was modelledusing the OpenDSS software [44], as illustrated in Figure 3.17. All charge points wereevenly distributed on each phase. The distance between each charge point was set to 10meters. At the source end of the network, a 10kV/400V (400kVA) \u2206/Y (grounded) twowindings step-down transformer was modelled. The voltage from the external grid wasset to 1.05pu and the minimum voltage level that can be tolerated on the grid was set to0.95pu. In addition, a 50kVA safety margin was reserved for the transformer for secureoperation. i.e. the maximum available power that can be drawn from the grid is 350kVA. Thedistance between each section of the three phase underground cable was set to 100meters.The aggregated load profile for the office building was generated by selecting several winterload profiles from the smart meter electricity trial dataset (SME subset) provided by the CERin Ireland [26]. For simplicity, the power factor for the official building load was assumed to0.95 lagging over the course of the full M time slots. The time step was set to 1 second fora 14 hour simulation conducted from 6am to 8pm. The load profile for the office buildingapplied in this time period is illustrated in Figure 3.18. Each data point of the load profilewas sampled and assumed to be constant during every half an hour.The maximum charge rate of each EV was set to 3.7kW which corresponds to a nominalcharging current of 16A. This means that when the EV charger is required to turn on, thecharge rate can only be set to 3.7kW. The assumptions on the SOC, and the travellingpatterns for EVs are consistent with the assumptions made in the previous section (i.e., forcomparisons of \u2019continuous\u2019 EV charging strategies). However, since we are now modellinga working scenario in which EVs will be charged in a SME area during the day, thus weshall assume that EVs depart for work between 7am and 10am and come back home between4pm and 7pm with the same probability distribution as specified in the previous section. Inaddition, we assume that in total 40 EVs connect, which represents 89% of available chargingpoints. Without loss of generality, in our simulation three EVs were assumed to alreadyconnect to the parking lot at the beginning of the simulation time (6am). This assumption canbe used to model some fixed number of EVs which are normally required to park overnightin the area (e.g. service vehicles).3.8 Comparisons of On-Off EV Charging Strategies 65Fig. 3.17 Schematic diagram of the distribution network6am 8am 10am 12pm 2pm 4pm 6pm 8pm100150200250300350Time(hours)Power(kW)Fig. 3.18 Office building power consumption from 6am to 8pm3.9 Discussion 663.8.2 Evaluation of On-Off Fairness based Charging StrategiesThe simulation results for the on-off charging strategies considered are also compared fromthe perspective of both the grid operators and customers. Power grid utilities wish to reducepower losses, voltage sag and maximize the energy that can be delivered to customers at alltimes. Hence, the power utilisation, the power losses in the cables and the voltage sag areinvestigated, see Figures 3.19 to 3.21. The results show that uncontrolled charging has asevere impact on the grid and could not be tolerated. The basic distributed charging strategyimproves the power network performance with regard to power losses and power utilisation.However, the voltage drop is still significant, as shown in Figure 3.21. By using the enhanceddistributed algorithm the minimum voltage is substantially improved. It is also noteworthythat the enhanced distributed strategy achieves comparable performance to the centralisedsolution throughout the simulation in terms of grid operation.From the customer side, performance is measured in terms of the quality of service thatis delivered. This depends on the amount of energy they receive or whether their EV is fullycharged before their departure. The best result in this regard is achieved by uncontrolledcharging, where all the EVs can finish charging within four hours. When using the enhancedor distributed algorithms all EVs were able to finish charging before departure. In termsof customer wishes, the centralised approach behaved worst with multiple EVs not fullycharged at their departure. As expected, the enhanced method is able to provide somefairness to the EVs. In other words, the centralised method provides the best solution fromthe grid perspective, but ignores fairness from the perspective of the customers. A detailedcomparison of the charging time for the EVs can be found in Table 3.5, including the averagecharging time and the extreme values.Therefore, the enhanced distributed on-off charging strategy can provide many benefitsto both utilities and customers. At the same time the required enhancements to the existingcharging infrastructure are small, as it requires only broadcast communication and measure-ment points at critical locations in the grid. Note that the results presented in this sectiondepend on the investigated power grid. The actual improvements possible can vary whenconsidering other grid structures and need to be investigated in detail.3.9 DiscussionIn general, uncontrolled charging provides the best performance in terms of its objective,i.e., minimising customer charging times. Similarly, by applying the basic AIMD, DPFand distributed on-off based charging strategies, charging fairness can be achieved for each3.9 Discussion 676am 8am 10am 12pm 2pm 4pm 6pm 8pm050100150Time(hours)Power(kW)  UncontrolledDistributedEnhanced distributedCentralisedAvailable powerFig. 3.19 Comparison of the power utilisation6am 8am 10am 12pm 2pm 4pm 6pm 8pm0123456Time(hours)Power losses(%)  UncontrolledDistributedEnhanced distributedCentralisedFig. 3.20 Comparison of the total power losses3.9 Discussion 68Table 3.5 A comparison of simulation results for various on-off type of EV charging strategies(50% EV penetration)Strategies Uncontrolled Distributeda Enhancedb CentralisedcAveTime(h)2.81 3.74 4.60 4.14StdTime(h)0.40 0.76 1.51 1.61MinTime(h)1.92 2.16 2.06 1.92MaxTime(h)3.59 4.90 7.43 7.79No.not finishedd0 0 0 2Missed(kWh)e0 0 0 5.65Earliest EV(h:m)f08:26 08:28 08:30 08:26Last EV(h:m)g13:15 14:33 17:42 n/aa Distributed on-off charging b Enhanced distributed on-off chargingc Centralised on-off charging d Number of EVs not fully chargede Remained energy to be charged to finish charging of all EVsf The earliest time that an EV finishes charging g The latest time that anEV finished chargingcustomer under appropriate assumptions, while the basic DPF method can adjust this fairnessaccording to the WTP specified by individual customers.However, typically these approaches violate grid constraints, as can be seen in Table3.1 and 3.5 and Figures 3.7 and 3.8. The addition of constraints allows the respectivecharging goals to be met while respecting grid constraints, as shown in Table 3.1 and 3.5and Figures 3.9\u20133.11 and Figures 3.19\u20133.21. While centralised algorithms achieve the bestperformance in terms of their stated goals, including satisfying power system constraints, theyrequire global information and also do not scale well, as mentioned previously. For example,here, the CLVM method has the longest simulation times. Decentralised algorithms, like theODVF algorithm, approach the performance of centralised algorithms and are scalable.Therefore the modified AIMD,DPF and distributed on-off algorithms show much promise.These algorithms provide a trade off between a small communication overhead and almostoptimal performance in terms of their grid objectives, and can be coordinated to approxi-3.10 Testbed Design 696am 8am 10am 12pm 2pm 4pm 6pm 8pm0.80.850.90.9511.05Time(hours)Voltage(p.u.)

The schematicdiagram of the project is illustrated in Figure 3.22. Here, the Arduino UNO [38] is acting asa central controller for computing and coordination. For the application at hand, we extendthe basic functions of the UNO by including charging and wireless modules. The chargingmodule is used to charge the phone battery and the wireless module is for packet transmission.In particular, we use the Zigbee protocol [47] for short distance communication betweendevices. However, for longer transmission range, this wireless module can be easily replacedby other available RF options or by enhancing the antennas. Finally, we use the oscilloscopefor demonstration and data logging. With these modules in place, the basic decentralisedAIMD algorithm can be applied on the testbed.3.10 Testbed Design 70According to the AIMD algorithm requirements, the wireless transmission system isdivided into two parts. We shall denote them as coordinator and router/end user separately.In practice, a coordinator can be regarded as an EV aggregator which provides availablepower and services for EV charging. The end users are normally regarded as the EV ownerswhich require EV charging services. In Figure 3.22 it is shown that there are two end usersand one coordinator. The coordinator is used to broadcast the capacity event signals to theend users. In our experiments, each capacity event signal is triggered manually by pressinga designated button connected to the coordinator. Note that this manual operation can bethought as in a practical scenario when more than two end users are charging simultaneously,where the condition of capacity events depends on the charging status of all end users and theuncertainty of the available power that can be provided. In this case, we can manually triggerthe capacity event signals in our design for easy implementations of the algorithm. The enduser is used to receive the packet from the coordinator. Each packet consists of one bit ofinformation for coding the capacity event. For instance, if an end user receives a \u20181\u2019 (i.e.rather than \u20180\u2019), it implies that a capacity event happened just now. On receiving each packet,each UNO (end user) decides whether to linearly increase or multiplicatively decrease thecharging current for the next time slot and forwarding this value to the charging module. Inthis way the charging current through each battery can be adjusted in a decentralised fashionby the AIMD algorithm via wireless coordination.The charging module is used to adjust the charging current based on the packet forwardedfrom the UNO (end user). This module is mainly composed of a MOSFET (PNP) and alimiting current component. The voltage applied on the MOSFET (gate) is used to controlthe current generated on the drain. The input voltage is generated from each UNO (enduser) and it is adjustable via the built-in PWM mechanisms. The limiting current componentis composed of a diode. The charging current can be measured directly by monitoring thevoltage across the resistance in parallel with the diode. Although the PWM signal can be usedto control charging current directly, we filter the PWM signal via a simple RC circuit suchthat the smoothed DC voltage can be clearly shown on the multimeter and the oscilloscope.With the data logging devices in place, the real-time data from the testbed can be exported.Figure 3.23 shows the comparisons of two filtered PWM signals from two different chargingboards. For observation purposes, the yellow curve is offset by 500mV to the blue curve. Inthis example, a series of capacity event signals were generated between 10 and 70 seconds.Although with a bit delay in wireless transmission between devices, the fairness of chargingis shown clearly. With respect to these PWM signals, Figure 3.24 demonstrates the changesin both charging voltage and current obtained from one battery. It is shown that the chargingcurrent reduces rapidly after receiving these capacity event signals, and it rises back (approx.)3.11 Conclusions 71linearly when the capacity events end. This illustrates that the basic AIMD algorithm hasbeen nicely implemented on our testbed. Further, it is also shown that the maximum chargingcurrent that can be provided by the board is 0.2A and the maximum charging voltage canbe adjusted to around 3.8V with respect to the open circuit voltage which equals 3.7V. Notethat the open circuit voltage can be observed when the charging current equals 0A at thebeginning of the charging process. This indicates that our battery is protected effectivelyfrom fast and overcharging. Note also that the maximum charging current of the experimentalbattery is 1.3A and the maximum charging voltage is 4.2V.USB CableSerial Port CommCapacity Event ControllerJump LineCoordinatorManual Input SignalRouter/End UserSerial Port CommCharger Controller Jump LineCharge LineOscilloscope Cable Router/End UserSerial Port CommCharger Controller Jump LineCharge LineOscilloscope Cable Fig. 3.22 Schematic diagram for the hardware testbed3.11 ConclusionsIn this chapter, we considered a wide variety of EV charging strategies applied in low-voltagedistribution networks. To commence the chapter, we have presented a comprehensive reviewof the literature for charging a fleet of EVs by using different coordination strategies. Ourstarting point is the observation that with all of these charging strategies available, thereis no common framework such that the performance of these strategies can be compared.Motivated by this, a mathematical framework for formulating EV charging problems has been3.11 Conclusions 72Fig. 3.23 Comparisons of charging fairness on the testbed0 20 40 60 80 10000.050.10.150.20.25Time(second)Current(A)0 20 40 60 80 1003.73.723.743.763.783.83.82Time(second)Voltage(V)Fig. 3.24 Charging current and voltage of the first battery3.11 Conclusions 73presented that incorporates both power system and charging infrastructure constraints andcaters for both instantaneous and temporal optimisation objectives. Within this framework,several typical charging strategies were evaluated. These algorithms were further tested on apower system distribution level testbed in both residential and SME scenarios using a hybridMatlab/OpenDSS platform, and using realistic demand and charging profiles.To conclude, we give an overall assessment for each approach considered in this chap-ter. It was found that those algorithms that ignored system constraints, i.e., Uncontrolled,AIMD, AIMD(P), DPF, DPF(P) and distributed on-off, typically violated them for largeEV penetrations and thus not suitable for practical implementations. Of the algorithmsthat considered power system constraints, the modified AIMD, DPF and distributed on-offalgorithms provided the best trade off in terms of achieving almost optimal performance interms of their grid objectives while satisfying constraints and maintaining a small commu-nication overhead are most recommended for practical implementations. While for othercommunication based optimal algorithms considered, i.e. ICIC, ICIC(P), CLVM, DSC andCCCM, are not scalable well and usually require global information for decision making,and thus they are not suggested for practical implementations.Chapter 4Using V2G for Ancillary ServicesAbstract: This chapter discusses different V2G schemes for providing ancillary servicesto the grid. In particular, two applications involving groups of EVs are investigated: (1)mitigating the current imbalance in a typical three-phase power network; and (2) providingoptimal fairness power dispatch in a microgrid scenario. The research which is joint workwith Emanuele Crisostomi, Se\u00e1n McLoone, and Robert Shorten was published in [105, 111].4.1 IntroductionThe previous chapter evaluated various strategies for coordinating the charging of EVs andhow they impacted on the grid. In all cases the focus was on controlling the power flow fromthe Grid-to-Vehicle (G2V). Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) opportunities were not explored.In this chapter we shall investigate applying different V2G technologies on a group ofEVs to provide ancillary services to the grid. In this regard, we consider two applications.In the first application, we harness the power of V2G to reduce the current imbalance ona three-phase distribution network. Current and voltage imbalance are intrinsically linked,however, the issue of balancing currents is less complex than that of balancing voltages.This is because the current magnitudes and angles along phases can easily be measured atthe transformer, and current demand can then potentially be altered to balance phases. Thevoltage on the other hand is related to the distribution of individual loads along the phases,and it is more difficult to determine where the controllable loads, e.g. EVs, are located. Inthe case of current balancing, it is more advantageous to use a distributed algorithm ratherthan a centralised solution because global knowledge of the system may not be available to acentralised controller, and a distributed approach allows flexibility in terms of what EVs arecontrolled at a given time, i.e., it allows a more \u201cplug and play\u201d type approach. With this inmind, a distributed EV charging strategy, based on techniques from the cooperative control4.1 Introduction 75literature, is developed. To date, many cooperative control algorithms have been employed inpower system applications [74, 215], and our work uses the distributed consensus methoddeveloped in [94] (Note that this method is based on Lemma 4.1 of Chapter 4 [94] and istheoretically the same as Lemma 2 of Chapter 2 of this thesis). The proposed solution seeksto regulate EV charging in order to prevent overloading of the grid, while at the same timecoordinating charging/discharging activity across phases so as to reduce current imbalanceand power losses.In the second application, we study the power dispatch problem in a microgrid scenariowith EVs and renewable energy generation. In this scenario, EVs are connected to the gridand managed by an aggregator such that EV owners can sell their own energy to the grid whenthey do not need to travel, and the power grid can store energy by charging the EVs if it isrequired. This framework is attractive for all participants since EV owners see in this processthe possibility of earning money by selling V2G services, and the grid company see in thisprocess the feasibility of regulating the fluctuating energy produced from renewable sourcesor to improve grid stability at critical times. On this basis, we model the V2G problem as anoptimisation problem that aims to achieve an optimal trade-off between the economic benefitof using energy from renewables instead of energy from other more expensive power plants,and the inconveniences caused to the owner in terms of residual energy remaining in the EV.Also, we are interested in computing a \u201cfair\u201d solution, where fairness is related to the factthat the same energy should be taken from all EVs participating in the V2G programme (i.e.some EVs\u2019 owners might decide not to participate in such a programme to preserve the levelof energy in their EVs for future use).Note that the challenge with such an optimisation problem is that the utility functionsassociated with each EV are personal, and should not be revealed to others. Also, we areinterested in computing the optimal solution in a distributed fashion, to avoid increasingcomputation load on the central infrastructure (e.g. base stations) and to improve flexibility,privacy and robustness from a system perspective. We shall illustrate a distributed consensusalgorithm that solves this V2G problem in a fair manner, trying to achieve an optimal trade-off between power generation costs and inconvenience to the vehicle owner. Note that ourproposed solution is largely based on the results obtained in Chapter 2.The remainder of the chapter is organised as follows. In Section 4.2, the applicationof V2G to current imbalance reduction is presented. In Section 4.3, the V2G problem isformulated and the proposed algorithm is applied to achieve optimal V2G power dispatch ina microgrid. Section 4.4 concludes the chapter.4.2 Current Imbalance Reduction 764.2 Current Imbalance Reduction4.2.1 Current Unbalance FactorThe Voltage Unbalance Factor (VUF) is proposed as a metric for quantifying the degree ofvoltage imbalance in a network. To date, there have been many different definitions proposedfor VUF, such as the IEEE and NEMA standards [129, 154]. However, in practice VUF isnot always sufficient for a complete analysis of the power network. In this regard, Standardsfor the Current Unbalance Factor (SCUF) are proposed, which help to calculate the VUFand support better understanding of the power grid. In this chapter it is assumed that themaximum acceptable SCUF on the grid is 10% [51]. The SCUF is given as follows [156]:%SCUF = (|in |\f\f\fip\f\f\f )\u00d7100%, (4.1)where in and ip are the negative sequence and positive sequence components of the current i.If we denote the zero sequence current as i0, and the current in the individual phases as ia, ib,and ic then: \uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0i0ipin\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb=13\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f01 1 11 \u03b1 \u03b121 \u03b12 \u03b1\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0iaibic\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb, (4.2)where \u03b1 is defined as follows:\u03b1 = e j23 \u03c0 . (4.3)With (4.2), we can easily calculate the current unbalance factor using the measuredcurrent on each phase.4.2.2 Current Balance EquationThe current balance equation can be formulated in a general framework by considering theEV charging loads on each phase [51]. The balance equations are given as follows:in = inr+ inii,ip = ipr+ ipii,(4.4)4.2 Current Imbalance Reduction 77whereipr = 13 (id1+ id2+ id3)ipi = \u221213(iq1+ iq2+ iq3)inr = 13id1\u2212 16 (id2+ id3)+\u221a36(iq2\u2212 iq3)ini = 13iq1\u2212 16(iq2+ iq3)\u2212\u221a36 (id2\u2212 id3)(4.5)and also with:\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0id1id2id3\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb=\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0PL1+PEV1Vs1PL2+PEV2Vs2PL3+PEV3Vs3\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb,\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0iq1iq2iq3\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb=\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0QL1+QEV1Vs1QL2+QEV2Vs2QL3+QEV3Vs3\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb. (4.6)In (4.6), the variables PEV j and QEV j denote the total active and reactive powers consumedby the EV loads on the j th phase. Similarly, the variables PL j and QL j are used to representthe total active and reactive powers consumed by all household loads on the j th phase. Inaddition, Vs j is used to represent the voltage at the transformer on the j th phase. In (4.4), inrand ini denote the real and imaginary components of the negative sequence current. Similarly,ipr and ipi are used to represent the real and imaginary components of the positive sequencecurrent. In (4.5), id j and iq j represent the in-phase and quadrature component on the j th phaseof current i. It is worth noting that in a balanced system, zero sequence component i0 shouldalways equals to zero. Since the zero sequence component is not related to the SCUF definedin (4.1), this expression is not considered in the context of this chapter.According to the definition in (4.1), the SCUF can be set to 0 if the value of in can bemanipulated to 0. With this in mind, referring to (4.5), if the following holds:id1 = id2 = id3 > 0 (4.7)iq1 = iq2 = iq3 = 0 (4.8)then both inr and ini will be equal to 0 while ip will still be a positive value. Therefore,|in | =\u221ainr2+ ini2 will be 0. Referring to (4.6), the active power flow on each phase canbe made the same via manipulation of PEV j , for j = 1,2,3 (ignoring the small differencesbetween phase voltages at the head of transformer Vs), so as to satisfy (4.7), and (4.8) issatisfied by letting:QL j = \u2212QEV j, for j = 1,2,3. (4.9)It is possible to achieve this goal using a V2G framework where each EV has theflexibility to adjust their charge rates as required [170]. Based on this idea, a distributedcontrol framework can be designed as in the following section.4.2 Current Imbalance Reduction 784.2.3 Distributed Consensus AlgorithmLet us consider a scenario in which there are N number of EVs connected to the grid. It isassumed that each EV charger has a maximum allowable apparent power simax, a maximumactive power draw, cimax, and a maximum reactive power draw, rimax, such that:simax =\u221acimax2+ r imax2. (4.10)The load power consumption in the network is discretised, with a sample time \u2206T . Themeasured active and reactive power consumptions on the j th phase of the transformer atsample step k are denoted by T ja (k) and Tjr (k), respectively. The index set of all EVsconnected at the j th phase at sample step k is denoted by \u0398 j (k). To protect the transmissionline from overloading, the maximum power flow that can be tolerated at each phase is definedas Pmax. The active and reactive charge rates for the ith EV at sample step k are denotedby ci (k) and ri (k), respectively. Here, ri (k) > 0, such that the ith EV can inject the sameamount of reactive power as the reactive power consumed by the houses. The variablesG ja(k) and Gjr (k), which denote the total chargeable capacity of active and reactive powerson the j th phase, are given as follows:G ja(k) =\u2211i\u2208\u0398 j (k)(cimax\u2212 ci (k)), for j = 1,2,3,G jr (k) =\u2211i\u2208\u0398 j (k)(r imax\u2212 ri (k)), for j = 1,2,3.(4.11)Now the result in Lemma 2 can be applied to the EV charging strategy outlined above.Lemma 2 Let {P(k)}k\u2208N be a sequence of row stochastic matrices which is strongly ergodic.Then for every solution {x(k)}k\u2208N of (2.22) we havelimk\u2192\u221edist (x(k),E) = 0 . (4.12)To apply the above Lemma we proceed as follows. For each k we define the P (k) asPi\u02dc, j\u02dc (k) =\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f31\u2212\u2211 j\u02dc\u2208N i\u02dck\u03b7 j\u02dc, if j\u02dc = i\u02dc,\u03b7 j\u02dc, if j\u02dc \u2208 N i\u02dck,0, otherwise., (4.13)where i\u02dc, j\u02dc are the indices of the entries of the matrix P (k), \u03b7 j\u02dc \u2208 R is a weighting factor,and N i\u02dck represents the set of neighbour agents communicating to the ith EV. For example, aconvenient choice for \u03b7 j\u02dc can be1\f\f\fN i\u02dck \f\f\f+1 \u2208(0, 1N\u22121), where |\u2022| denotes cardinality, giving riseto an equal weight factor for all elements in x(k). This leads to the following distributedconsensus algorithm for the charging of EVs on the individual phases:4.2 Current Imbalance Reduction 79Algorithm 5 Distributed Consensus Algorithm1: while Battery not charged do2: for each i \u2208 \u0398 j (k) do3: Get E ja (k) from the server at the main transformer.4: Get ch(k) from all neighbours h \u2208 N ik .5: Do \u03b4i (k) = \u03b7ia\u2211h\u2208N ik(ch(k)\u2212 ci (k))+ \u00b5a .E ja (k).6: Do ci (k +1) = min(cimax,ci (k)+ \u03b4i (k)).7: end for8: end while9:10: while Charger is active do11: for each i \u2208 \u0398 j (k) do12: Get E jr (k) from the server at the main transformer.13: Get rh(k) from all neighbours h \u2208 N ik .14: Do \u03bbi (k) = \u03b7ir\u2211h\u2208N ik(rh(k)\u2212 ri (k))+ \u00b5r .E jr (k).15: Do ri (k +1) = min(r imax,ri (k)+ \u03bbi (k)).16: end for17: end whileComment: As an example to illustrate the matrix P(k), let us consider a simple networkwith three EVs at a given time step k. We assume the followings: the first EV is able toreceive the info only from the second EV; the second EV is not able to receive any info fromits neighbours; the third EV is able to receive info from all EVs; then the correspondingmatrix P(k) can be shaped as:P(k) =\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f01212 00 1 0131313\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fbThe variables \u03b7ia and \u03b7ir are weighting factors of the ith EV determining the convergencerate for active and reactive power and \u00b5a and \u00b5r affect the stability of the algorithm. With aproper choice of parameters, consensus will be approximately achieved (due to numericalquantisation) for the both active and reactive charge rates for each EV connected on the samephase. The variable E ja (k) is the difference between the allowable power on phase j and thecurrent power being drawn on phase j. Effectively this is the amount of extra power that canbe absorbed by the available EVs along each phase j. A similar definition applies to E ja (k)as regards the reactive power, where it is only required to compensate for the reactive powerconsumed on each phase j by the household loads.4.2 Current Imbalance Reduction 80Fig. 4.1 Schematic diagram of the communication topologyTo apply this theory, it is also assumed that each EV has the ability to exchange informa-tion about its charge rate with its connected neighbours. This constructed communicationgraph can be time-varying (e.g. due to uncertain communication issues) and it is assumedthat this communication always exist unless only one or zero EVs are in the network. Beyondthat, it is also required that each EV has the ability to receive a broadcast signal from thetransformer. This signal is used to coordinate the charge rates of EVs and achieve somecommon goal (e.g. current balancing). A schematic diagram for the required communicationtopology is illustrated in Figure 4.1.It should be noted that, for the algorithm presented here, it is not necessarily requiredto know the number of connected EVs at each time slot. The values of G ja(k) and Gjr (k) in(4.11) are communicated in a similar fashion to the charge rates, but the result is accumulatedas it is transmitted along the communication nodes. In practice, this process is performedbefore the broadcast signals are updated each time step on the transformer side. It is alsorequired that at least one of the EVs connected to the j th phase is able to send the G ja(k) andG jr (k) signals back to the transformer.It is then necessary for the transformer to recalculate both the reactive power required forcompensation at each sample step, and also the active power charge rates required for themaximisation of EV charging whilst maintaining balanced phases. To this end, the signals4.2 Current Imbalance Reduction 81related to the active, E ja (k), and reactive power, Ejr (k), broadcast from the transformer toeach EV connected to the j th phase, are formulated as follows:P jtot(k) = min(Pmax,Gja(k)+Tja (k)),Pmin(k) = min(P1tot(k),P2tot(k),P3tot(k)),E ja (k) = Pmin(k)\u2212T ja (k),E jr (k) = min(G jr (k),Tjr (k)).(4.14)Here P jtot(k) is the total potential power that could be drawn by phase j at sample stepk. The variable Pmin(k) is defined as the minimum of the Pjtot(k) values that can be drawnamongst the three phases at sample step k. This is then the setpoint for the total power to bedrawn in each of the individual phases. The allowable power to be drawn in phase j, E ja (k),is then given by the difference between the total power phase j can draw and the currentpower being drawn in phase j. The reactive power, E jr (k), is chosen on each phase to equalthe reactive power being drawn by household loads at sample step k.4.2.4 SimulationsIn this section a distribution level simulation is developed. We adopted a similar topology toa distribution network modelled in Section 3.8.1.As illustrated in Figure 4.2, a 10kV/400V(400kVA) \u2206/Y (grounded) transformer wasconnected at the head of the feeder. The voltage from the external grid was set to 1.05pu. Thedistribution network was modelled with the TN-C-S earthing system, where the three-phasetransmission line was split clearly with a neutral line connected back to the neutral point.The variable Z denotes the total power consumption at the location to which it is connected,which includes both household loads and EV charging loads. Each load Z was modelled asa constant current load and each household load was associated with a power factor. Forsimplicity, we assumed this factor was equal to 0.95 lagging for each house during the day.The load profile for each house was randomly chosen from the dataset given in [26]. Theneach load profile was resampled every minute such that the load consumption was constantwithin each one minute interval. In addition, the sampling time for the charging algorithmwas set to one second. In other words, it was assumed that each EV was able to finishexchanging charge rate information with their neighbours in this one second interval.It was assumed that there were 20 houses located evenly on each phase. The distancebetween each house was 10 meters. The power limit Pmax for each phase line was definedas 80kW. The maximum apparent power simax for ith EV was set to 4kW, and the maximumactive charge rate cimax was set to 3.7kW. Thus, the maximum reactive charge rate rimax was4.2 Current Imbalance Reduction 82Fig. 4.2 Schematic diagram of the distribution network.calculated as 1.52kvar, which corresponds to a maximum of 6.6A quadrature componentof charging current under a nominal single phase voltage of 230V. The battery capacity foreach EV was assumed to be 20kWh and the initial energy required by each EV was normallydistributed with a mean of 10kWh and a standard deviation of 1.5kWh. EV arrival timeswere also based on a normal time distribution with mean 6pm and a standard deviation of 1hour, and EVs left between 7am and 10am with the following time distribution: 7am-8am(21%), 8am-9am (47%) and 9am-10am (32%) based on [36]. These consumption patternsare consistent with the assumptions made in Section 3.7.4.2.5 Results and DiscussionTo demonstrate the algorithm, a simple Matlab based simulation was devised. In thissimulation 10 EVs are connected to each phase and each was given a random initial chargerate. The maximum number of sample steps was set to 100. In this example, we assume thatEVs only sought to balance the active power flow on each phase. At the initial time step, thetotal measured power flow on each phase was 50kW, 40kW and 60kW in phases 1, 2 and 3,respectively, and the maximum active charge rate for each EV was 4kW. The simulation wasrun and the results are given in Figures 4.3-4.6.The results show that the EVs on each phase coordinate their actions and achieve consen-sus on their charge rates within 50 time steps. By adjusting \u03b7, the convergence speed can bemade faster, as illustrated in Figure 4.4. On the other hand, it is also shown that improperselection of \u00b5, can result in instability, as illustrated in Figure 4.6. Therefore, a suitablechoice of both parameters is essential to maintain stable and fast control of the system [94].4.2 Current Imbalance Reduction 830 20 40 60 80 10000.511.522.533.54Time step kCharge rates(kW)Fig. 4.3 Active charge rates for EVs connected to phase one with \u03b7 = 0.5 and \u00b5 = 0.01.0 20 40 60 80 10000.511.522.533.54Time step kCharge rates(kW)Fig. 4.4 Active charge rates for EVs connected to phase one with \u03b7 = 0.8 and \u00b5 = 0.01.4.2 Current Imbalance Reduction 840 20 40 60 80 100505560657075Time step kActive power flow on each Phase(kW)  Phase1Phase2Phase3ExpectedFig. 4.5 Total power consumptions on each phase compared with desired result with \u03b7 = 0.5and \u00b5 = 0.01.0 20 40 60 80 100505560657075Time step kActive power flow on each Phase(kW)  Phase1Phase2Phase3StableFig. 4.6 Active charge rates for EVs connected to phase one with \u03b7 = 0.5 and \u00b5 = 0.2.4.2 Current Imbalance Reduction 8512pm 4pm 8pm 12am 4am 8am 12pm0102030405060708090Time(hour)Power(kW)  Phase1Phase2Phase3Start regulationCharging finishedFig. 4.7 Active power consumption on each phase with distributed consensus algorithm.12pm 4pm 8pm 12am 4am 8am 12pm\u22122024681012Time(hour)Reactive power(kVar)  Phase1Phase2Phase3Start regulation EVs plug outFig. 4.8 Reactive power consumption on each phase with distributed consensus algorithm.4.2 Current Imbalance Reduction 8612pm 4pm 8pm 12am 4am 8am 12pm02468101214Time(hour)Current unbalance factor (%)  No EVWith EVsCharging finished EVs plug outStart regulationFig. 4.9 Comparison of current balance factor12pm 4pm 8pm 12am 4am 8am 12pm05101520253035404550Time(hour)Neutral current (A)  No EVWith EVsStart regulationEVs plug outCharging finishedFig. 4.10 Comparison of neutral current magnitude4.3 Optimal V2G Power Dispatch 87The results for the power system simulations are illustrated in Figures 4.7-4.10. It canbe seen in Figures 4.7 and 4.8 that by using the distributed consensus technique both activepower and reactive power consumptions were balanced on each phase. The active powerflow is well balanced until around 10pm, when most of the EVs have finished charging. Thereactive power remains balanced while most of the EVs remain plugged in. As a result, theneutral current and current unbalance factor were minimised during EV charging times (theSCUF is almost zero in this case). While the EVs are connected both the active and reactivepowers are well balanced as desired across the 3 phases. This is dependent on there beingcritical levels of EVs in place on the grid. Outside of the times when there are critical levelsof EV penetration on the grid, it may not be possible to provide active power phase balancingusing the available EVs alone. Thus, it may also be necessary to have other sources whichcould provide this ancillary service.4.3 Optimal V2G Power Dispatch4.3.1 Model and AlgorithmIn this section we consider a scenario in which a number of EVs are plugged-in in alarge parking lot (e.g., a parking lot in a city airport) in a microgrid. Some of these EVsdecide to participate in a V2G programme: during their parking period, they can be dis-charged/recharged within some given limits in order to improve the economic operation ofthe grid. The EVs participate on the basis of getting a financial reward. The discharge shouldthus occur in a fair way to avoid having some EVs getting more money than others.The EVs are coordinated by an EV aggregator in the microgrid. In this scenario, theoptimal power discharge rate is computed by taking into account economic factors and someQuality of Service (QoS) to customers. We assume that the grid will charge the EV batterieswith excess energy produced from renewable sources in the microgrid. This implies that inthe future, when needed, the grid will consider the possibility of taking energy from EVsback to the grid if the load exceeds the energy currently produced from renewables (e.g.,peak-time hours). Without EVs connected, the grid would have to use the power generatedfrom conventional sources, thus incurring high generation costs (e.g., fuel consumptioncosts) and increased harmful pollution (e.g., CO and NOx). Thus, the economic benefit ofusing EVs relies on recovering energy from the EVs rather than producing new energy fromconventional plant. The QoS aspect of the utility functions takes into account the concerns ofEV owners with regard to having a reduced mobility range if too much energy is taken fromtheir EV batteries.4.3 Optimal V2G Power Dispatch 88We mathematically formulate the previous problem as follows. Let N denote the maxi-mum number of EVs participating into the scheme. Define the set N := {1,2, ...,N } as theindex set for all EVs and the set \u03a6(k) as the index set for the EVs available at time k, i.e., theEVs with enough SOC to participate in discharge cycles in the scheme. Let |\u03a6(k) | denote thenumber of elements in the set \u03a6(k). Let ci (k) denote the discharge rate of the ith EV in set N.Further, let cimax represent the maximum discharge rate that can be injected to the grid. Bothvalues are assumed to be positive in the V2G mode. The corresponding discharge rate vectorfor all EVs at time k is defined as c(k)T := [c1(k),c2(k), ...,cN (k)]. In our study, V2G powerdispatch to the grid is discretised into M time slots (indexed as 1,2,...,M) each of length \u2206T .Each EV connects to the grid during a certain time slot, which is represented by the range[ai,bi]. Due to technical diversity of batteries and chargers, each EV may have a differentbattery capacity (kWh) and a different energy transferring efficiency. The parameters forboth factors are denoted as Bi and \u03b7i respectively. Furthermore, to protect the EVs fromover-discharging, the minimum SOC for the ith EV is defined as SOCimin. This parameterdefines the drop out criteria for the EV. Thus, if SOCi (k) \u2264 SOCimin, then ci (k) = 0. Finally,given the initial V2G regulation time k0, the SOC for the ith EV at time k is given by:SOCi (k) = SOCi (k0)\u2212k\u22121\u2211j=k0ci ( j) \u00b7\u2206TBi, \u2200i \u2208 N (4.15)4.3.2 Utility FunctionsIn addition to the basic model parameters, each EV i is also associated with a utility functionfi :R 7\u2192R, which models both economic and QoS factors associated with the energy deliveredfrom the ith EV. This function will be modelled as a convex function arising from combiningthe two terms. In addition, we will denote the first derivative of the utility function fi as f \u2032i .Now we model the utility functions in detail. As already mentioned, each function fi iscomposed of two different terms that take into account the economic and the QoS aspects,respectively. A diagram is illustrated in Figure 4.11 demonstrating the basic function relationof both terms related to the EV discharge rate.Note that in Figure 4.11 the notation fe and fq refer to the economic term and the incon-venience term of discharge rate (i.e., ci (k)) respectively. The maximum discharge rate isassumed to be 4kW corresponding to the parameter cimax in the model. According to thisdiagram, the economic term fe implies that the less energy delivered from EVs, the greaterexpense for the grid due to the need to employ more expensive power generation, e.g.,conventional power plants. In fact, power generation costs in the literature are typicallymodelled as a quadratic function of the energy produced in a unit of time [7, 207].

With this idea, we approximately model theoverall utility function taking account of both terms as a quadratic function. Considering thevariation in the inconvenience term among users, we perturbed each function with a factoraccording to the SOC of each EV. To this end, the overall expression of the utility function ofthe ith EV is modelled as follows:fi (ci (k)) = f iq(ci (k))+ fie(ci (k)) = \u03b1i \u00b7 ci (k)2+ \u03b2i \u00b7 ci (k)+[1\u2212(SOCi (k0)\u2212 SOCimin)]\u00b7 ci (k)+\u03b3i, \u2200i \u2208 \u03a6(k).(4.16)Comment: In (4.16), parameters \u03b1i, \u03b2i and \u03b3i refer to the pricing function adopted by the gridto give revenues to the EVs participating to the programme. Each perturbed function fi is asso-ciated with an increasing affine function with positive parameter[1\u2212(SOCi (k0)\u2212 SOCimin)].Thus, the closer an EV is to its safety level of energy SOCimin required to get back home,the greater the inconvenience to the owner. In practice, the EV owners can indicate a biggerSOCimin than the one truly needed, if they are particularly anxious to have enough energyfor their next journey. In addition, they can always set the parameter SOCimin to 1 to beautomatically excluded from the V2G programme.4.3 Optimal V2G Power Dispatch 90Now the overall optimisation problem can be defined as follows:minc(k)\u2211i\u2208\u03a6(k)fi (ci (k))subject to:\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3ci (k) = c j (k), \u2200i , j \u2208 \u03a6(k)0 \u2264 ci (k) \u2264 cimaxSOCimin \u2264 SOCi (k) \u2264 1(4.17)4.3.3 Optimal SolutionIn this section, we show how to apply the previous results in Chapter 2 to solve a class ofoptimisation problem1 similar to the form of (4.17).For a general model setup, we consider a scenario in which there are N vehicles connectedin a network through communication links and let N denote the set {1,2, ...,N } for indexingthe vehicles. We assume that each vehicle is able to receive/transmit messages from/to eithernearby vehicles or available centralised infrastructure (e.g. base station). We assume thateach vehicle can communicate a limited amount of information with the infrastructure, andthat the infrastructure can broadcast information to the entire network of vehicles, and eachvehicle can send a broadcast signal to its neighbours.    Network of vehiclesMeasurement of  global valuesFeedback ofglobal valuesBase stationVehiclesFig. 4.12 Schematic diagram of the optimisation framework [94]1The proposed solution presented in this section can also be used to solve other similar problems in differentscenarios (e.g. intelligent transportation scenarios in Chapters 6 and 7).4.3 Optimal V2G Power Dispatch 91The problem we wish to solve is to find an optimal consensus point satisfying x\u2217 = y\u2217esuch that the following optimisation problem is solved:minx\u2208RNN\u2211i=1fi (xi)subject to: xi = x j, \u2200i , j \u2208 N .(4.18)We wish to use an iterative feedback scheme of the form (2.22) to solve the optimisationproblem (4.18). We will require that (4.18) has a unique solution and derive the specificform for function G in (2.22) from first order optimality conditions. To this end, it followsfrom elementary optimisation theory that when the fi\u2019s are strictly convex, the optimisationproblem (4.18) will be solved if and only if there exists a unique y\u2217 \u2208 R satisfyingN\u2211i=1f \u2032i (y\u2217) = 0, (4.19)where f \u2032 denotes the first derivative of the utility function f . With this in mind we apply afeedback signalG(x) = \u2212\u00b5N\u2211i=1f \u2032i (xi) (4.20)where \u00b5 \u2208 R is a parameter to be determined. This gives rise to the following dynamicalsystemx(k +1) = P(k)x(k)\u2212 \u00b5N\u2211i=1f \u2032i (xi (k))e (4.21)where we assume that the sequence {P(k)}k\u2208N satisfies the conditions of uniform strongergodicity as specified in Section 2.2, and recalling that e \u2208 RN is a vector with all entriesequal to 1. As we assume that the fi are strictly convex, their derivatives are strictly increasing.We assume that each f \u2032i has a strictly positive and bounded growth, i.e., there exist constantsdimin and dimax; such that for any a , b0 < dimin \u2264f \u2032i (a)\u2212 f \u2032i (b)a\u2212 b \u2264 dimax \u2200i \u2208 N. (4.22)We claim that provided \u00b5 is chosen according to0 < \u00b5 < 2*,N\u2211i=1dimax+-\u22121(4.23)4.3 Optimal V2G Power Dispatch 92then (4.21) is uniformly globally asymptotically stable at the unique optimal point x\u2217e of theoptimisation problem (4.18). First, we consider the scalar system of (4.21) which is given byy(k +1) = y(k)\u2212 \u00b5N\u2211i=1f \u2032i (y(k)). (4.24)Note first that the fixed point condition for (4.24) is\u2211Ni=1 f\u2032i (y\u2217) = 0. So that a fixed pointy\u2217 of (4.24), gives rise, by Lemma 1 to a fixed point of (4.21), which satisfies the necessaryand sufficient conditions for optimality (4.19). Now, we wish to use Theorem 6 to showglobal asymptotic stability. To this end, we need to verify the system (4.21) satisfies allthe conditions required in Theorem 6. The condition (4.23) ensures in fact that the righthand side of (4.24) is in fact a strict contraction on R. It follows from our comments afterLemma 5 that the assumption (ii) of Lemma 5 is satisfied. To show the Lipschitz condition(i) note that by (4.22) each f \u2032i is globally Lipschitz. As the coordinate functions are globallyLipschitz and sums of globally Lipschitz functions retain that property we obtain condition(ii).For completeness, we formally state the above arguments as a theorem. In Theorem 9,we refer to a one-dimensional Lure system (2.23) associated to (2.22). The Lure system isused to demonstrate the stability of system (2.22).Theorem 9 ([94, 115]) Consider the optimisation problem (4.18), the optimisation algo-rithm (2.22), and the associated Lure system (2.23). If G is defined by (4.20) and thecondition (4.23) holds, then the following assertions hold:(i) There exists a unique, globally asymptotically stable fixed point y\u2217 \u2208 R of the Luresystem (2.23).(ii) The fixed point y\u2217 of (i) satisfies the optimality condition (4.19) and thus y\u2217e \u2208 RNis the unique optimal point for the optimisation problem (4.18).(iii) If, in addition, {P (k)}k\u2208N \u2282 RN\u00d7N is a strongly ergodic sequence of row-stochasticmatrices, then y\u2217e is a globally asymptotically stable fixed point for system (2.22).4.3.4 Optimal Decentralised Consensus Algorithm for V2GWe now describe an optimal decentralised consensus (ODC) algorithm that is consistent withTheorem 9 and applies to the practical scenario of interest. The Algorithm 6 follows fromthe principles defined in Theorem 9 and takes into account practical grid constraints.4.3 Optimal V2G Power Dispatch 93For practical implementations of the algorithm, we assume that each EV is able toreceive/transmit messages from/to either nearby EVs or available infrastructure (e.g. a basestation provided by the aggregator) via a specific communication device (e.g. a mobile phonewith access to WiFi/3G networks) facilitated on the EV. In addition, we assume that eachEV i can communicate f \u2032i (ci (k)) with the infrastructure at every time step k, and that theinfrastructure can broadcast the feedback signal\u2211j\u2208\u03a6(k)f \u2032j (c j (k)) to the entire network of EVs,and each EV i can send a broadcast signal ci (k) to its nearby EVs at every time step k.In Algorithm 6, N ik represents the set of neighbours of the ith EV at time k, satisfyingN ik \u2282 \u03a6(k), which can send their discharge rate signals to the ith EV. We assume that thecommunications among EVs subject to a variety of distributions such that the correspondinggraphs for EV connections are time-varying. However, we require that the communicationgraphs for EVs are strongly connected at most time instances. Note that this assumption holdsif there are sufficient EVs parking in a given area in the airport. To this end, we adopt thesame definition of P(k) as specified in (4.13) for modelling the time-varying communicationtopology of the connected EVs. For convergence of the algorithm, the parameter \u00b5 is chosenin the range defined in (4.23) and \u03b7i is chosen in (0, 1N\u22121 ).4.3.5 SimulationsTo evaluate the performance of the proposed ODC algorithm in a realistic microgrid scenario,a specific microgrid model was constructed through the OpenDSS simulation platform. Aschematic diagram is illustrated in Figure 4.14 to demonstrate the structure of the microgrid.The power topology diagram of this microgrid is shown in Figure 4.13. In the simulation,we assumed that several Distributed Generators (DGs) were installed in the Medium-Voltage(MV) network with voltage level equal to 10kV. This network included three wind plants,two Photovoltaic (PV) plants and one Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant. The DGsassociated with the V2G power inverted from EV batteries are connected through three phase400V/10kV step-up transformers to the MV network. The DGs were modelled as constantP-Q generators with the same power factor (i.e., 1.0) to generate pure active power for theloads. The capacity of the wind plants, the PV plants and the CHP were chosen as 600kW,184kW and 800kW. The maximum wind power output for each wind DG was randomlychosen from real wind turbine data according to [141]. In addition, the maximum solarpower generation profile of each PV was computed according to a quadratic function withnon-zero values from 6am to 6pm, randomly perturbed to simulate cloud disturbances, asin [4]. We assumed that total demand in the microgrid was composed of 20 basic loads4.3 Optimal V2G Power Dispatch 94Algorithm 6 Optimal Decentralised Consensus algorithm for V2G1: for k = k0, k0+1, k0+2, .. do2: if k = k0 then3: Initialise c(k) = 04: Determine the set of available EVs \u03a6(k)5: Each EV i evaluates f \u2032i (ci (k))6: else7: for each i \u2208 N do8: SOCi (k) = SOCi (k \u22121)\u2212 ci (k \u22121) \u00b7 \u2206TBi9: if ai \u2264 k < bi then10: if SOCi (k) \u2264 SOCimin then11: \u03a6(k) \u2190 \u03a6(k \u22121)\u2212 {i}12: ci (k) = 013: else14: \u03a6(k) \u2190 \u03a6(k \u22121)+ {i}15: end if16: else17: \u03a6(k) \u2190 \u03a6(k \u22121)\u2212 {i}18: ci (k) = 019: end if20: end for21:22: for each i \u2208 \u03a6(k) do23: Get c j (k \u22121) from all neighbours j \u2208 N ik\u22121.24: Get F\u02dc (k \u22121) = \u2211j\u2208\u03a6(k)f \u2032j (c j (k \u22121)) from the base station.25: Do qi (k \u22121) = \u03b7i\u2211 j\u2208N ik\u22121(c j (k \u22121)\u2212 ci (k \u22121)).26: Do ci (k) = min(cimax,ci (k \u22121)+ qi (k \u22121)\u2212 \u00b5 \u00b7 F\u02dc (k \u22121))27: end for28: end if29: end for4.3 Optimal V2G Power Dispatch 95Fig. 4.13 Power topology of the microgrid network.EMSAggregatorDemand DGsPower FlowPower FlowPower FlowInfo FlowInfo flowInfo flowEVN\u2026\u2026V2G PowerInfo flowEV1 EV2 EViMicrogridExternalGridInfo Flow Power FlowInfo flowInfo flowInfo flowFig. 4.14 Schematic diagram of the microgrid4.3 Optimal V2G Power Dispatch 96connected randomly in the load area, each of which had the nominal power consumption of100kW. The load profiles were randomly chosen for a period of 24 hours according to [165].Although microgrids can be also operated in island mode, we assumed in our examplethat it could still exchange a bidirectional power flow with the external grid supplier, ifneeded. The V2G programme is activated when the EMS sends the signal to the aggregatorthat power dispatch from the EVs is required. As long as the signal is not received, the EVsare idle or charged and used as a virtual battery storage device. Finally, we assumed that theCHP is used to balance the power management within the microgrid, if required.4.3.6 Results and DiscussionWe assumed that at the beginning of the simulation, 50 EVs are participating in the V2Gscheme. Then, we simulated the arrival process of new EVs as a stochastic process whereevery minute a new EV arrives with probability 5% until the airport car park is full. TheEVs arrive with an initial random SOC greater than 10%, and with a desired SOCmin, whichcorresponds to the minimum level of the battery that is strictly required to return home fromthe airport at the end of the journey. If SOCmin is smaller or equal to the initial SOC, the EVimmediately starts participating in the V2G programme, and as illustrated in the algorithm,its SOC will never drop below SOCmin. If SOCmin is greater than the initial SOC, then thegrid treats the EV as a normal load, and only when the SOC reaches the level of SOCmin doesthe EV start to participate in the V2G programme. We assumed that the efficiency parameterof the batteries was different for each EV, and varied it between 80% to 90% uniformly.We assumed that the cost of generating power with the CHP was a quadratic function withparameters \u03b1 = 2, \u03b2 = \u22123 and \u03b3 = 8. Then, we assumed that the grid would give revenues tothe EVs according to another quadratic function with parameters \u03b1i = 1, \u03b2i = \u22125 and \u03b3i = 8.With such values, it is always more cost effective for the grid to take energy from the EVsrather than from the CHP (though, obviously, other pricing functions could be chosen toobtain the same result). In addition, we set the iterative update time \u2206T to 1 minute, whichcorresponds to the sampling rate of the base load, and the optimisation parameters \u03b7i and \u00b5were set to 0.001.We now first illustrate the dynamics of the ODC algorithm and analyse the performanceof the algorithm from the perspective of fair discharging of EV batteries. Then, we show thebenefits for the microgrid of introducing the V2G regulation service by simulation studies.Comment: Figure 4.15 illustrates the discharge rates of all available EVs during the V2Gpower dispatch. It can be seen that the discharge rates are approximately the same for all theEVs. To better appreciate such a result, we now use the fairness index introduced in [46],4.3 Optimal V2G Power Dispatch 9712am 4am 8am 12pm 4pm 8pm 12am00.511.522.5Time(hour)Power(kW)Fig. 4.15 Discharge rates of the EVs with V2G in operation12am 4am 8am 12pm 4pm 8pm 12am00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.911.1Time(hour)Fairness indexFig. 4.16 Fairness index of the ODC algorithm with V2G in operation4.3 Optimal V2G Power Dispatch 98which is given by:FI (k) =( \u2211i\u2208\u03a6(k)ci (k))2|\u03a6(k) | \u00b7 \u2211i\u2208\u03a6(k)ci (k)2, \u2200k \u2208 {1,2, ...,M } (4.25)where |\u03a6(k) | denotes the total number of elements in the set \u03a6(k). Figure 4.16 shows thatthe V2G procedure is fair, apart for some transitory time intervals when a new EV startsparticipating in the scheme. However, fairness is restored in a very short time. The maximumpower that can be generated by each of the DGs is depicted in Figure 4.17.The power generated by the DGs is shown in Figure 4.18. In Figure 4.18, Totaldemandrefers to the power required by the Baseload plus that required by the EVs that are beingcharged until they reach the required level SOCmin. DGmax denotes the maximum powerthat can be generated by all DGs, DGnoCHP indicates the total maximum power generationby all DGs without considering the CHP, which corresponds to the power generated byrenewable sources, and DGnoCHP + V2G corresponds to the power generated by renewablesources plus that stored in EVs. In practice, when the total power generated by renewablessources is smaller than the base load, then the EVs with high SOC are discharged. Vice versa,when the total power generated by renewables sources is greater than the base load, then theEVs participating to the V2G programme are recharged.The economic benefits for all stakeholders participating in the V2G scheme are illustratedin Figures 4.19-4.22. The economic benefits for EV owners are demonstrated in Figures4.19-4.20. Further, it is shown clearly from Figures 4.21-4.22 that both the grid company andEV owners benefit from adopting the proposed V2G scheme (Note: the \u201cmagnitude\u201d on they-axis of these figures only illustrates numerical results (i.e. dimensionless) under specifiedsetup for comparison purposes). Hence, both stakeholders are incentivised to participate inthe V2G scheme resulting in better utilisation of EVs and renewable energy sources.4.3 Optimal V2G Power Dispatch 9912am 4am 8am 12pm 4pm 8pm 12am0100200300400500600700800Time(hour)Power(kW)  Wind DG1Wind DG2Wind DG3PV DG1PV DG2CHP DGFig. 4.17 Power generation profiles of DGs12am 4am 8am 12pm 4pm 8pm 12am800100012001400160018002000220024002600Time(hour)Power(kW)  BaseloadTotaldemandDGmaxDGnoCHPDGnoCHP+V2GEV loadsV2G powerFig. 4.18 Comparison of demand and power generation with V2G and EV loads4.3 Optimal V2G Power Dispatch 10012am 4am 8am 12pm 4pm 8pm 12am0100200300400500600700800Time(hour)MagnitudeFig. 4.19 Accumulative economical benefits for each EV in the scheme12am 4am 8am 12pm 4pm 8pm 12am0200040006000800010000120001400016000Time(hour)MagnitudeFig. 4.20 Accumulative economical benefits for all EVs in the scheme4.3 Optimal V2G Power Dispatch 10112am 4am 8am 12pm 4pm 8pm 12am0100200300400500600700800Time(hour)MagnitudeFig. 4.21 Economical benefits for the grid at each time slot12am 4am 8am 12pm 4pm 8pm 12am00.511.522.5x 105Time(hour)MagnitudeFig. 4.22 Accumulative economical benefits for the grid4.4 Conclusions 1024.4 ConclusionsIn this chapter we have shown that by harnessing the power of V2G technologies, groups ofEVs can be used to provide effective ancillary services to the grid. Specifically, we investigatetwo V2G applications in different scenarios.In the first scenario, we applied a recently proposed distributed consensus algorithmin [94] to a group of EVs to design an EV charging strategy which minimises the currentimbalance on a three phase distribution network. Matlab simulations were presented to illus-trate the consensus characteristics and rate of convergence of the algorithm. Realistic powersystem simulations were implemented on a dedicated testbed to demonstrate the effectivenessof the algorithm in terms of the reductions in power losses and current imbalance.In the second scenario, we applied an optimal decentralised consensus algorithm to designa fair V2G programme. In this programme, a microgrid stores the surplus energy generatedby renewable sources in EV batteries, and takes it back when needed. The optimality of theV2G strategy is with respect to utility functions that contain an economic term (the moreenergy taken from the EVs, the better for the grid), and a QoS term (the energy taken fromthe EV batteries must be limited to avoid getting close to the minimum level of SOC requiredto complete the journey home when the owner takes his/her EV). Then, we formulated thefair power dispatch problem of EVs as an optimisation problem with consensus constraints.The chapter also derived a specific form of function G in system (2.22) based on firstorder optimality conditions and demonstrated that such a system can be used to solve a classof optimisation problem with consensus constraints. We further applied this result to solveour specific optimisation problem by including realistic grid constraints and we illustrated theresulting optimal decentralised consensus algorithm. To evaluate this strategy, we simulatedthe ODC algorithm on a Matlab/OpenDSS testbed, and demonstrated its performance both interms of fairness and in terms of economic convenience for the grid.As a conclusion, the overall objective in this chapter was to apply consensus based algo-rithms to solve two specific application problems by using V2G techniques. The consensusalgorithm in the first application was used to regulate active and reactive power consumptionon each phase of the grid network such that the current imbalance can be minimised. Incontrast, in the second application, the consensus algorithm was applied in an optimisationframework, where the consensus of the algorithm refers to the \u201cfairness\u201d in terms of theamount of power dispatch from EVs. The optimality of the algorithm was achieved by addinga common feedback term to the basic consensus algorithm, and a specific form was laterderived which guarantees the first order optimality condition. Finally, note that the proposedoptimisation framework is useful to solve other problems in different scenarios as we shallsee later in Chapters 6 and 7.Part IIIOptimal Energy Management Strategiesin Smart GridChapter 5Optimal Algorithms for EnergyManagementAbstract: In this chapter, we adapt the distributed AIMD algorithm to optimally share thepower generation tasks for distributed energy resources in a microgrid scenario. This idea isfurther extended to incorporate thermal constraints for double power balancing requirements.The work in this chapter was undertaken in cooperation with Emanuele Crisostomi, MarcoRaugi, and Robert Shorten, and published in [35, 106].5.1 IntroductionOne of the most interesting and challenging objectives of the smart grid is to enable situationalawareness of the grid, and to allow for fast-acting changes in power production and powerrouting, thus altering the stream of electrical supply and demand on a moment-by-momentbasis. However, balancing the energy demand and the energy offer is a challenging problemdue to a number of effects, e.g., the uncertain demand and the energy that can be offered.\u2022 The uncertain demand. This refers to the uncertain energy consumption of bothindustries and single users. Many authors have addressed this problem using techniquesfrom machine learning and time series analysis in an attempt to accurately forecast thepower load [131, 132, 148, 193].\u2022 The uncertain energy offer. As the penetration level of energy being produced fromrenewable sources is constantly increasing, the availability of energy is highly affectedby weather conditions (i.e., availability of sun/wind). More accurate weather forecastservices, together with an extensive use of storage systems, are currently used tomitigate such uncertainties [206].5.1 Introduction 105In addition, such an ambitious objective (i.e. real-time power balancing) also posesdifficult issues for the Energy Management System (EMS) of the power network in termsof communication and control. In fact, in order to optimally share the power generationtask among the DERs, the EMS is required to solve an optimal scheduling problem at fixedtime steps, typically chosen between 5 and 30 minutes. To solve this problem, it is usuallynecessary to apply a centralised based optimisation to determine the optimal solution at everyfixed time step. However, this centralised solution has the main drawback of a significantcommunication overhead, as every single DER must communicate to the EMS how muchpower can be provided. Then, the EMS must gather all this information, and the energyneeded by all users, to solve an optimisation problem, and communicate back to each DER itscorrect allocation of energy. See for instance [4, 149, 150] for examples of this approach tooptimal power scheduling. In the future, when considering a larger energy system frameworkwith heating devices (e.g. CHPs), the communication and control of power generation willbecome even more difficult since the amount of electrical power generation is associatedwith the amount of thermal power generation.To overcome these issues, some authors have designed day-ahead thermal and electricalscheduling algorithms for large-scale VPPs (LSVPPs) [62, 101, 159] where the day-aheadunit commitment problem is solved in a distributed fashion. In [194] the day-ahead solutionis then corrected in a centralised framework, considering latest available measurements.In fact, in the afternoon prior to the scheduled energy delivery, the hourly prices for thefollowing day (set by electricity spot markets) are already known, and at the same time, quiteaccurate weather and load forecasts are also available [62]. This approach is for the most parteffective. However, it does not consider real-time information, such as the error between theavailable power and that predicted on the basis of weather forecast, that could be important tofully exploit renewable resources. In addition, this solution is not robust, and problems in theEMS will have consequences for the entire network in terms of grid stability. Therefore, it isdesirable to design an algorithm that automatically shares the power generation tasks amongthe available DERs satisfying the energy demand and to reduce the increasing requirementsin terms of communication overhead and complex control of the conventional EMS.In the last chapter, we investigated the optimal V2G power dispatch of EVs in a low-voltage microgid using the proposed optimised distributed consensus algorithm. The ideaof this distributed algorithm arises from the convergence and optimality of the dynamicalsystem introduced in Chapters 2 and 4. In this chapter, we consider the optimal powerdispatch problem of DGs in a VPP scenario. We show that by adapting an AIMD algorithm[33, 189], which has been introduced in Section 3.3.2, a cost utility function of interest canbe minimised in a distributed manner. To show the efficacy of the algorithm, we implement5.2 Problem Statement and Preliminaries 106the proposed strategies in a realistic power network simulation with a few DERs and a totalload of the order of a few MW. With these results we show that the achievable performance isvery close to the full communication centralised case. In addition, we also demonstrate thatthe idea of the algorithm can be further extended to include thermal balancing requirementsand provide supporting simulation studies.The remainder of this chapter is organised as follows. Section 5.2 describes the powergeneration problem and the financial cost function of a microgrid. Section 5.3 reviews thebasic AIMD algorithm and explains how it can be adapted to minimise power generationcosts in a distributed manner. In the same section we also explain how the proposed algorithmcan be adapted to optimise both thermal and electrical scheduling. Section 5.4 introducesthe simulation setup using a Matlab/OpenDSS environment, and compares the performanceof the proposed algorithm with that of a fully centralised solution in two scenarios, i.e., onescenario considers the electrical scheduling and the other considers the scheduling for bothelectrical and thermal power generation. Finally, Section 5.5 concludes the chapter.5.2 Problem Statement and PreliminariesWe consider the scenario depicted in Figure 5.1, and assume that at a given time k, each oneof N DERs provides an amount of power denoted as pi (k), where the index i refers to theith DER. In addition, we define the set N := {1,2, . . .,N } for indexing all DERs. Our mainFig. 5.1 DERs (on the left) must provide enough energy to satisfy the demand coming fromthe users (e.g., from industries and residential areas).5.2 Problem Statement and Preliminaries 107assumption is that at every time step k, the overall set of DERs is always able to provide thetotal power d(k) required by the users. Therefore, the EMS has the ability to choose whichof the DERs will be used, and in which proportion, to provide the requested power.Remark: Note that the assumption that the power requested by the users is smaller or equalto the capacity of the DERs is not a strong assumption. In fact, if this is not true, then theEMS can either take more energy from storage systems, or buy it from other VPPs or fromthe external grid. It may also decide to disconnect some of the loads, thus reducing thedemanded power. After completing any of the previous actions, the condition that the energyproduced by the DERs is enough to satisfy the (residual) demand holds. Many papers in theliterature have tackled the problem of which of these actions is more convenient from theEMS point of view; see for instance [4], [149] and [150] that propose optimal schedulingsolutions. However, this problem is not of interest here. In this work it is more convenientto simply assume that the demand is smaller than the power deliverable from the DERs;otherwise, the load is provided in a best effort fashion.As the DERs provide more or equal power than is required by the users, the purpose of thischapter is to automatically allocate power generation tasks among DERs in a decentralisedmanner such that some utility function of interest is minimised; namely, the financial costassociated with power generation.5.2.1 Utility MinimisationIn principle, the EMS has many ways of sharing the power demand among the availableDERs. We are interested in the power share that minimises the financial cost of producingthe desired power. To solve this problem, we associate each DER with a quadratic utilityfunction, as is common in the VPP literature, see [20] and [149].C(Pg)= a \u00b7 Pg2+b \u00b7 Pg+ c, (5.1)where C is the hourly cost in Currency Unit (C.U.) per hour, Pg is the generated power in MW,and a, b and c are coefficients of appropriate measurement unit that depend on the technologyof the power plant (e.g., fuel cost, efficiency, etc). In particular, b includes operation andmaintenance costs (O&M) costs, and fuel and carbon costs, which are usually expressed ine/MWh (or in /kWh). The coefficient c takes into account the expenses that are incurred evenif no energy is produced at all. Quadratic cost functions have been used in many referencesin the literature, see for instance the classic reference [151], or the more recent references5.3 AIMD based Utility Optimisation Algorithms 108[20] and [149] in the context of VPPs. Due to the fact that the coefficients a are usually quitesmall, and because of the difficulty of handling nonlinear (though quadratic) cost functions,many authors in the literature simply neglect the quadratic term, and use affine functions inthe optimisation; see for instance [4]. Also note that in the literature it is very simple to finddatabases containing values of coefficients b and c for several examples of DERs all over theworld, for the computation of the Levelised Costs of Electricity (LCOE) [180].In this work we use the complete quadratic cost function (5.1) to minimise total financialcosts of the DERs. Note that the quadratic cost functions can also be used to model anenvironmentally friendly utility function (e.g., CO2 or SO2 emissions in terms of activepower generation of a traditional power plant) to stimulate the penetration of renewables[41, 63]. However, the study can be extended for minimisation of other convex utilityfunctions of interest, which is the subject of our current work.5.3 AIMD based Utility Optimisation AlgorithmsThe problems that we described are very close to those encountered in Internet congestioncontrol. In Internet congestion control, one tries to allocate bandwidth such that certainobjectives are realised [186]. A wide variety of work has been published in this area and it canbe shown that TCP Reno and TCP Vegas both correspond to different utility maximisationsolutions [186]. In AIMD an individual agent (e.g., a computer sending packets) gentlyincreases its transmission rate, during the Additive Increase (AI) phase, until a packetloss signal is received. This is called a congestion event, and indicates that the sum ofindividual bandwidths has exceeded the total capacity. Upon detecting congestion, the agentsinstantaneously decrease their transmission rate in a multiplicative fashion. This is theMultiplicative Decrease (MD) phase of the algorithm [28].Note that the congestion control problem in the Internet exhibits similar characteristicsto the power generation scenario considered here. The quantities of interest are positive(bandwidth/power), locally bounded (local maximum transmission rate/available power), theavailable capacity/required energy may vary over time, and the system of interconnectedagents (Internet/Smart Grid) is very large scale. We refer the reader to Section 3.3.2 for theapplication of AIMD algorithms in an EV charging context and references [28, 33, 34, 177,178] for a detailed discussion on convergence properties of the AIMD algorithms.5.3 AIMD based Utility Optimisation Algorithms 1095.3.1 AIMDIn this section we recall the basic AIMD algorithm introduced in Section 3.3.2 and adapt theAIMD algorithm to the new scenario of interest here.Algorithm 7 Basic AIMD Algorithm (pi)pi (0) = pi0while simulation not ended doifN\u2211i=1pi (k) < d(k) thenpi (k +1) = min(pi (k)+\u03b1i, pi (k)), \u2200i \u2208 N (AI)elsepi (k +1) = max(\u03b2i pi (k), pi (k)), \u2200i \u2208 N (MD)end ifk = k +1end whileIn Algorithm 7, the parameter \u03b1i is the positive additive parameter associated with theadditive increase phase of the algorithm (AI) (expressed in kW or MW), and 0 < \u03b2i \u2264 1is the multiplicative parameter used in the decrease phase (MD). The quantities pi(k) andpi (k) denote the minimum and maximum bound on the power respectively. pi (k) repre-sents the real power output from the ith DER at time k. In fact, the values of pi cannottake arbitrary values due to: (i) the limited sizes of the DERs; (ii) the availability of re-newables (sun/wind); (iii) the power network constraints (e.g., transformer tap settings,security constraints, minimum voltages at load buses and transmission lines); and (iv) dueto the physical constraints on the DER ramp rate. Note also that such bounds are time varying.Remark: The main feature that makes the AIMD algorithm particularly convenient to applyin large-scale systems, is that the algorithm can be easily implemented in a truly distributedmanner. In fact, Algorithm 7 only requires the EMS to send a \u201ccongestion notification\u201d tothe DERs when the produced power equals the demanded power, which can be coded ina single bit of information. In the context of power balancing, such a notification will bedenoted as balancing notification in the remainder of the chapter. This implies that the DERsdo not have to exchange information among themselves, do not have to communicate theavailable sun/wind to the EMS, and also do not even have to communicate when they stop orstart contributing to the power generation task. Furthermore, the EMS itself does not have tocommunicate to the DERs how much power they must provide. Note that in Algorithm 1(Section 3.3.2) the MD phase consists of two multiplicative parameters selected randomlywhere in Algorithm 7 only one multiplicative parameter is chosen. Having two (or more)5.3 AIMD based Utility Optimisation Algorithms 110multiplicative parameters gives more flexibility for implementation of the AIMD algorithm.For instance, in the EV charging scenario, one could design a larger multiplicative parameterto increase power utilisation and a smaller multiplicative parameter to reduce the numberof congestions events. For the applications considered in this chapter, the more complexmulti-parameter implementation of the algorithm is not required.In order to illustrate in a simple fashion the mechanism of the basic AIMD algorithm(Algorithm 7), Figures 5.2 to 5.5 illustrate the output of the algorithm in a simple toy example,which corresponds to the VPP scenario investigated in [4]. Therefore, we assume that threeDERs are available: a PV plant; a wind plant; and a CHP. It is assumed that the PV planthas a net capacity of 6 MW and a capacity factor of 6%; the wind plant has a net capacity of45 MW and a capacity factor of 27%; the CHP plant has a net electrical capacity of 40 MWand a capacity factor of 85%. We assume that all DERs have the same \u03b1i and \u03b2i parametersequal to 0.01 MW and 0.95 respectively. Figure 5.2 illustrates the case without constraints(i.e., without even considering the sizes of the power plants), when the power demand isconstant and equal to 35 MW. Note that in this case AIMD gives rise to the fair solutionwhere each single DER produces exactly the same quantity of energy. When the smallersizes of the renewable energy sources, together with renewable availability (e.g., no sunat night time) are introduced, the AIMD solution provides completely different results asdepicted in Figure 5.3. The case study scenario is further complicated, if a more realisticnon-constant power demand is associated. The corresponding results are shown in Figure5.4 (the time-varying demanded power profile is taken again from [4]). In the same scenario,Figure 5.5 compares the associated power demand and power generation. Note that powergenerated by the individual DER is now summed, and, as expected, demand and offer areperfectly balanced.Remark: Algorithm 7 illustrated in this section gives rise to saw-tooth signals. Note thatnot all equipment may be capable of handling such signals. Thus, typical methods that arealready used to handle oscillating power generated from renewable sources might be required(e.g., PI-smoothing of the output power, pre-filtering of the AIMD signal, use of batteries forprimary frequency and voltage control).5.3.2 Utility Optimisation via Synchronised AIMDThe basic AIMD algorithm is designed to share the required energy among the availableDERs in some manner. For instance, if there were no constraints, then each DER wouldprovide the same quantity of energy as illustrated in Figure 5.2. In this section we show5.3 AIMD based Utility Optimisation Algorithms 11100.00 04.00 08.00 12.00 16.00 20.00 00.0005101520253035404550Time [h]Power (MW)(a)  Wind Generated PowerCHP Generated PowerSolar PV Generated PowerDemanded PowerFig. 5.2 A scenario where a PhotoVoltaic (PV) plant, a wind plant and a CHP are required toprovide a (static) power of 35 MW. The fair sharing solution is that all plants provide thesame power.that by appropriately modifying the basic AIMD algorithm, it is possible to minimise thefinancial cost of generating the required power, according to the cost functions introduced inSection 5.2.1. Similar work in this direction can be found in [34, 84, 189]. The optimisationproblem can be formally stated asminpi (k)N\u2211i=1fi (pi (k))subject to:N\u2211i=1pi (k) = d(k)(5.2)i.e., at every time step k we want to find the combination of pi (k) such that the generatedpower is equal to the requested power, and it minimises the sum of the cost functions.Further, we assume that the optimal solution of pi (k) is in the interior of the polytope,constructed by the constraints, as a feasible region [16]. Each utility function has the formfi (pi (k)) = ai \u00b7 pi (k)2 + bi \u00b7 pi (k) + ci, as was described in Section 5.2.1. Note that in thissection we do not consider the constraints on the single pi (k), as the AIMD algorithm willautomatically satisfy them as described in Section 5.3.1. This minimisation problem can then5.3 AIMD based Utility Optimisation Algorithms 11200.00 04.00 08.00 12.00 16.00 20.00 00.0005101520253035404550Time [h]Power (MW)(b)  Wind Power generationCHP Power generationSolar PV Power generationDemanded PowerFig. 5.3 Constraints on the plant sizes and availability of solar / wind.00.00 04.00 08.00 12.00 16.00 20.00 00.0005101520253035404550Time [h]Power [MW](c)  Wind Power generationCHP Power generationSolar PV Power generationDemanded PowerFig. 5.4 A typical non-constant energy requirement.5.3 AIMD based Utility Optimisation Algorithms 11300.00 04.00 08.00 12.00 16.00 20.00 00.0005101520253035404550Time [h]Power [MW](d)  Total Generated PowerTotal Scheduled PowerFig. 5.5 Required and provided power (summing contributions of single plants) of scenarioin Fig. 5.4.be conveniently solved at each time step k with the aid of Lagrange multipliers. With this inmind, the optimal solution p\u2217i (k) can be obtained by solving the following equations:\u2202[N\u2211i=1fi(pi (k))+ \u03bb(k)(d(k)\u2212\u2211Ni=1 pi (k))]\u2202pi (k)= 0, \u2200i \u2208 N (5.3)where \u03bb(k) represents the Lagrange multiplier for the linear constraint\u2211Ni=1 pi (k) = d(k).By substituting fi (pi (k)) = ai \u00b7 pi (k)2+ bi \u00b7 pi (k)+ ci, we obtainp\u2217i (k) =\u03bb\u2217(k)\u2212 bi2ai, (5.4)where\u03bb\u2217(k) =d(k)+N\u2211i=1bi2aiN\u2211i=112ai(5.5)subject to the linear constraint being satisfied, and where the uniqueness of the solutionfollows from the convexity of the quadratic functions. Note that the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT) conditions (5.3) are necessary for optimality [16]. By placing extra conditions (i.e.,the convexity) on the utility functions they are also sufficient. Our approach is similar, but5.3 AIMD based Utility Optimisation Algorithms 114we solve the minimisation problem by achieving consensus on the value of the function\u03bbi (k) := \u2202 fi (pi (k))/\u2202pi (k), i.e., \u03bbi (k) = \u03bb j (k), \u2200i, j \u2208 N, subject to the linear constraint.Note that the consensus condition can be derived from (5.3). To this end, the basic AIMDalgorithm can be adapted for utility optimisation purposes as follows:Algorithm 8 AIMD Utility Optimisation (\u03bbi)pi (0) = pi0while simulation not ended doifn\u2211i=1pi (k) < d(k) then\u03bbi (k +1) = \u03bbi (k)+\u03b1\u03bb, \u2200i \u2208 N (AI)else\u03bbi (k +1) = \u03b2\u03bb\u03bbi (k), \u2200i \u2208 N (MD)end ifk = k +1end whileIn Algorithm 8, the multiplicative step is performed when the sum of delivered powerexceeds the requested power. All DERs have the same parameters \u03b1\u03bb and \u03b2\u03bb , so called todenote that they refer to an AIMD algorithm applied to the variable \u03bb. Therefore, AIMDmakes all \u03bbi converge to a unique value which is \u03bb\u2217. Note that each DER has to update itsown variable \u03bbi, and the only communication requirement is the balancing notification fromthe EMS.5.3.3 Practical ImplementationThe utility optimisation problem can be theoretically solved by simply running an AIMDconsensus problem on \u03bbi, as when all DERs have the same value of \u03bbi, then this valuehas to be \u03bb\u2217. However, \u03bbi (k) = \u2202 fi (pi (k))/\u2202pi (k) is only an abstract quantity which, forthe choice of utility functions considered here, is 2ai pi (k)+ bi; it is not straightforward tocompute how a DER can change its own value of \u03bbi (k) by adjusting its power generation,and also how to express the power constraints in terms of \u03bbi (k). Therefore, we now remapthe AIMD algorithm in terms of pi (k) instead of \u03bbi (k). By simply exploiting the fact that\u03bbi (k) = 2ai pi (k)+ bi, we can rewrite Algorithm 8 as Algorithm 9.Note that this algorithm provides the same solution as Algorithm 8 with parameters \u03b1\u03bband \u03b2\u03bb , and is formally identical to Algorithm 7 when the parameters for each DER aredefined as5.3 AIMD based Utility Optimisation Algorithms 115Algorithm 9 AIMD Utility Optimisation (pi)pi (0) = pi0while simulation not ended doifN\u2211i=1pi (k) < d(k) thenpi (k +1) = min(pi (k)+\u03b1\u03bb2ai, pi (k)), \u2200i \u2208 N (AI)elsepi (k +1) = max((\u03b2\u03bb + bi\u03b2\u03bb\u221212ai pi (k))pi (k), pi (k)), \u2200i \u2208 N (MD)end ifk = k +1end while\u03b1i =\u03b1\u03bb2ai\u03b2i (k) = \u03b2\u03bb + bi \u00b7 \u03b2\u03bb \u221212ai pi (k) . (5.6)Algorithm 9 solves the utility optimisation problem, while retaining the convenientfeature of AIMD that the only required communication is the notification of the balancingevent, broadcasted by the EMS to all the DERs. The only required assumption is that eachDER knows its own cost function (i.e., parameters ai, bi and ci that associate their owngenerated power with the financial costs) as this information is needed to tune the personalAIMD parameters \u03b1i and \u03b2i.5.3.4 Extensions for Thermal and Electrical SchedulingIn this section, we shall demonstrate how to extend the idea in Algorithm 9 to include thermalbalancing requirements. To this end, we describe the optimisation problem and develop afull AIMD algorithm for solving the problem.To be consistent with the previous sections, we still adopt quadratic utility functions forthe total financial costs from DGs. However, the objective of the new AIMD algorithm isto compute the optimal instantaneous peti (k) and pthi (k) (i.e. electrical and thermal power5.3 AIMD based Utility Optimisation Algorithms 116generated by the ith DER) that minimise the total cost of power generation, while satisfyingthe power demand by the users; mathematically this optimisation problem is given as:minpeli (k),pthi (k)N\u2211i=1f eli (peli (k))+ fthi (pthi (k))subject to:\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f3\u2211Ni=1 peli (k) = del(k)\u2211Ni=1 pthi (k) = dth(k)\uf8fc\uf8f4\uf8fd\uf8f4\uf8fe(5.7)In optimisation problem (5.7), the electrical and thermal power flows of the ith DER aredenoted by peli and pthi , respectively. The formulation problem (5.7) is a general one, as weare assuming that each DER could in principle generate both thermal and electric power.Also, we are assuming that the cost functions for producing thermal or electrical powercould be different. This general formulation allows us to consider indirect thermal powerproduction, e.g., a PV plant could be connected to a boiler and be simultaneously used toprovide thermal power. In this section, utility functions for both the electrical ( f eli ) and thethermal ( f thi ) are modelled as quadratic functions.To solve (5.7), we need to suitably tailor the AIMD algorithms in order to achievea second balancing objective, related to the thermal power flows. Thus, we design theAlgorithm 10 which alternatively performs an AIMD step on the electrical power, and oneon the thermal power; also, as the two steps are strongly related (e.g. the electrical powerproduction of a CHP is coupled with its thermal production), we give priority to one of thetwo power balancing loops, namely, the thermal loop. The motivation to do so is that mostpower plants have the ability to generate electrical power, while usually only a subset ofthem can also directly provide thermal power.Note that in Algorithm 10, the electrical AIMD step is performed by a subset of all DERsN denoted as M; in particular, the DERs in the set M are not involved in the thermal powerbalancing loop. This strategy has been used to deal with the case where the thermal AIMDalgorithm requires some DERs to increase their thermal power generation (i.e. because thethermal demand is greater than the supply), while the electrical AIMD algorithm requiressome DERs to decrease their electrical power generation (i.e., because the electrical demandis lower than supply). As the quantity of electrical power provided by a DER is usually relatedto the provided thermal power, such a conflicting situation is not simple to handle. A possibleway to solve it is to appropriately choose the value of \u03b1thi , \u03b1eli , \u03b2thi and \u03b2eli to give moreimportance to the thermal balancing loop; alternatively, which is the solution implementedhere in Algorithm 10, we assume that a subset of DERs is used only to accommodate theresidual electrical power request.5.4 Case Studies 117Algorithm 10 Full AIMD Algorithm (pthi (k), peli (k))pthi (0) = pthi0, peli (0) = peli0while simulation not ended doifN\u2211i=1pthi (k) < dth(k) thenpthi (k +1) = min(pthi (k)+\u03b1thi , pthi (k)), \u2200i \u2208 N (AI)elsepthi (k +1) = max(\u03b2thi pthi (k), pthi(k)), \u2200i \u2208 N (MD)end ififN\u2211i=1peli (k) < del(k) thenpeli (k +1) = min(peli (k)+\u03b1eli , peli (k)), \u2200i \u2208 M (AI)elsepeli (k +1) = max(\u03b2eli peli (k), peli(k)), \u2200i \u2208 M (MD)end ifk = k +1end whileComment: Similar to (5.2), the optimisation problem (5.7) can be easily solved by appropri-ately choosing the AIMD parameters; in particular, the optimal choice is\u03b1th,eli =\u03b1th,el\u03bb2ath,eli\u03b2th,eli (k) = \u03b2th,el\u03bb + bth,eli \u00b7\u03b2th,el\u03bb \u221212ath,eli pth,eli (k).

Also, 0 < \u03b2th,el\u03bb < 1 and \u03b1th,el\u03bb are two arbitraryparameters that can be used to adjust the AIMD speed of convergence properties.5.4 Case Studies5.4.1 Simulations for the Electrical SchedulingIn order to evaluate the performance of our proposed AIMD utility optimisation strategy ina more realistic fashion, we tested our algorithms on a revised version of the distributionpower system based on the IEEE 37 bus test feeder [87]. This test network incorporates a5.4 Case Studies 118Fig. 5.6 Schematic topology of the tested network.certain amount of loads, is served by several DERs, and connects to the microgrid (or VPP).Figure 5.6 illustrates the topology of our test network.In our simulations, the base voltage of the High-Voltage (HV) network was set to 110kV(1.0 pu) at the source-end of the external grid. A 2.5MVA distribution substation wasconnected to the external grid to bring the voltage level down to 10kV, which is a typicalMedium-Voltage (MV) level in European power systems. We considered three wind DERs,two PV DERs, and a CHP. Each DER is able to produce power to the MV substation viaa connected transformer. To simplify our model, we assumed that the same type of DERshad the same level of generation capacity. However, the real power output from each DERwas dependent on the available resource (e.g., wind speed/solar intensity) and the requestedpower from the load area at each time slot. In addition to this, all the DERs were modeledas constant P-Q generators with the same power factors equal to 1.0 to generate pure activepower for the loads. It is clearly not realistic to assume that DERs produce pure active powerand to model the loads without reactive power consumption. However, we did so as anexample of this chapter to illustrate the algorithm works effectively from the perspective ofactive power generation. In practice, this corresponds to assuming that the reactive power isprovided by some ancillary services in the power network (e.g., capacitance tanks, reactiveV2G and G2V services), or bought from the external grid. Note that the AIMD algorithmcould be further extended through a double prioritised algorithm to accomplish reactive5.4 Case Studies 119Table 5.1 Parameters of the utility functionsPlant ai bi ciWind Plant 1 0.0027 17.83 4.46Wind Plant 2 0.0028 17.54 4.45Wind Plant 3 0.0026 17.23 4.44Solar PV 1 0.0055 29.30 4.45Solar PV 2 0.0055 29.58 4.46CHP 0.0083 75.73 5.21power management, as shown in the recent reference [190] in the context of EV charging,and is not shown here in the interest of conciseness.We also assumed that the wind plants, the PV plants and the CHP had a capacity of 750kW, 200 kW and 1 MW respectively. Such values typically allow the microgrid to workin island mode, i.e., the required power is less than the power provided by the DERs, asassumed in Section 5.2. We assumed that each load had a power factor of 0.95 lagging, andload profiles were randomly chosen for a period of 24 hours, according to reference [165].The maximum wind power output for each wind DER was randomly chosen from real windturbine data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) [141]. The maximumsolar power generation profile of each PV was computed according to a quadratic functionwith non-zero values from 6am to 6pm, randomly perturbed to simulate cloud disturbances,as in [4]. The parameters of the utility functions were taken from [149] and [180] and aresummarised in Table 5.1. Note that in the current model the unit of the utility functions isrepresented by US dollars, but it can be easily converted to Euro or other units of interestby simply multiplying the currency exchange rate. We decided to sample the load profilesand the maximum output of the DERs every 5 minutes, and assumed that they would beconstant during such a time lapse. The whole scenario was simulated using a customisedOpenDSS-Matlab simulation platform [43]. In particular, Matlab was used to generate thepower dispatch data for each DER, and a day power system simulation was implementedby OpenDSS to evaluate the state of the network, e.g., line voltage, substation power flow,power losses, for each time slot.Now we illustrate the simulation results obtained by implementing the proposed AIMDutility optimisation algorithm in the network described in the previous section. To betterevaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we compared our distributed solutionwith the optimal one obtained in a centralised fashion which relies on a full exchangeof information among DERs and the EMS. The centralised solution is computed every 55.4 Case Studies 120minutes, assuming that the EMS is informed of the maximum power that each DER canprovide (depending on wind/sun availability) and also by the power required by the users.Then we assumed that the EMS had the ability to solve instantaneously the constrainedoptimisation problem (i.e., considering the power network constraints) and to schedulethe optimal power flows to the DERs. As for the AIMD case, each step of the algorithmimplementation was iterated every 5 seconds.The simulation results obtained are summarised in Figures 5.7 to 5.10. Figure 5.7 depictsthat both the centralised algorithm and the proposed distributed one manage to balance thegenerated power with that required by the users. We also show the maximum power thatcould be generated by all the DERs working at full capacity. Figure 5.8 illustrates howmuch power was generated by each single DER. As can be noted, the CHP is mainly used toback-up the energy production from the renewable plants, as it is less economical from thepoint of view of the cost function being considered here (i.e., due to its fuel and carbon costs).Figure 5.9 shows that the value of the utility function is almost the same as would have beenobtained by implementing a fully centralised approach. Finally, Figure 5.10 shows that thecommunication requirement of the AIMD performed every 5 seconds is similar to that ofthe centralised solution performed every 5 minutes. However, even in the simple scenarioadopted for this comparison, as can be seen from the same figure, the centralised solution cannot be used at faster time scales and if we use the same step size for both approaches, thenthe communication requirement of the centralised approach becomes about 100 times largerthan that of AIMD. Clearly, as the operation of smart grids is heading towards real-timefully automated practices, AIMD-like techniques are much more desirable than a centralisedsolution from a communication perspective.5.4.2 Simulations for Thermal and Electrical SchedulingIn this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed double priority AIMD utilityoptimisation implementation in a similar microgrid scenario as described in Section 5.4.1.The topology of the tested network is illustrated in Figure 5.11. In this network, we assumethat several DERs are installed and that they collectively have sufficient capacity to participatein the electricity market and serve both thermal and electrical demand in the load area. In oursimulation, the base voltage of the HV network was set to 110kV (1.0pu) at the source-endof the external grid. Two HV/MV transformers were applied to step down the voltage from110kV to 10kV in the load area. In addition, several 110/10kV transformers were used tostep up the voltage generated from the DERs to the HV power network. We considered threewind plants, two PV plants, and two CHPs. We assume that the generation capacity of eachCHP is sufficient to serve its local fixed electrical load. Also, CHPs must have the ability to5.4 Case Studies 12100:00 03:00 06:00 09:00 12:00 15:00 18:00 21:00 00:000500100015002000250030003500Hour of the day [h]Power [kW](a)  Maximum power that could be generated by all DERsRequired powerPower generated with AIMD algorithmPower generated with centralized algorithmFig. 5.7 Comparisons of the distributed AIMD solution and the optimal centralised solutionon electrical power balancing during the whole day00:00 03:00 06:00 09:00 12:00 15:00 18:00 21:00 00:0001002003004005006007008009001000Hour of the day [h]Generated power [kW](b)  WP1WP2WP3PV1PV2CHPFig. 5.8 The detail of how AIMD shares the energy production.5.4 Case Studies 12200:00 03:00 06:00 09:00 12:00 15:00 18:00 21:00 00:0000.0050.010.0150.020.0250.03Hour of the day [h]Costs [Dollars/Sec](c)  AIMDCentralizedFig. 5.9 Comparisons on the costs of the two algorithms00:00 03:00 06:00 09:00 12:00 15:00 18:00 21:00 00:0010\u2212410\u2212310\u2212210\u22121100101102103Hour of the day [h]Communication costs [kBytes]  AIMD [5secs]Centralized [5mins]Centralized [5secs]Fig. 5.10 Comparisons on the communication costs of the two algorithms: with same stepsize, AIMD clearly outperforms the centralised approach.5.4 Case Studies 123generate enough thermal energy. All of the DERs in the network were modelled as constantP-Q generators with the same power factors equal to 1.0 to generate pure active power for theloads. We chose the capacity of each DER according to existing plants for which parameterswere available from [180]. In particular, the capacities of the wind plants were chosen as12.15MW, 13.5MW and 7.7MW, respectively. The capacities for the PV plants were selectedas 1.8MW and 2.1MW and the capacities for the CHPs were chosen as 24MW and 14MW.The fixed loads located around the CHPs were taken as 10MW and 5MW, respectively. Weassumed that the CHP were the only DERs able to produce thermal power, with a heat topower ratio equal to 1.0. In particular, the microgrid was sized to satisfy both the electricaland the thermal demand at any moment during the simulation.Fig. 5.11 Schematic topology of the tested network.In the simulation, we further assumed that each load has a power factor of 0.98 lagging,and load profiles were randomly chosen for a period of 24 hours from reference [165]. Loadsare located in the microgrid area at a random distance (uniformly distributed between 0.5kmand 1km) between each other. The maximum wind power output for each wind DER wasalso randomly chosen from real onshore wind turbine data from the National RenewableEnergy Laboratory (NREL) [141]. The maximum solar power generation profile of eachPV was computed according to a quadratic function with non-zero values from 6am to 6pm,randomly perturbed to simulate cloud disturbance, as described in Section 5.4.1. The realthermal power profile was referred from [152] and applied to the total thermal power demandin our simulation, proportionally to a maximum thermal peak of 18MW during the day. Theparameters of the utility functions were taken from [180] and [149] and are summarised in5.4 Case Studies 124Table 5.2 Parameters of the utility functionsPlant aeli beli celi athi bthi cthiWind Plant 1 0.0021 20.59 3.438 - - -Wind Plant 2 0.0021 19.54 3.440 - - -Wind Plant 3 0.0020 25.33 3.418 - - -Solar PV 1 0.0042 23.73 3.428 - - -Solar PV 2 0.0042 15.88 3.435 - - -CHP1 0.0064 39.22 4.011 0.0064 39.22 4.011CHP2 0.0062 33.84 4.024 0.0064 39.22 4.011Table 5.2. In particular, as the CHPs provide revenues due to thermal power generation, aheat credit is subtracted from total unit costs to establish an equivalent of the levelised costsof producing only electricity [180]. We sampled the load profiles and the maximum output ofthe DERs every 10 minutes, so that the values of pthi (k), pthi(k), peli (k), peli(k),dth(k),del(k)did actually change every 10 minutes.In this part we report the simulation results obtained by implementing the proposeddouble priority AIMD utility optimisation algorithm in the network described in Section5.4.2. We compared the distributed solution to the optimal centralised based solution forbetter evaluation of the performance of the proposed algorithm. The centralised solution iscomputed every 10 minutes, assuming that the EMS is informed of the maximum power thateach DER can provide and also of the power required by the users. We assumed that theEMS had the ability to solve the optimisation problem instantaneously and to schedule theoptimal power flows to the DERs. These are the same assumptions as we made in Section5.4.1. As for the AIMD implementation, each step of the algorithm iteration was set to 1second for a more accurate observation of the results. Figure 5.12 depicts the optimal share ofelectrical power generated by each available DER. Figure 5.13 shows that both a centralisedfull-communication and the proposed distributed algorithm manage to match supply anddemand of both electrical and thermal power. Figure 5.14 shows that both algorithms achievethe same minimum cost result. Finally, Figure 5.15 depicts the minimum and the maximumper-unit voltage in the network, as computed from the OpenDSS simulation environment. Itshould be noted that we assumed that all the DGs were allocated outside of the load centreand produced a large aggregated available power. For the sake of simplicity, we assumed thatthe required reactive power was taken from the external grid, and the figure only illustratesthe voltage impact on the grid in case no voltage control actions are taken.5.4 Case Studies 12500.00 04.00 08.00 12.00 16.00 20.00 00.00012345678910Time [hour of the day]Power [MW]  (a)Wind 1Wind 2Wind 3PV 1PV 2CHP 1CHP 2Fig. 5.12 Electrical power generation by each DER.00.00 04.00 08.00 12.00 16.00 20.00 00.000510152025303540Time [hour of the day]       power                        Power [MW](b)  Distributed Electrical PowerCentralised Electrical PowerDistributed Thermal PowerCentralised Thermal PowerFig. 5.13 Comparisons of the total power generation profile (both electrical and thermal) byapplying different algorithms.5.4 Case Studies 12600.00 04.00 08.00 12.00 16.00 20.00 00.000.10.120.140.160.180.20.220.240.260.28Time [hour of the day]Costs [Dollars/sec]  (c)AIMD CentralizedFig. 5.14 Comparisons of the costs by using the two algorithms.00.00 04.00 08.00 12.00 16.00 20.00 00.000.950.960.970.980.9911.011.021.031.041.05Time [hour of the day]Voltage [p.u.]  (d)Minimum voltageMaximum voltageFig. 5.15 Minimum and maximum voltage profiles in the network obtained with the twoalgorithms.5.5 Conclusions 1275.5 ConclusionsIn this chapter, we demonstrate a methodology for adapting the AIMD algorithm to solve autility optimisation problem in a microgrid scenario with DGs. The objective is to achievereal-time power balancing of DGs and the demand, and to decide how much energy should begenerated from the DGs, in a distributed manner, such that the total cost of energy productionfrom the DGs can be minimised. We show that our proposed distributed algorithms cansuccessfully solve the power generation problem in an optimal fashion, greatly reducingthe communication overhead required by centralised algorithms, even in the presence ofa second thermal constraint. In particular, power balancing is achieved without having tocommunicate real-time power availability from renewable resources (sun/wind), or the powerrequired by the users, but by simply notifying the DERs with a single bit of informationevery time the provided power equals the required power.Part IVDistributed and Privacy-Aware SpeedAdvisory SystemsChapter 6Intelligent Speed Advisory System forElectric VehiclesAbstract: In this chapter, we introduce a new application of the speed advisory system, usingideas from Chapter 2, for minimising energy consumption of a group of EVs in a city centrescenario. The performance of the system was evaluated through Matlab simulations. It is jointwork with Rodrigo Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez-Hurtado, Fabian Wirth, Yingqi Gu, Emanuele Crisostomi, andRobert Shorten. The original work presented in this chapter was submitted for publication in[112, 113].6.1 IntroductionAt present, Intelligent Speed Advisory (ISA) systems, which are a component of AdvancedDriver Assistance Systems (ADASs), have become a fundamental part of Intelligent Trans-portation Systems (ITS). Such systems offer many potential benefits, including improvedvehicle and pedestrian safety, better utilisation of the road network, and reduced emis-sions. Recently, many papers have appeared on this topic reflecting the problem from theviewpoint of road operators, infrastructure providers, and transportation solution providers[2, 11, 18, 24, 61, 80, 202, 216].In this chapter we consider the design of a Speed Advisory System (SAS) making useof vehicle-to-vehicle/infrastructure (V2X) technologies. In particular, we are interested insolving the speed advisory problem in the case that the fleet of vehicles is only composed ofEVs. Such a situation might occur in some sensitive areas in city centres that are closed toconventional traffic, and only allow transit to specific categories of low (or zero) pollutingvehicles, see for instance the case of umweltzonen [37] in Germany; or a similar problem6.2 Related Work 130might occur for a fleet of urban electric buses. The use of electric buses to decrease harmfulemissions and noise pollution is becoming widespread in different cities of the world, see forinstance the recent cases of S\u00e3o Paulo [140], Louisville in the US [82], or Wien in Europe[53].Our starting point is the observation that different EVs are designed to operate optimally(e.g., in terms of energy efficiency) at different vehicle speeds and at different loadingconditions. Thus, a recommended speed, or speed limit may be optimal for one vehicle andnot for others. Our objective in this chapter is to develop a SAS which allows groups of EVsto collaborate in order to find the optimal speed that should be recommended to all vehiclesbelonging to the fleet of EVs, in order to minimise the overall energy consumption of thefleet; or similarly, to extend their range. We shall assume that EVs are equipped with V2Xtechnologies, and can exchange information with their neighbours and can exchange limitedinformation with the infrastructure.Clearly, this task is performed provided that some basic safety and Quality of Service(QoS) requirements are guaranteed (i.e., the optimal recommended speed should be within areasonable realistic range). As we shall see later, the optimal speed heavily depends on howsingle EVs travel in traffic (e.g., whether air conditioning is on/off and how many people areon-board). Since people might not be interested in sharing such private pieces of information(i.e. privacy-preserving), we are interested in obtaining the optimal solution without requiringsingle vehicles to communicate personal information to other vehicles or even to centralinfrastructure. We shall show that one can design, using simple ideas from cooperativecontrol techniques1, an effective SAS in a manner that preserves the privacy of individualvehicles. Matlab simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.This chapter is organised as follows: Section 6.2 gives a brief review of some relatedwork in literature; Section 6.3 describes the mathematical model and proposes the algorithmfor solving the optimisation problem; Section 6.4 evaluates the performance of the algorithmsusing Matlab simulations; Section 6.5 concludes the chapter.6.2 Related WorkIn this section, we give a brief review of some related work. First note that a detailed review ofthis topic is given in [147]. Conventional systems are described in [2, 56, 80, 134, 202]. Thesepapers describe various aspects of the ISA design process. This includes the design of driver1A similar approach was proposed in Section 4.3 for solving the optimal fair V2G power dispatch problemin a microgrid scenario. In this chapter, we adapt the previously proposed methods for minimising the energyconsumption of group of EVs in an ITS scenario (e.g. short distances travelling in city centres). In the nextchapter, we explore the application of the approach to fleets of conventional vehicles in a highway scenario.6.3 Model and Algorithm 131display systems, the incorporation of external environmental information, and the algorithmicaspects of speed and distance recommendations. Recently, there has been a strong trend toalso include traffic density information. References [59, 146, 147, 166, 203, 209] describework in this direction. In these works density information is included in the procedure via loopdetectors or via explicit density estimation via Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) technology. Thedifferentiating feature of the approach followed in this thesis is that density and compositionof the vehicle fleet is also used, but in an implicit manner as part of the optimisation algorithm.Finally, we note that there is a huge body of work on cooperative control of vehicles andits connection to consensus algorithms [30, 52, 85, 134]. It is important to note that weare designing a SAS and not a cooperative control system. This distinction is important asit allows us to ignore string stability effects which are a fundamental limitation of manycooperative control architectures [77, 93, 96, 198].6.3 Model and AlgorithmIn this section, we describe the cost functions to represent energy consumption in EVs. Afterthat, we present the problem statement and give the mathematical model for the scenario ofinterest. Finally, we propose an algorithm to solve the optimisation problem.6.3.1 Cost FunctionsWe illustrate a basic model of power consumption in EVs. Such a model will be requiredto formulate a cost function that relates the travelling speed with the energy efficiency inthe later problem statement section. Most of the discussion here follows the reference [204],where the ranges of EVs are reported for different brands and under different driving cycles.Power consumption in an EV driving at a steady-state speed (along a flat road) is causedmainly by four sources:\u2022 Aerodynamics power losses: they are proportional to the cube of the speed of the EV,and depend on other parameters typical of a single vehicle such as its frontal area andthe drag coefficient (which in turn, depends on the shape of the vehicle).\u2022 Drivetrain losses: they result from the process of converting energy in the battery intotorque at the wheels of the car. Their computation is not simple, as losses might occurat different levels (in the inverter, in the induction motor, gears, etc); in some cases,these power losses have been modelled as a third-order polynomial of speed, whoseparameters have been obtained by fitting experimental data (see [204]).6.3 Model and Algorithm 132\u2022 Tires: the power required to overcome the rolling distance depends on the weight ofthe vehicle (and thus, on the number of passengers as well), and is proportional to thespeed of the vehicle.\u2022 Ancillary systems: this category includes all other electrical loads in the vehicle, suchas Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems, external lights, audiosystem, battery cooling systems, etc. Here, the power consumption does not dependon the speed of the vehicle and can be represented by a constant term that dependson external factors (e.g., weather conditions) and personal choices (desired indoortemperature, volume of the radio, etc). According to experimental evaluations [204],the power losses due to ancillary services usually vary between 0.2 and 2.2 kW.Thus, by summing up all the previous terms, the power consumption Pcons can berepresented as a function of the speed v asPconsv=\u03b10v+\u03b11+\u03b12v+\u03b13v2, (6.1)where the left hand side is divided by the speed in order to obtain an indication of energyconsumption per km, expressed in kWh/km. Such a unit of measurement is usually employedin energy-efficiency evaluations, and we shall assume that each EV i will use (6.1) as itspersonal cost function, denoted by fi (vi) =\u03b1i0vi+\u03b1i1 +\u03b1i2vi +\u03b1i3v2i . Accordingly, Figure 6.1shows a possible relationship between speed and power consumption, obtained using datafrom the Tesla Roadster and assuming a low power consumption for ancillary services of0.56 kW (i.e., assuming air conditioning switched off). As can be noted from Figure 6.1,there is large energy consumption at large speeds due to the fact that power increases withthe cube of the speed for aerodynamic reasons; however, it is also large for low speeds, dueto the fact that travel times increase and, accordingly, constant power required by ancillaryservices demands more energy than the same services delivered with high speeds.6.3.2 Problem StatementWe consider a scenario in which a number of EVs are travelling in a city centre. Let Ndenote the total number of EVs driving on the road where the ISA broadcast signal can bereceived. Each EV is equipped with a specific communication device (e.g. a mobile phonewith access to WiFi/3G networks) so that it is able to receive/transmit messages from/toeither nearby EVs or available road infrastructure (e.g. a base station). We assume that eachEV can communicate a limited amount of information with the infrastructure, and that the6.3 Model and Algorithm 133Fig. 6.1 A typical individual cost function.infrastructure can broadcast information to the entire network of EVs, and each EV can senda broadcast signal to its neighbours.For convenience, we assume that all EVs have access to a common clock (for example, aGPS clock). Let k \u2208 {1,2,3, ...} be a discrete time instant in which new information from EVsis collected and new speed recommendations are made. Let si (k) be the recommended speedof the EV i \u2208 N := {1,2, ...,N } calculated at time instant k. Thus, the vector of recommendedspeeds for all EVs is given by s (k)T := [s1 (k) , s2 (k) , ..., sN (k)], where the superscript Trepresents the transposition of the vector. Note that between two consecutive time instants(k, k +1), the recommended speeds are constant while the driving speeds are time-varyingreal-valued variables. We denote by N ik the set of neighbours of EV i at time instant k, i.e.those EVs which can successfully broadcast their recommended speeds to EV i.In addition, we assume that each EV i can evaluate a function fi that determines its aver-age energy consumption, were it to be travelling at the recommended speed si (k), accordingto (6.1). Note that in order to achieve this, it is necessary that the vehicle both knows itsparameters in the function, and also monitors the functioning of some electric appliances onboard (e.g., the intensity of the HVAC system or whether the radio is switched on or not). Wefurther assume that these functions are strictly convex, continuously differentiable and with aLipschitz continuous first derivative f \u2032i which is assumed with positive bounded growth ratein the domain of interest D. We assume that the recommended speed can vary within thedomain D = [5, . . .,130], which is a realistic range of speeds, expressed in km/h. Then therequirement on the derivative can be expressed as0 < dimin \u2264f \u2032i (a)\u2212 f \u2032i (b)a\u2212 b \u2264 dimax, (6.2)6.3 Model and Algorithm 134for all a,b \u2208 D (i.e. for reasonable steady-state speeds) such that a,b, and suitable positiveconstants dimin, dimax. Notice that (6.1) fulfils all the previous requirements, and thus, theprevious assumptions are usually satisfied in the application of interest here. In this context,we consider the following problem.Problem 1: Design an ISA system for a fleet of EVs, following a common speed such as aspeed limit, connected via V2X communication systems, such that the total energy consump-tion from all EVs can be minimised by all of them following the same reference speed.The optimisation problem that needs to be solved in order to address Problem 1 can beformulated as follows:mins\u2208RN\u2211j\u2208Nf j(s j),s.t. si = s j, \u2200i , j \u2208 N.(6.3)This problem is an optimised consensus problem and can be solved in a variety of ways(for example using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) [15, 45, 173]).Our focus in this work is not to construct a fully distributed solution to this problem, butrather to construct a partially distributed solution which allows rapid convergence to theoptimum, without requiring the vehicles to exchange information that reveals individual costfunctions to other EVs. This is the privacy preserving component of our problem statement.Comment: Note that in addressing Problem 1 we are not trying to calculate the recom-mended speed for all the EVs in one step. Rather we propose an iterative algorithm that ineach step yields individual recommended speeds that will eventually converge to the samevalue on the consensus constraints. Thus, our objective for the minimisation problem (6.3) isto seek the optimal solution of the recommended speeds under a consensus constraint. Indoing this, we shall assume that the EVs will be compliant with the recommended speed (thismight be more realistic for public transportation rather than single EVs, but non-compliancewith the recommended speed is not investigated here and left for future work).To solve (6.3) we recall the previously discussed optimisation problem (4.18) and The-orem 9 in Section 4.3.3. In a similar way to (4.21), we use the iterative feedback schemes (k +1) = P (k) s (k)+G (s (k)) e, (6.4)6.4 Experimental Results 135for finding the optimal solution s\u2217 of the problem (6.3). To apply Theorem 9 to solve (6.3),we adopt the same definition of P(k), as suggested in (4.13), for modelling the time-varyingand strongly connected communication topology.Comment: The assumption of uniform strong ergodicity holds if the neighbourhood graphassociated to the problem has suitable connectedness properties. If sufficiently many carstravel in the city centre area, it is reasonable to expect that this graph is strongly connectedat most time instances. Weaker assumptions are possible but we do not discuss them herein this chapter; see [133] for possible assumptions in this context. In any case, note that thetime-varying communication graph makes the dynamic system (6.4) a switching system.Now, we propose the Optimal Decentralised Consensus Algorithm for solving (6.3) asshown in Algorithm 11. The underlying assumption here is that at all time instants all EVscommunicate their value f \u2032j(s j (k))to the base station, which reports the aggregate sumback to all EVs. This is precisely the privacy preserving aspect of the algorithm, as EVs donot have to reveal their cost functions to the base station, nor to other EVs. Some implicitinformation (i.e., the derivatives of the cost function at certain speeds) is indeed revealed tothe base station but not to any other EVs involved in the fleet.Algorithm 11 Optimal Decentralised Consensus Algorithm for SAS1: for k = 1,2,3, .. do2: for each i \u2208 N do3: Get F\u02dc (k) =\u2211j\u2208Nf \u2032j(s j (k))from the base station.4: Get s j (k) from all neighbours j \u2208 N ik .5: Do qi (k) = \u03b7i \u00b7 \u2211j\u2208N ik(s j (k)\u2212 si (k)).6: Do si (k +1) = si (k)+ qi (k)\u2212 \u00b5 \u00b7 F\u02dc (k).7: end for8: end forComment: We note that in any real implementation in a city centre scenario the recom-mended speed may be bounded above and below by the road operator.6.4 Experimental ResultsWe now give some preliminary results obtained in Matlab simulations. Our objective in thissection is to show that the recommended speed is in fact more energy efficient than some6.4 Experimental Results 136Fig. 6.2 The cost functions for the 100 EVs.other speeds. For this purpose, we assume that a fleet of 100 EVs travels in the city centrefor an hour, and adopt the following driving profiles:\u2022 In the first 20 minutes, the vehicles travel at the optimal speed calculated from Algo-rithm 11.\u2022 In the second 20 minutes, they travel at a speed lower than the optimal speed.\u2022 In the last 20 minutes, they travel at a speed higher than the optimal speed.In the first stage we assume that the communication graph among the EVs changes ina random way, i.e., at each time step an EV receives information from a subset of vehiclesbelonging to the fleet. This is a simplifying assumption that can be justified by assumingthat in principle all EVs might communicate to all the other EVs (i.e., they are relativelyclose), but some communications might fail due to obstacles, shadowing effects, externalnoise, or other. For this purpose, the time-varying communication graph at each time stepin our simulation was modelled by a sequence of strongly ergodic row-stochastic matrices.Besides, in the two last stages we assume that the change of speed occurs instantaneously,since there is no requirement to iteratively compute an optimal speed.We tuned our parameters in Algorithm 11 as \u03b7 = \u00b5 = 0.001, and we simulate differentcost functions for each EV by assuming a random number of people inside each car (between1 and 5 people) with an average weight of 80 kg, and by assuming a different consumptionfrom ancillary services within the typical range of [0.2,2.2] kW. The curves of the costfunctions used in our experiment are shown in Figure 6.2. The evolution of the speeds of theEVs are shown in Figure 6.3a and the average energy consumption is shown in Figure 6.3b.6.4 Experimental Results 137(a) Evolution of the vehicles\u2019 speeds.(b) Evolution of the overall energy loss..Fig. 6.3 Simulation results for the network of EVs: Algorithm 11 is applied until time 0.33 h,and then two different speeds (below and above the optimal one) are suggested in [0.33,0.66]h and [0.66,1] h, respectively.6.5 Conclusions 138As is shown in Figure 6.3a, the proposed ISA system converges quickly to consensusand the optimal solution. This solution indeed minimises the group energy consumption of afleet of EVs effectively as can be seen from Figure 6.3b.6.5 ConclusionsIn this chapter we present a new ISA system. The system is based on a solution to anoptimisation consensus problem as we previously discussed in Section 4.3.3. We show thatthe ISA can be designed, in a privacy-preserving manner, to improve the overall energyefficiency of EVs or, in other words, to collaboratively extend the travelling range of EVs.From the grid perspective, this system also provides benefits by reducing the power loadingdue to an increasing number of EVs charging on the grid.Preliminary results have been presented in the chapter through Matlab simulations. In thenext chapter, we shall demonstrate that, by using the same ideas, one can design an effectiveISA system to minimise emissions for conventional vehicles networks. Extensive simulations,using the realistic traffic simulator software package SUMO, and a dedicated hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing platform, are given to illustrate the effectiveness of deploying ourproposed framework.Chapter 7Intelligent Speed Advisory System forConventional VehiclesAbstract: In this chapter, we extend our previous discussion in Chapter 6 to the case of afleet of conventional vehicles1. We show that, by using the ideas developed in Chapter 6,group emissions of vehicles can be minimised. The performance of the system was evaluatedthrough a variety of simulations. It is joint work with Rodrigo Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez-Hurtado, FabianWirth, Yingqi Gu, Emanuele Crisostomi, and Robert Shorten. The work presented in thischapter has been submitted for publication in [67, 112].7.1 IntroductionIn this chapter we are interested in solving the speed advisory problem in the case that the fleetof vehicles is composed of conventional vehicles. Our starting point is the observation thatdifferent vehicle classes (e.g., in terms of emission levels) are designed to operate optimallyat different vehicle speeds and at different loading conditions. Thus, as we previouslymentioned, a recommended speed, or speed limit may be optimal for one vehicle and not forothers. Given a stretch of road network, the group emissions (CO, CO2, NOx , O3, PM10,PM2.5) may or may not be close to the theoretically minimum possible. This of coursedepends on the composition of traffic on a given road, and the average speed at which vehiclesare travelling.Clearly, the previously designed Algorithm 11 needs to be adapted when applied to afleet of conventional vehicles. First, in terms of field of application, conventional vehicles1We consider conventional vehicles as those vehicles using diesel or petrol engines that can generatepollutant emissions through exhaust pipes. In the following context, we shall use the word \u201cvehicles\u201d, unlessotherwise noted, for describing \u201cconventional vehicles\u201d.7.2 Problem Statement 140can be used for longer travelling distances while EVs are typically used for short distancesdue to their reduced driving ranges, and thus EVs are most likely deployed in city centresor short-distance commuting areas while conventional vehicles are usually applied for long-distance travelling purposes (e.g. highway scenario); second, the emissions caused by EVsare usually little and can be considered equal to zero (if the batteries can be completelycharged by renewable energy resources), while conventional vehicles have different emissionlevels according to their vehicle types, weights, forms of fuel, engine sizes etc. Accordingly,in the following we shall show how the previous framework can be adapted to the case of afleet of conventional vehicles, with the objective of minimising the group emission on a givenstretch of road in a highway scenario. Another contribution of this chapter is to evaluatethe algorithm through extensive simulation studies. In particular, SUMO simulations aregiven to illustrate the efficacy of the algorithm in a more realistic traffic scenario (comparedto Matlab simulations), and Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) tests involving real vehicles aregiven to illustrate user acceptability and ease of the algorithm deployment.The remainder of the chapter is organised as follows: Section 7.2 briefly describes theproblem statement and presents the cost functions for modelling the emission generation ofvehicles. Section 7.3 illustrates the simulation results. Section 7.4 concludes the chapter.7.2 Problem StatementWe consider a scenario in which a number of vehicles are driving along a given stretch ofhighway with several lanes in the same direction. Note that the assumption on different lanesof the highway allows vehicles to overtake whenever it is appropriate. We wish to find acommon recommended speed, by using the same ISA system or, Algorithm 11, suggested inChapter 6, to minimise the total emissions from all vehicles taking account of the compositionof the vehicles (individual vehicle types) and the number of vehicles. We assume that vehiclesare connected via V2X communication systems, and are able to evaluate its personal costfunction in terms of speed and emission generation, such that the total emissions from allvehicles can be minimised by all of them following the same recommended speed.To apply the algorithm in this new scenario, we shall adapt the average-speed modelproposed in [14] to model each cost function fi as a function of the average speed si asfi = k*,a+bsi + cs2i +ds3i + es4i + fs5i +gs6isi+-, (7.1)where a,b,c,d,e, f,g,k \u2208 R are used to specify different levels of emissions by different classesof vehicles.7.3 Evaluation using SUMO Simulations 1417.3 Evaluation using SUMO SimulationsWe now evaluate the algorithm for the scenario of interest here using the SUMO simulator[12], and by implementing it in a real vehicle. We conduct the following experiments:1. First, we compare, for a given scenario, the optimal speed with a non-optimum speedlimit. In this simulation, for illustration purposes, we force all vehicles to travel at therecommended speeds, subject to implementation constraints coming from the SUMOsimulation (e.g. acceleration/deceleration profiles).2. We then make the first scenario more realistic by allowing vehicles to travel in a smallrange around the recommended speed.3. We then give a simulation which is dynamic in nature. Cars enter/leave the simulationdynamically and over a long stretch of road we allow vehicles to travel as they wishwith a broad range of constant speeds. For example, this may represent a highwaysituation where the traffic flow is moving better in one lane than in another.4. We then give a hardware-in-the-loop simulation with a real target vehicle travelling ona road and an emulated network with a fixed number of simulated vehicles.The idea in all situations is to show the benefits of Algorithm 11. In the simulations weuse the emission profiles from [14] shown in Table 7.1 and Figure 7.1, corresponding topetrol cars/minibuses with up to 2.5 tons of gross vehicle mass. Besides, we also use thefollowing vehicle types:\u2022 Type 1: accel. 2.15 m/s2, decel. 5.5 m/s2, length 4.54 m.\u2022 Type 2: accel. 1.22 m/s2, decel. 5.0 m/s2, length 4.51 m.\u2022 Type 3: accel. 1.75 m/s2, decel. 6.1 m/s2, length 4.45 m.\u2022 Type 4: accel. 2.45 m/s2, decel. 6.1 m/s2, length 4.48 m.7.3.1 SUMO Simulations with a Fixed Number of VehiclesIn this experiment we consider 40 vehicles travelling along a highway. The set-up for this setof experiments is as follows.\u2022 Road: A straight 5 km long highway with 4 lanes in the same direction.\u2022 Duration of the simulation: 1000 s.7.3 Evaluation using SUMO Simulations 142\u2022 Algorithm sampling interval: \u2206T = 1s.\u2022 Switch-on time: the algorithm is activated at time 500 s.The results of the experiments are given in Figure 7.2 and Figure 7.3. As can we seefrom Figure 7.2a, making a small change in the recommended speed yields an about 3%improvement in CO2 emissions. We then repeat the experiment and allow vehicles to travelin a range around the recommended speed, and the results of this are given in Figure 7.2b.As can we see from Figure 7.2b, also in this case a significant reduction in CO2 emission canbe observed. Finally to conclude, we applied the algorithm to a situation where the cars havea different range of emission profiles and with a different range of speeds. The results aregiven in Figure 7.3. In this case, as can be seen in Figure 7.3, a reduction of up to 8.07% canbe obtained by following the recommended speed. To illustrate what this means in termsof grams of carbon, SUMO predicts that these forty vehicles emit an average of 9407 g/kmcompared with 8816 g/km when travelling at an optimised speed. This represents a saving ofabout 591 g/km which integrates over a day into a significant carbon saving.Table 7.1 Emission factors for some CO2 emission profiles reported in [14].Profile Codes a b c d e,f,g kR007 2.2606E+3 3.1583E+1 2.9263E-1 3.0199E-3 0 1R016 3.7473E+3 1.9576E+2 -8.5270E-1 1.0318E-2 0 1R017 3.7473E+3 1.8600E+2 -8.5270E-1 1.0318E-2 0 1R018 3.7473E+3 1.6774E+2 -8.5270E-1 1.0318E-2 0 1R019 3.7473E+3 1.5599E+2 -8.5270E-1 1.0318E-2 0 1R021 3.7473E+3 1.0571E+2 -8.5270E-1 1.0318E-2 0 17.3.2 SUMO Simulations with a Dynamic Number of VehiclesWe now consider a dynamic scenario. To do this we partitioned the highway into threeconsecutive sections L1, L2 and L3. We then proceed as follows. First, vehicles enter theuncontrolled section L1, with constant speed (randomly chosen in a given range); aftercompleting L1, vehicles enter the section L2. On section L2 vehicles calculate and followa recommended speed. After completing L2 they enter section L3 and on this section theytravel freely (the same speeds as they were on L1). The experiments are setup as follows.\u2022 Road: three consecutive straight edges:\u2013 L1: 5 km long highway with 4 lanes, uncontrolled;7.3 Evaluation using SUMO Simulations 143Fig. 7.1 Curves for the CO2 emission profiles in Table 7.1.\u2013 L2: 5 km long highway with 4 lanes, ISA controlled;\u2013 L3: 5 km long highway with 4 lanes, uncontrolled.\u2022 Total number of cars: 650, with uniform distribution of both emission profiles amongR016, R017, R018 and R019, and uniform distribution of types of vehicles.\u2022 Vehicular flow entering L1: one new car every 2 seconds until simulation time 1300 s.\u2022 Length of simulation: 3010 s.\u2022 Window size for the calculation of the moving average (MA) of CO2 emissions forvisualisation purposes: 500 time steps.\u2022 Travelling speeds for cars on L1 are randomly chosen with uniform distribution in 3scenarios:\u2013 Case 1, constant speeds in (80,100) km/h.\u2013 Case 2, constant speeds in (60,80) km/h.\u2013 Case 3, constant speeds in (40,60) km/h.7.3 Evaluation using SUMO Simulations 144(a) All vehicles with constant speed 80 km/h until time 500 s, and following the recommended speedprecisely after time 500 s.(b) All vehicles with constant speed in the range (72,88) km/h until time 500 s, and following therecommended speed with a maximum variation tolerance of 10% after time 500 s.Fig. 7.2 Results of the SUMO simulation for the static case, before and after the activation ofthe algorithm at time step 500 s. Setup: 40 vehicles, of which 32 are of emission type R007and 8 are of emission profile R021, and uniform distribution of types of vehicles.7.3 Evaluation using SUMO Simulations 145Fig. 7.3 Results of the SUMO simulation for the static case, before and after the activation ofthe algorithm at time step 500 s. Setup: 40 vehicles, with uniform distribution of emissionprofile among R016, R017, R018 and R019, and uniform distribution of types of vehicles.Note that even though this is a dynamic situation, the vehicle density on each part of theroad becomes constant after a certain time. A sample of simulation results is given in Figure7.4, which reveals what might be expected from the initial experiments, namely, the furthervehicles are away from the optimal speed, the more that is gained by deploying the ISA.To complete the section, we conducted one hundred random experiments for each of thethree cases described above. In each experiment, we collected the simulation data of the totalCO2 emission generation on each section of the highway from SUMO. Table 7.2 summarisesthe aggregated results of this exercise, and clearly demonstrate the benefits of the ISA.Table 7.2 General results: total emissions per lane.Total Emissions of CO2 \u2217 [grams]L1 (Uncontrolled) L2 (Controlled) ImprovementCase Mean \u03c3 Mean \u03c3 Mean \u03c31 2639012.7 1498.38 2587629.4 268.2 1.95% 0.05%2 2600710.6 606.87 2583472.8 178.3 0.66% 0.02%3 2787810.6 4200.36 2586943.9 169.9 7.20% 0.14%\u2217 Sum of emissions at every time step (i.e. time integration).Mean: average of 100 different measurements.\u03c3: standard deviation.Comment: Note that it is clearly the case that parameters of the algorithm have the potentialto affect emission savings. For example, the speed of convergence of the algorithm affectsthe rate of which the emissions are saved.7.3 Evaluation using SUMO Simulations 146Fig. 7.4 Example for case 3: 500 time-step MA of CO2 emissions for a set of initial speedsin the range (40,60) [km/h].Comment: Note that the solution that we have obtained is optimal for the environment andfor the collective, e.g., in terms of overall reduced emissions. However, the solution might beunfair for some single users who would be recommended to drive at a different speed thanoriginally desired. One way to improve fairness could be to decrease road taxes for virtuousvehicles, to compensate them for the inconvenience caused by the dirty vehicles in terms ofrecommended average speeds.7.3.3 Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) EmulationFinally, to provide a sense of how this system might function from a driver\u2019s perspectivewe now describe a hardware-in-the-loop implementation of the algorithm. Specifically, weuse a SUMO-based Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) emulation platform that was developed atthe Hamilton Institute [64, 65]. This emulation platform uses the open source road trafficsimulator to emulate a real environment and generate virtual cars, along with a dedicatedcommunication architecture supported by TraCI (a Python script implementing a TPC-basedclient/server architecture) to provide on-line access to SUMO, a smartphone connected to the3G network and running the plug-in SumoEmbed (designed for use with Torque Pro [75],and a OBD-II adaptor [155] to embed a real car into the simulation, as shown in Figure7.5. The idea then is to allow the driver, driving a real vehicle on real streets, to experience7.3 Evaluation using SUMO Simulations 147being connected to a network of emulated vehicles driving along the same road network.Specifically, we performed this experiment by driving a Toyota Prius on a single-lane streetcircuit in the North Campus of the Maynooth University, while the Prius is embedded intoa HIL emulation and represented by an avatar which interacts with the avatars of 29 othervirtual (simulated) vehicles driving along the same stretch of (emulated) road.Fig. 7.5 Schematic of the HIL emulation platform.The experiment begins when the simulation is started on the workstation and the servercomponent of the Python script waits for a call from the OBD-II connected smartphone inthe real vehicle. Since the selected street circuit only has one lane, the vehicles are releasedsequentially from the same starting point. The avatar representing the Prius departs in thesixth position. Once the connection between the Prius and the workstation is established, theposition and speed of the Prius\u2019 avatar are updated using real-time information from the Priusvia the OBD-II adaptor. From the point of view of the ISA algorithm, the Prius is regardedas a normal agent in the SUMO simulation, i.e. treated just like any other simulated vehicle.The consensus algorithm for the proposed ISA system is embedded in the main componentPython script. Thus, once the respective recommended speeds are calculated, they are sentto the vehicles via the server component and the cellular network to the smartphone in thecase of the Prius, and via TraCI commands in the case of the other vehicles in the simulation.Note here that the driver behaviour is different for a simulated car compared to the case ofthe Prius: while we force each simulated vehicle to follow the recommended speed as far aspossible2, the Prius\u2019 driver is allowed to either follow or ignore the speed recommendation(displayed on the smartphone\u2019s screen) as desired.2Concerning mainly the interaction between vehicles and the design parameters for the simulated cars suchas acceleration, deceleration, car following model or driver information.7.3 Evaluation using SUMO Simulations 148The HIL experiment is setup as follows.\u2022 Length of the experiment: 600 s, of which the ISA algorithm is only engaged at aroundtime 300 s;\u2022 Total number of cars: 30, with uniform distribution of emission profiles among R016,R017, R018 and R019, and uniform distribution of types of vehicles, with a maximumspeed of 100 km/h.\u2022 The sampling time interval \u2206T for collecting new information and updating the recom-mendations is 1 s.Results of the experiment are depicted in Figure 7.6 and Figure 7.7. Figure 7.6 showsthat in the turned-off stage of the ISA system (i.e. the first 300 seconds), the overall CO2emissions increase almost linearly until all 30 vehicles are added to the emulation (at around130 s). From this point, it can be observed that the total emissions oscillate around anaverage peak value of 713 g/km. Again from Figure 7.6, we can observe that the overallCO2 emissions reduce significantly once the the ISA algorithm is switched on, to an averageof 475 g/km. In Figure 7.7 (top), a comparison between the evolution of the Prius\u2019 drivingand recommended speeds is presented. As can be observed, the recommended speed can beeasily followed by the driver.Fig. 7.6 Evolution of the overall CO2 emissions. The algorithm was turned on around time300 s.7.4 Conclusions 149````Fig. 7.7 Evolution of some variables along the whole HIL simulation. Top: related speeds forthe Prius (the 6th car), and Bottom: the related speeds for the 7h car (just behind the Prius).The algorithm was turned on around time 300 s.7.4 ConclusionsIn this chapter, we extended our previous discussions in Chapter 6 to determining the optimalspeeds that should be followed by a fleet of conventional vehicles working to collaborativelyreduce their emission generation. This idea has been implemented by adopting Algorithm11 in Chapter 6, for the new cost functions of interest here. We show that the previouslyproposed ISA system can be implemented in a manner that accounts for vehicle density andcomposition, and that it is provably convergent (Theorem 9).SUMO simulations and HIL emulations are given to illustrate the efficacy and accept-ability of the algorithm. Finally, the algorithm has been implemented in a real productionvehicle using nothing more than a smartphone and a commercially available OBD-II plug-in.Chapter 8Conclusions and Future WorkAbstract: In this chapter, we summarise our work in each chapter of the thesis. We also givesome suggestions for potential directions for future research.8.1 SummaryThis thesis discusses the theoretical and application aspects of several distributed controltechniques in the context of EVs, smart grid and smart transportation systems. We haveprovided a rigorous proof of the stability properties of a recently proposed consensus systemwith feedback, developed customised decentralised algorithms for a variety of practicalapplications and evaluated their performance with the aid of detailed simulation studies.To motivate our discussion, we presented the background information on several relatedtopics, arising from the deployment of EVs and the construction of the smart grid and smarttransportation systems, in Chapter 1. These topics were classified into four main parts. In thefirst part, we introduced a useful mathematical algorithm that forms the basis for a number ofcontrol algorithms developed in other chapters. In the second and third parts, we consideredEV related problems in the context of the smart grid. In the final part, we considered theapplications of EVs interacting with a smart transportation system. In each part presented, wepointed out the challenges of the problems and highlighted the objectives and contributionsof our work.8.1.1 A Consensus Algorithm with FeedbackIn Part I we discussed a class of recently proposed consensus algorithm with nonlinearfeedback. The distributed algorithm is attractive since it has been widely used for solving8.1 Summary 151many application problems which require collaborative behaviours among agents to achievesome common goals. However, a rigorous analysis of the stability and convergence propertiesof the system has not been presented to date in the literature. In Chapter 2 we further studiedthe algorithm by establishing its relations with a Lure system, and explored certain conditionson the feedback functions so that the global convergence of the system can be assured. Thisis the main mathematical contributions of the thesis.8.1.2 Grid Integration with EVsIn Part II we discussed topics related to grid integration with EVs. In Chapter 3 we investi-gated a variety of charging strategies to achieve coordination among EVs for different goals.The charging strategies were implemented on EVs, assuming no V2G capabilities, in typicallow-voltage distribution networks (residential and SME areas). We began the chapter bypresenting a comprehensive literature review on different EV charging strategies from theview point of EV consumers, DSOs and TSOs. Motivated by these wide variety of algorithmsavailable for EV charging, we presented a common mathematical framework for formulatingdifferent EV charging problems that incorporates both power system and charging infras-tructure constraints and caters for both instantaneous and temporal optimisation objectives.With this framework in place, different EV charging algorithms including decentralised andcentralised and continuously and on-off based implementations, have been evaluated andcompared using a realistic distribution network simulation. The results demonstrate that theenhanced AIMD, DPF, and distributed on-off charging algorithms, which cater for both gridconstraints and communication overhead problems, provide an effective solution for chargingof EVs offering significant benefits to both EV owners and utility companies. At the end ofthe chapter, we have also presented the design of a distributed wireless testbed for chargingmobile phone batteries to physically evaluate the performance of the proposed distributedalgorithms.In Chapter 4 we investigated two V2G applications for providing effective ancillaryservices to the grid in different scenarios. In the first application we showed that by harnessingthe power of V2G technologies, group of EVs could be used to balance both active andreactive power across the 3 phases, thus reducing current imbalance. To do this, we proposeda distributed consensus control framework and algorithms to deliver the required coordinationin an efficient manner via EV charging/discharging. The proposed solution seeks to regulateEV charging in order to achieve equalised active power consumption across phases, whileat the same time preventing overloading of the grid, and coordinating discharging activitiesof EVs so as to cancel out the reactive power consumption on the grid. Simulation resultsusing realistic power system simulations have confirmed the efficacy of the consensus control8.1 Summary 152algorithm and have demonstrated, in particular, that provided a sufficient number of EVsare connected to the grid a substantial positive impact can be achieved. To the best of ourknowledge, this is the first time that a distributed consensus algorithm has been employedwith EVs to address current imbalance issues.In the second application, we considered a scenario in which a group of EVs wereconnecting to the grid providing fair and optimal power dispatch in a microgrid. Our startingpoint in this application is the observation that the surplus renewable energy generatedfrom the microgrid can be used to charge the EVs when they are not in use, and that theenergy can be returned to the grid if the battery charge is maintained above a minimumthreshold. With this in mind, we modelled this problem in an optimisation frameworkwhere utility functions are used to take account of economic term and QoS trade-offs, andformulated this problem with consensus constraints in terms of fair power dispatch of EVs.This optimisation problem has been solved using an iterative feedback algorithm derivedfrom the system discussed in Chapter 2, taking account of practical grid constraints. Finally,we demonstrated the performance of the proposed algorithm, considering practical gridconstraints, through realistic grid simulations. In this application, we have shown thatthe proposed iterative consensus algorithm can be used to solve optimisation consensusproblems if certain conditions on the feedback signal can be satisfied. This is one of the maincontributions of the thesis.8.1.3 Optimal Energy Management StrategiesIn Part III we discussed optimal energy management strategies in the context of the smartgrid. In Chapter 5 we started the discussion by considering a fundamental power balancingproblem in a microgrid connected with DERs. We have shown that the balancing objective ischallenging due to a number of factors, e.g., the uncertain power supply, the uncertain energyoffer, and the difficulties with designing an effective algorithm for real-time implementation inthe EMS. In contrast to many conventional centralised based energy management strategies,our objective was to design an algorithm that automatically shares the power generation taskamong the available DERs in a way that is fair and distributed. To this end, we showedthat one can design, using simple ideas based on AIMD, an effective distributed energymanagement system to achieve the above objective, without having to communicate real-timepower availability from renewable resources, or the power required by the users, but bysimply notifying the DERs with a single bit of information every time the provided powerequals the required power. We have shown the proposed AIMD-like algorithm performs inpractice as well as a centralised full-communication algorithm in simulations. In addition,we also showed that thermal energy requirements can be further included in the microgrid8.1 Summary 153operation by simply extending the algorithm for double power balancing requirements, andwe presented simulation studies to validate the proposed method.To conclude this part, we have demonstrated that the basic ideas of AIMD can be easilyextended to solve optimisation problems with linear capacity constraints. Our approach wasbased on achieving consensus on the first derivatives of the utility functions (with convexity).The power balancing constraint was satisfied by applying the basic congestion solvingmechanisms based on synchronised AIMD (i.e. broadcasting balancing notifications to theentire network). We have shown that the proposed AIMD-like approach can be implementedin a distributed manner with little communication overhead and control requirements for theEMS. This is the main contribution in Part III.8.1.4 Distributed and Privacy-Aware Speed Advisory SystemsIn the final part of the thesis we proposed a consensus based distributed speed advisorysystem that optimally determines a recommended common speed for a given area in orderthat the total emissions, or total battery energy consumptions of a group of EVs is minimised.In Chapter 6 we showed how to design a distributed speed advisory system to minimisebattery energy consumptions of a group of EVs in a city centre scenario. We formulatedthis design problem in a similar fashion to the optimisation problem introduced in Chapter4. We showed that by adapting mathematical algorithms from Chapter 2, an effective SAScan be designed to maximise the energy efficiency of a group of EVs in a privacy-preservingmanner. The proposed SAS provides an effective solution for EV owners, transportationsystem operators, and the grid companies. From the perspective of EV owners, the SASmaximises the energy efficiency of the group of EVs, thus extending their total travellingrange. From the perspective of the transportation system, the consensus recommendedspeed signal would be helpful in smoothing traffic flow and thus reducing traffic congestion.From the perspective of the grid companies, the proposed SAS would effectively reduce theincreasing energy requirements associated with EV charging, which helps to mitigate theheavy loading situation on the grid.The proposed SAS concept was extended in Chapter 7 to support minimisation ofemission generation of conventional vehicles in a highway scenario. We have demonstratedthat by adapting the methodology developed in Chapter 6, the SAS can be implemented in asimilar fashion, while taking account of vehicle density and composition. The performanceof the system was further validated through a variety of simulation studies including SUMOand HIL tests involving real vehicles.8.2 Future Work 1548.2 Future WorkThis section outlines some potential directions for future research.8.2.1 Grid Integration with EVsThe comparative framework presented in Chapter 3 was designed to evaluate the performanceof different EV charging strategies applied in distribution networks focusing on the powerflow and voltage issues arising from the interaction between the grid and EVs. This workcan be extended in a number of directions. It would of interest to include the impact of EVcharging on transient grid stability as reflected by frequency variations on the grid and toinvestigate how decentralised/distributed algorithms (e.g. AIMD and DPF) can be modifiedto improve grid stability. It would also be interesting to evaluate the practical performanceof each introduced method from the perspectives of communication overhead, delays andprotocols, by developing an effective communication channel model using realistic networksimulators (e.g. NS3 [78] and OMNeT++ [205]). Developing a more complex networkscenario, e.g., city scale distribution networks, to validate the performance of the chargingstrategies on a large scale would also be desirable.In the context of V2G applications, the proposed consensus algorithms were appliedto minimise current imbalance and optimise the power dispatch of EVs in Chapter 4. Forthe first V2G application, it would be of interest to investigate how to apply the consensusideas on EVs to address voltage imbalance issues and frequency regulation problems infuture research. However, as we mentioned previously in Chapter 4, addressing voltageimbalance issues using EVs will be more challenging since the voltages along phases dependon the distribution of the individual loads, which we did not need to consider in the studyof the current imbalance problem. For frequency regulation services, some recent work[70, 71, 201] has demonstrated the potential of V2G in this regard. As an extension for thesecond V2G application, it would be desirable to explore suitable business models to supportthe practical (commercial) implementation of the proposed V2G programme.8.2.2 Optimal Energy Management StrategiesIn Chapter 5 our proposed approach was tested on a simple microgrid scenario with a fewDERs and a total load of the order of a few MW. In future work the scenario could befurther extended by considering the presence of large scale storage systems in addition tothe distributed dynamic storage provided by EVs. This would provide more flexibility forpower regulation in the microgrid, however it also poses challenges for optimal algorithm8.2 Future Work 155design. Reference [190] shows in a different context, how AIMD algorithms can be modifiedto further include reactive power management. It would be interesting to explore this ideain the context of the microgrid scenario and coordination framework presented here, and inparticular, how multiple, potentially competing optimisation objectives can be incorporated.8.2.3 Distributed and Privacy-Aware Speed Advisory SystemsIn Chapters 6 and 7 we proposed an effective SAS for optimising both electric and conven-tional vehicles networks. There are a variety of ways this work can be extended, for example:recommended speeds can be communicated, for instance, by establishing a speed limit in thearea of interest. However, the speed indicated in the speed limit, and the true steady-state ofvehicles are clearly different. Realistic transportation simulations will allow us to identify themost convenient speed limit that in turn would result in an average speed close to the optimalone. Clearly, such an analysis is affected by the specific characteristics of the city centre ofinterest.In the simulation studies presented in the thesis the true communication network underly-ing the fleet of vehicles has not been modelled. We simply assumed that communicationscan occur in a random fashion. In future work, we shall further include realistic commu-nication networks in the mobility network simulator (e.g., VanetMobiSim [72]) to validatethe effectiveness of the SAS algorithm for specific applications of interest (e.g., in terms ofconvergence speed).References[1] Acha, S., Green, T.

The main\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0distinction is designed around the question of\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0who is allowed to (I) validate transactions, (II)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0write transactions to the ledger, and (III) read\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0transactions. Depending on the type of ledger,\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0the answer will vary. To keep things simple, we\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0can say that in public networks anyone can\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0validate, write, and read transactions. Whereas\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0in private networks, only invited members can\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0validate, write, and read transactions. Hybrid\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0variations are also possible.

The project will provide loans to farmers at lower interest rates using\u00a0the Dala token. Important to note that the project has a vertical approach. That is to\u00a0say, it seeks to facilitate the supply of agricultural products like fertilisers to the\u00a0farmers. It is possible that the farmers could enjoy a lower interest rate and greater\u00a0access to commodities that were previously difficult to attain.
