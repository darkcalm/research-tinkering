In addition\nto that functionality, the paper considers the role of intelligent\nsystems, in particular multi-agent systems, in providing flexible\nand extensible architectures for deploying intelligence within the\nSmart Grid. Beyond exploiting intelligent systems as architectural\nelements of the Smart Grid, with the purpose of meeting a set\nof engineering requirements, the role of intelligent systems as a\ntool for understanding what those requirements are in the first\ninstance, is also briefly discussed.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe continued increase in energy use in tandem with envi-\nronmental concerns is driving interest in \u201csmart\u201d or \u201cintelli-\ngent\u201d capabilities of energy networks. Both EPRI\u2019s IntelliGrid\ninitiative [1] and the European SmartGrids Technology Plat-\nform [2] envisage \u201csmart\u201d functionality as the key to meeting\nour future energy needs.\nThe scope of that \u201csmart\u201d functionality is wide. The char-\nacteristics of the \u201cSmart Grid\u201d set out in [3] and thus areas\nof application range from smart metering, demand-side man-\nagement, integration of distributed generation, energy storage\nand renewable resources, to back office systems which exploit\ndata from an upgraded, potentially more observable, energy\nnetwork.\nA key question is how \u201csmart\u201d functionality will be\nachieved. It is likely that an integrated suite of complementary\ntools, techniques, and standards, co-operating to meet the\ntechnological requirements of future networks, will have to\nbe developed.\nThe selection of technologies appropriate for this purpose\nmust center on proven solutions that can handle the complex-\nities of real network situations. While novel techniques and\napproaches may be required to implement the functionality\nrequired, the practical issues of noisy data, computational\ncomplexity, robustness, and upgradability must be strongly\nconsidered before deployment becomes a reality.\nThe capabilities required by the proposed future networks\ncan be divided into two separate but related parts. The first\nis the decision-making functionality that evaluates network\nstate and proposes actions to meet certain objectives. This\nincludes high level strategic objectives such as maximizing\nDG access, through to lower level technical objectives such as\nnot exceeding thermal constraints. Each utility, and each topo-\ngraphical region will have differing priorities and objectives,\nmeaning that the particular requirements on decision-making\nfunctionality will change with the situation.\nThe second part of the intelligent grid vision is the platform\nfor delivering this distributed and varying decision-making\nfunctionality. Based on requirements such as plug-and-play\ncapability, local autonomy, and self-managing and self-healing\noperation, this platform is itself a challenging system to design\nand build.\nThis paper considers the role that intelligent systems tech-\nniques may play in meeting the challenges posed by these re-\nquirements. Section II discusses the need for decision-making\nfunctionality, and how this may be addressed. Section III con-\nsiders the requirements on a smart grid delivery platform, both\nfrom the perspectives of distributed and robust deployment,\nand self-monitoring and self-managing capabilities. Section IV\nexamines the role of intelligent system approaches with respect\nto more conventional or traditional analytical approaches.\nFinally, Section V discusses the potential role of intelligent\nsystems in the life cycle management of \u201cSmart Grids\u201d, i.e.\ntools to help planners and policy-makers decide what the\nengineering requirements of the \u201cSmart Grid\u201d are.\nII. INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS FOR PROVIDING CONTROL\nDECISION-MAKING FUNCTIONALITY\nIntelligent systems techniques may have a role to play in\nproviding a \u201cSmart Grid\u201d with \u201cintelligent\u201d network manage-\nment and control functionality. By \u201cintelligent\u201d here, we mean\ncontrol and management functionality with the properties asso-\nciated with intelligent systems: flexibility; graceful degradation\nin the face of measurement and communication errors and\nplant failure; and, potentially, the ability to learn and improve\nperformance over time. While not all intelligent systems\ndisplay all of these properties, different techniques can display\nthem to varying degrees. By way of a set of examples, we\nwill use a project called AuRA-NMS (Autonomous Regional\nActive Network Management System).\nAuRA-NMS was a three and a half year research and devel-\nopment programme that involved seven UK universities, two\ndistribution network operators and a major manufacturer and it\nhad the aim of developing and demonstrating a \u201csmart\u201d active\nnetwork management system. AuRA-NMS was driven by the\nDNOs\u2019 need to increase DG access to networks while avoiding\nor deferring the cost of network reinforcement. In addition to\ncost implications, ANM can also help connect generation more\nquickly given the time-scales often associated with gaining\nplanning consent for some network reinforcements.\nThrough AuRA-NMS, DNOs were looking for a way of\nmoving from bespoke single issue active network management\nsolutions to a more generic solution that can be rapidly\ndeployed for a variety of MV networks and deal with multiple\nissues in a coordinated manner, e.g. power flow management,\nsteady state voltage control, restoration, and minimization of\nlosses. During the course of the programme a number of\napproaches to each of those control tasks were investigated\nand the most promising prototyped. In some cases, those\napproaches exploited intelligent systems techniques.\nThe selection of intelligent system techniques was based\non the DNOs\u2019 requirements for flexible and extensible solu-\ntions which were also fault tolerant and whose performance\ndegraded gracefully in the presence of measurement errors,\nmodel error (error in the model the techniques use to generate\nsolutions) and communication problems. The interested reader\nwill find more details of these requirements in [4] [5].\nAt the time of writing AuRA-NMS was moving to a trial\ndeployment stage of its development. Readers interested in the\nnature of that deployment can find details in [6]. In this paper\nwe focus on the intelligent systems techniques used and the\nrationale for their selection.\nA. AI techniques for power flow management\nIn the context of AuRA-NMS, power flow management\ninvolves the management of distributed generators in a manner\nthat thermal limits of plant are not exceeded. Thermal limits\nplace a limitation on the firm DG connections that a network\ncan support without having to reinforce the network. Alterna-\ntively, DG network access can be limited during the network\nconditions where thermal limits would be exceeded. If the\npossibility of curtailment of generation is rare over the course\nof the year, then it can be more economic for generators to\nconnect to the network under an agreement that their output\ncan be curtailed when network conditions dictate. During\nthe research phase of AuRA-NMS, a number of different\napproaches to power flow management were investigated:\n\u2022 A current-tracing approach [7];\n\u2022 An OPF-based approach [8]; and\n\u2022 an approach based on the AI technique of constraint\nprogramming (CP) [9].\nFor the moment, we will focus on the AI technique.\nThe constraint programming approach involved modeling the\npower flow management problem as a constraint satisfaction\nproblem (CSP). Each controllable item of plant is considered\na variable in the problem [9]. That variable can have a\nnumber of discrete values, i.e. control responses. Solving\nthe CSP becomes one of searching for assignments of those\ndiscrete values such that a set of constraints is not violated.\nThese constraints are: that the network access rights must be\nrespected (contractual constraints) and that power flows remain\nwithin limits (the power flow constraint). Search is guided\nusing a preference constraint, which can be thought of as the\nconstraint programming equivalent to an objective function.\nThe preference constraint is used to search for solutions that\nmeet the contractual and power flow constraints but maximize\nDG access in a best first manner. To this end, an off-the-\nshelf CSP solver and an off-the-shelf load flow engine were\nintegrated on ABB\u2019s COM6xx series substation computer.\nFull details of the constraint programming approach can\nbe found in [9], including case studies on two very different\nnetworks.\nThe rationale for investigating constraint programming was\nthat a network agnostic solution that would degrade gracefully\nwas required. As the constraint programming approach was\nmodel-based (but not in AI terms), it could be applied to\ndifferent networks simply by changing the model. If network\naccess agreements changed, these too could be potentially\nupdated. However, the fact that the approach could produce\na set of ranked solutions offered the possibility of graceful\ndegradation in performance. Should an attempted solution not\nremove a thermal overload, then the next ranked solution could\nbe applied. Given that model error is inevitable, this was seen\nas a strength of the technique.\nLike OPF, the approach is fairly computationally intensive,\nso tests were run on the substation computing platform used by\nABB to assess how long it would take to compute a solution\nunder different network conditions. Tests showed that solutions\nunder normal conditions could be calculated in 1\u20132 seconds\nfor the case study networks. Under worst case scenarios,\nrequiring complete traversal of the entire search space, this was\nstill achieved in under 10 seconds for the more complicated\nnetwork. Hence, on currently available hardware, computing\nsolutions in adequate time-scales was deemed feasible for the\ntest networks.\nTo date the prototype software implementation for the CP\napproach has been tested using a real-time testing environment\ndeveloped by the authors. The real-time simulator runs on\na dedicated PC and uses a quasi-stationary model of the\nnetwork under test, running an AC load flow engine once a\nsecond to evaluate flows around the network. The simulator\nalso includes a number of controller models that simulate the\ncontrol response of tap-changers, breakers, trip/trim control\nof generators, power factor set-point control and real power\nset-point control, which introduce inter-tap delays in the case\nof transformers and generator ramp and trim rates. Results of\n\u2018closed-loop\u2019 testing using this simulator can be found in [9].\nAn example network that was used for testing is shown in\nFigure 1, while Figure 2 shows the software integrated with\nthe COM6xx unit, and Figure 3 shows the simulated real time\ngenerator response.\nG G\nG\nG\nG\nG\n45 MVA 45 MVA\nGen, 3, 4, 5\nWind Farm\n62 MVA\nHydro\nGen 7\nWind Farm Gen 6\nWind Farm\nGen 1\nWind Farm\nGen 2\nWind Farm\n132kV 132kV\nSUB A SUB B\nSUB C\nSUB D\nSUB E\nSUB G\nSUB F\n33kV 33kV\nSUB X\nCOM\n600\nArea of Control\nGG\nLine 1\nLine 2\nLine 3\nFig. 1.

Power flow management software running on a COM6xx unit,\ninterfacing to external IEDs for acquiring measurements and issuing control\ncommands.\nIn addition to the AI technique of constraint programming,\nwe also investigated the online use of a conventional power\nsystems analysis tool, OPF, for power flow management,\ndeveloping prototype software to run on the COM6xx. That\nwork is discussed in Section IV.\nB. AI techniques for voltage control\nOne of the effects of increasing levels of DG on distribution\nnetworks is the problem of voltage regulation, normally volt-\nage rise issues. A range of approaches have been investigated\nfor voltage control [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17].\nDuring the development of AuRA-NMS two AI techniques\nwhere considered for coordinated control of steady-state volt-\nFig. 3. Control signal from COM6xx and generator response that signal.\nData was captured from a real-time test using OPC data logging tools\nage: a constraint programming approach and a case-based\nreasoning approach. The rationale for exploring the use of\nconstraint programming was similar to that of its use for power\nflow management. Since the general approach is similar to the\npower flow management problem, we will not discuss it here.\nCBR however, offers a interesting alternative.\nThe rationale behind the use of the CBR approach to voltage\ncontrol was developed by Phil Taylor at Durham University.\nRather than calculate a solution online using a analytical\napproach, such as OPF or CP, Taylor suggested that a pre-\nenumerated set of solutions to voltage excursion problems\ncould be created offline. When the system was online, finding a\nsolution to a particular voltage excursion would involve finding\nappropriate solutions from the pre-enumerated set. As long as\nthat set was not excessively large, the approach would be fast\nand avoid problems associated with the non-convergence of\nload flows or OPFs.\nLike the constraint programming approach, the CBR ap-\nproach to voltage control can offer several solutions to the\nsame problem. Should a solution fail, other solutions can be\napplied, leading to a degree of graceful degradation.\nDetails of the CBR approach and initial results of testing\ncan be found in [18].\nC. AI approaches to restoration\nThe approach to restoration developed during the AuRA-\nNMS programme by the University of Cardiff did not employ\nintelligent systems techniques, however, a large body of work\nfor the use of AI approaches to restoration exists [19], [20],\n[21], [22], [23], [24], [25].\nIII. INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS FOR SMART GRID\nARCHITECTURE\nTo fully realize the vision of a distributed, intelligent\ngrid, the architecture itself is as important as the decision-\nmaking functionality. The system must have certain properties,\nnamely:\n\u2022 Flexibility, to accommodate different utilities\u2019 needs,\n\u2022 Extensibility, to keep pace with changing requirements,\n\u2022 Open access, allowing functionality from different\nproviders to interoperate,\n\u2022 Fault tolerance, to handle noisy data and degrade grace-\nfully in the presence of partial failure.\nLess essential, but certainly desirable, are extended capa-\nbilities such as utilizing all available data within a utility to\ninfluence operation, and allowing utilities themselves to select\nthe level of automation for a given situation or scenario. These\nsets of requirements will be considered in turn below.\nA. Distributed and Robust Deployment\nMulti-agent systems (MAS) technology has previously been\nsuggested for providing the systems integration capabilities\nrequired for a variety of power engineering applications [26].\nSuch applications, including diagnostics, condition monitor-\ning, and distributed control, display many of the same require-\nments individually as the unified smart grid vision presents.\nA multi-agent system comprises a set of intelligent agents\nco-operating to achieve their goals or tasks, assigned by the\nagent designer. An intelligent agent is said to display flexible\nautonomy [27], through a mixture of reactivity, pro-activeness,\nand social ability. Each agent can display a different mix of\nthese qualities as appropriate for meeting its current goals.\nThese properties of individual agents lead to a multi-agent\nsystem with particular properties. The system can be flexible,\nin that each agent can react to changes in network conditions\nand utility objectives to meet new constraints or operational\nneeds. The system can be extended by deploying new agents\nas functionality is developed, allowing staged deployment\nof different management capabilities. Mechanisms of MAS\ncan be employed to create a fault tolerant system, such as\ndeploying duplicate agents with the same capabilities to take\nover responsibilities in the case of partial system failure, and\ndistributing agents across different physical locations through\nplatform federation [4].\nThe criterion for open access can be met by employing stan-\ndards for communication between agents within the system.\nSince agents interact by messaging, standards-conformance in\nthe structure and protocols of messaging allows agents with\ndifferent designers to meaningfully communicate about data,\nthe state of the network, or any proposed control actions. The\nstandards created by the Foundation for Intelligent Physical\nAgents (FIPA) have become the de facto standard for many\nMAS for power engineering applications [28]. However, these\nstandards only cover the protocols, message structure, and\ncontent grammar, leaving out the content lexicon, or ontology,\nwhich is the application-specific set of terms used for com-\nmunicating about a given domain. Since the field of power\nengineering applications is relatively restricted, and the points\nof meaningful communication occur at a high level, it has\nbeen suggested that an upper ontology for power engineering\napplications could be derived [28]. This would allow agents to\ndiscuss high-level concepts such as network topology, control\nactions, and items of plant. This upper ontology could be\nbased on existing data standards, specifically the Common\nInformation Model (CIM) and IEC 61850.\nIndeed, MAS technology has already been deployed at\na utility[29], for the application of post-fault analysis. This\nshows that the essential requirements for smart grid functional-\nity of flexibility, extensibility, open access, and fault tolerance\ncan be met by MAS.\nB. System Self-Management through Condition Monitoring\nand Selectively Devolved Control\nWide area monitoring of the network will be required to\nsupport the growing decision-making functionality described\nabove. However, this increased system observability coupled\nwith new communications links offers intelligent system appli-\ncations further to the automation capabilities previously out-\nlined. These may be loosely termed self-management capabili-\nties, where the intelligent network system can monitor its own\noperation and adapt as appropriate. Two particular examples\nof this functionality will be considered here, specifically the\nuse of asset health information as an input to control decision-\nmaking, and the ability to selectively devolve automation from\nthe control room to local intelligent controllers.\n1) On-line Asset Health Monitoring: Two 275/132kV\n180MVA transformers at a substation in the UK are nearing\nthe end of their design life. The owner utility wants to keep\nthis plant in service for as long as possible without too great a\nrisk of failure in service. To achieve this, the transformers are\nunder intensive monitoring with a wide set of on-line sensors,\nallowing engineers constant access to the latest measurements.\nThe utility desires the detection of anomalous transformer\nbehavior on-line, potentially giving early warning of failure.\nFor this application, the intelligent system technique of\nGaussian Mixture Modeling was selected to model the normal\nbehavior of transformer parameters. Two months of data were\nselected as representative of normal operation, and used to\nlearn a Gaussian Mixture Model of the relationships between\ntransformer oil parameters and environmental parameters in-\ncluding ambient temperature and load current [30].\nAnomaly detection is achieved by comparing new on-line\nmeasurements with this model. Any changes to the relationship\nbetween environmental conditions and transformer behavior\nare highlighted by the model returning a low probability of\nthese measurements occurring.\nThe anomaly detection capabilities are wrapped as agents,\nand operate within a wider condition monitoring multi-agent\nsystem that includes dissolved gas analysis and partial dis-\ncharge diagnosis [30]. This system exploits the deployment\nbenefits of agent technology described above, allowing the\nappropriate mix of diagnostic and anomaly detection func-\ntionality to be flexibly deployed for a given substation, and\nusing standards-conforming social ability to allow system\nextensibility.\nThis system has been collecting data on-line since August\n2008. To date, 22 anomalies have been detected, all of which\nhave been caused by transient sensor faults.\nWithin the context of intelligent network operation, on-\nline asset health monitoring such as this has a role to play\nin providing information for decision-making functionality.\nThe occurrence of anomalous behavior and diagnosable faults\ncould, for example, alter the dynamic rating of assets such as\ntransformers, or reduce the number of permissible operations\nfor tap changers or circuit breakers.\nThis condition information already exists within utilities, but\nthe logistical challenges of making it available in the control\nroom and the knowledge required to act upon it appropriately\nmean that asset health is rarely a consideration for control\nengineers. However, if health assessment and operational de-\ncisions are both devolved to local areas of the network as\nmulti-agent systems, with associated benefits of open access\nand extensibility, the results of one can be used to influence\nthe other.\nC. Selectively Devolved Control\nOne of the concepts developed during AuRA-NMS was the\nnotion of selectively devolved goal driven network control.\nThe concept was developed through discussions with DNO\ncontrol engineers. The engineers wished to be able to assign\nAuRA-NMS an area of network and set the control goals for\nthat area. Those goals could be: the regulation voltage within\ncertain limits; operation of the power system within thermal\nlimits; automatic restoration; and the reduction of losses.\nEngineers would set system goals, and the ANM system would\nbe left to to make decisions on how to meet the goals.\nFrom the control engineer\u2019s perspective, selectively de-\nvolved goal driven control means that goals can be assigned\nto the ANM system in a way which best suits the control\nengineer at that time, providing more flexibility than having a\ncontrol scheme that can be simply enabled or disabled. MAS\ncould be used to implement such an approach.\nIV. COMPARISON WITH CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES\nIf intelligent systems are to enter the \u201cSmart Grid\u201d toolbox\nthen, in addition to demonstration, their performance with\nrespect to other methods needs to be understood. Studies\nwhich compare the performance of intelligent systems tech-\nniques with more conventional approaches are rare. As part\nof the science undertaken as part of AuRA-NMS, competing\ntechniques were subject to comparative testing. By way of\nan example we can highlight the testing of the constraint\nprogramming and OPF approaches to power flow management.\nThe power flow management problem can be formulated\nas an OPF [8]. This leads to two questions: can solutions be\ncalculated in a feasible timescale; and is the approach robust\nenough?\nDuring the AuRA-NMS programme, a commercially avail-\nable OPF engine was integrated with ABB\u2019s COM6xx unit,\nacquiring measurements from the simulated network via simu-\nlated IEDs in a similar manner to the constraint programming\napproach in Section II-A. In terms of timescales, when the\nOPF did converge, it did so in around a second on both\nnetworks. Initial results can be found in [8]. It is the authors\u2019\nhope to fully publish results from that testing in the near\nfuture; however, those initial results indicate that while the\nOPF we used could, given no errors in measurements, the\nmodel, the communications link, or estimation of the network\nstate, result in greater energy yield over the CP approach, the\nrobustness of the optimization under those errors or changes to\nnetwork state, repeatedly led to non-convergence of the OPF\nand thus failure of the approach. CP on the other hand, in\nthe initial testing, displayed greater robustness and graceful\ndegradation. From the DNOs\u2019 perspective, solutions have to be\nrobust. While optimal solutions are desired, robustness takes\nprecedence.\nHowever, this opens up the possibility of a hybrid approach\nthat uses the strengths of one technique to compensate for the\nweakness of the other. By combining the approaches, energy\nyields may be \u201coptimized\u201d using OPF while using CP to\nprovide alternative solutions and graceful degradation when\nOPF fails.\nV. POWER SYSTEMS ANALYSIS FOR THE SMART GRID\nThe investigation of intelligent systems techniques for\npower systems analysis has a long history. While a review\nof that history is out of the scope of this panel paper, AI ap-\nproaches to optimization for different power systems planning\nand operation support problems frequently appear in IEEE\nTransactions on Power Systems. The move to increasingly\nactive distribution networks with stochastic generation, energy\nstorage, and controllable and observable load is going to\nchange the way these networks are planned and operated. So,\nwhile there is a requirement for tools and techniques to provide\nfuture energy networks with \u201csmart\u201d control functionality,\nand architectures which provide the appropriate flexibility and\nextensibility, tools and techniques to aid the planners of future\nenergy networks will also be required. Intelligent systems\ntechniques may have a role to play in that arena in areas where\nconventional techniques fall short.\nLife cycle management for \u201cSmart Grids\u201d, when that pro-\ncess is defined, will require support tools. It remains to be\nseen if conventional analysis tools will suffice.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nThe \u201cSmart Grid\u201d vision for future networks represents\na potential sea-change in the way networks are planned,\nmaintained and operated. In this paper we have discussed\nthe role intelligent systems techniques from the perspective\nof our experience in that area. Practical examples in the form\nof an active network management system and related condition\nmonitoring and post-fault analysis systems have been used to\nillustrate those potential roles where a degree of deployment\nand demonstration has already taken place.\nREFERENCES\n[1] IntelliGrid, \u201cSmart power for the 21st century,\u201d\nhttp://intelligrid.epri.com/.\n[2] SmartGrids, \u201cVision and strategy for european electricity networks of\nthe future,\u201d 2007, http://www.smartgrids.eu/.\n[3] NIST, \u201cNist framework and roadmap for smart grid interoperability\nstandards release 1.0 (draft),\u201d 2010, http://www.nist.gov/.\n[4] S.

M. Catterson, E. M. Davidson, S. D. J. McArthur\nAbstract\nThe transformation of energy networks from passive to active systems requires the embedding\nof intelligence within the network. One suitable approach to integrating distributed intelligent\nsystems is multi-agent systems technology, where components of functionality run as autonomous\nagents capable of interaction through messaging. This provides loose coupling between compo-\nnents that can benefit the complex systems envisioned for the smart grid. This paper reviews\nthe key milestones of demonstrated agent systems in the power industry, and considers which\naspects of agent design must still be addressed for widespread application of agent technology to\noccur.\n1 Introduction\nEnergy networks are currently undergoing transformation, from the passive system with reactive\nprotection and control of the last 100 years, to the active and proactive systems required to\ndeliver smarter grid capabilities. This change requires a raft of technologies and data analysis\n1\ntechniques, to fill what the European SmartGrids Technology Platform document calls \u201ca toolbox\nof smart grid capabilities\u201d [1].\nThe smart grid vision is of multiple, complex systems interacting safely and correctly, delivering\nnew network functionality such as active network management and integrated condition moni-\ntoring, with the aim of more efficient use of power system resources and greater participation\nof end users. The end result will be a power network that flexibly allows the connection of\nmore embedded and renewable generation, while handling changing load profiles due to electric\nvehicles and demand side management.\nDelivery of smarter grid services will require a technology for integrating all of this functionality,\nin a way that does not negatively impact key metrics such as customer minutes lost in the\nUK, and system average interruption duration index (SAIDI) in the US. One such technology\nbeing proposed is multi-agent systems, where large, complex systems can be built from smaller,\nautonomous agents of functionality [2]. In essence, agents offer a platform for designing and\ndelivering the complex smart grid application, from a set of constituent parts that are currently\nbeing researched and tested.\nThis paper examines the role that agent technology could play within the power engineering\ndomain, by reviewing the key contributions within the field of agents in power, and highlight-\ning where more research is required. Section 2 presents the key concepts and definitions, with\nconsideration of some related areas of research. Section 3 reviews the state-of-the-art of agent\napplications by discussing some milestone industrial demonstrators and deployments of agent\ntechnology. The agent application areas discussed include post-fault analysis, condition moni-\ntoring, congestion management, and automatic restoration. From this, Section 5 draws out some\nchallenges which remain for agent development in the power industry. Section 6 concludes the\npaper.\n2\n2 Concepts\nMany concepts within the area of agent development mean different things to different people.\nThis leads to obfuscation of the potential benefits that agents may offer, and thus can impede\nunderstanding.\nThe IEEE Power and Energy Society (PES) Multi-Agent Systems Working Group aims to offer\nleadership in this area by defining the terminology most used within the field. Through the\npublication of two papers\u2014one specifically on concepts and approaches to developing agent\nsystems [3], the other on technologies and tools for implementing agents [4]\u2014the working group\nhas provided some clarity on definitions that all in the field may examine, and decide whether\nor not the stated benefits of agents are achievable.\nThis section presents the key terms with discussion of the working group-agreed definitions, and\nprovides discussion of the similarities and differences between agents and other intelligent system\ntechniques and computing platforms.\n2.1 Agent\nThe first task is to define an agent. The power engineering community has largely settled on\nthe definition proposed by Wooldridge [5], that an agent is \u201ca software (or hardware) entity\nthat is situated in some environment and is able to autonomously react to changes in that\nenvironment\u201d. The environment here is the world surrounding the agent, able to be observed\nby the agent through sensors, and influenced by the agent through it taking some action in the\nworld, but with a separation between the two.\nThat the agent is autonomous means that it is able to \u201cexercise control over its actions\u201d [6].\nThis is a somewhat vague definition, but essentially implies that no other program or entity\n3\nexerts direct control over the agent; unlike a programming subroutine, which must be called\nby a higher-level thread of execution in order to run, the agent itself schedules its behaviours\nto run or otherwise. It should be noted that the agent can perform an operation on behalf of\nanother entity, and indeed, it is common for an agent to react to an incoming message by taking\nsome action. But the important distinction is that the sending agent is not calling the receiver\u2019s\nfunctions, and the thread of execution does not pass from the message sender to the message\nreceiver; rather, two separate threads of execution exist and it is possible for the receiving agent\nto refuse to service the sender\u2019s request. A legitimate example of this situation would be where\nthe receiving agent does not have enough memory to complete an action, in which case it replies\nwith a message refusing the request.\nThe definition of an agent acting autonomously within an environment is only one of many\nposited definitions. The computer science community has proposed a number over the years,\nincluding [7\u201310]. However, many of the alternative definitions are relatively vague and intention-\nally inclusive, allowing existing systems to be redefined as agents. This offers no tangible benefit\nto the engineering community, which is more concerned with the differentiating factors between\nagent systems and non-agent systems, in order to assess the potential benefits of this technology.\nAs a result, Wooldridge\u2019s definition is the one of choice.\n2.2 Intelligent Agent\nBuilding on the definition of an agent, Wooldrige also defines the notion of an intelligent agent.\nWhere an agent displays autonomy in an environment, an intelligent agent displays flexible\nautonomy as identified by three properties:\n\u2022 Reactivity: the ability to respond to an event in a timely manner\n\u2022 Pro-activeness: the ability to \u201ctake the initiative\u201d, as demonstrated through goal-directed\nbehaviour\n4\n\u2022 Social ability: the ability to interact with other agents in the environment.\nAny intelligent agent will display these three properties in some combination, and different\nintelligent agents will display varying levels of each. However, it is the goal-directed behaviour\nof an intelligent agent which truly sets it apart from other systems, making it more than just\ncapable of responding to particular situations in a reactive manner.\n2.3 Multi-Agent System\nA collection of agents and intelligent agents interacting within the same environment comprises\na multi-agent system. Since the system is made up of individual autonomous agents, each with\ntheir individual goals and reactive capabilities, there is no overall system goal or global goal.\nInstead, it is left to the system designer to ensure that the correct mix of agents is present within\nthe system in order to achieve their desired outcomes.\nFor example, if two tasks are required to achieve the system designer\u2019s goal, the designer must\nensure that agents within the system have the local goals appropriate to performing both tasks,\neither by giving both goals to one agent, or one goal each to two different agents.\nThis suggests the ability of agents to co-operate to meet their goals. Co-operation and co-\nordination can be achieved due to the social ability of intelligent agents, which allows communi-\ncation about tasks and goals through adherence to standards for inter-agent messaging.\n2.4 Agent Standards\nWithin the power engineering community, the use of standards is becoming increasingly impor-\ntant. Utilities desire systems that conform to industry standards for data exchange, including\n5\nthe Common Information Model (CIM) [11] and IEC 61850 [12]. As a result, any agent sys-\ntems developed for this arena must adhere to appropriate standards, to give open, plug-and-play\nsystems. Since agents interact via messaging, standards-adherence largely means conforming to\nopen standards for inter-agent communication.\nAs with other communication systems, messaging occurs in different standardised layers. These\nare message transport (the delivery of a message), message format (the agent communication\nlanguage), and message content (both grammar and vocabulary).\nThe Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA) have created a suite of standards that\ncover the full stack of agent communication. FIPA was accepted as a standards committee of the\nIEEE Computer Society in 2005, and the FIPA standards have become the de facto standards\nfor agent development within the power domain.\n2.4.1 The Agent Platform\nMessage transport and delivery to agents is specified through FIPA\u2019s Agent Management Refer-\nence model, which defines \u201cthe normative framework within which FIPA agents exist and operate.\nIt establishes the logical reference model for the creation, registration, location, communication,\nmigration and retirement of agents.\u201d [13]. This means FIPA agents reside on a platform which\nhandles messaging using a transport protocol such as HTTP or IIOP, and handles addressing of\nagents by keeping track of those present on the platform.\nThis functionality is supplemented by a specified Directory Facilitator (DF) agent. Agents joining\nthe platform can register their services with the DF, which provides a searchable directory of\nservices and agents within the system. This allows a decoupling of tasks within the multi-agent\nsystem: agents need not be hard coded with the contact details of others whose services they\nneed; instead, agents can search the DF for the currently-available providers of those services.\n6\nThe searchable DF and seamless message transport and delivery offered by a FIPA-compliant\nagent platform are the foundations of an open, extensible multi-agent system.\n2.4.2 Message Format\nThe agent platform provides the path for message transport between agents, but the format\nof the messages themselves must also be standardised for meaningful communication to occur.\nSome of the earliest agent systems defined proprietary communication languages (e.g. [14]), which\nwere followed by interaction through blackboard architectures (e.g. [15]), before development of\nstandardised communication languages such as Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language\n(KQML) [16].\nBuilding on KQML, the FIPA Agent Communication Language (FIPA-ACL) standardises the\nstructure and flow of messages between agents on a FIPA agent platform [17]. Message fields\ninclude receiving and sending agent addresses, message sequence information, and the message\ncontent. All these fields are optional; the only mandatory field is the message performative which\nindicates the intention behind the message, such as whether it is a request for an action, a query\nfor information, or informing another agent of some information.\nFIPA-ACL messages are often sent as part of a sequence of interaction, such as an inform message\nbeing sent in response to a query. Some common interaction patterns are also specified by FIPA.\n2.4.3 Message Content\nWhile FIPA-ACL provides the headers for a message, the content structure is out of scope for that\nstandard. The syntax and semantics, or grammar and lexicon of message content are provided\nby a content language and ontology, respectively.\n7\nThe FIPA Semantic Language (FIPA-SL) has reached a stable standard version [18], providing a\nfirst order logic-style grammar for messages. Ontology is application-specific, making it impos-\nsible for a general standards-body such as FIPA to define a standard ontology. Therefore, agent\nsystem designers must design and build an ontology that suits the particular application their\nagents operate on.\nThe IEEE PES Multi-Agent Systems Working Group has defined an ontology for power en-\ngineering applications, largely based on CIM, which can be used as a basis for defining an\napplication-specific ontology [19]. It is anticipated that agents from different designers will\nlargely communicate about power systems concepts such as substations, voltages, and circuit\nbreakers, and so this ontology of common terms will ease the creation of open agent systems.\n2.5 Agents and Related Technologies\nIt is worth discussing the distinction between a theoretical engineering agent, which conforms\nto the given definitions and displays goal-directed behaviour and social ability, and a practical\nengineering agent, which is designed and built using the tools and approaches available today.\nWhile the above definitions indicate what an intelligent agent looks like, the reality is that such\na theoretical agent is not fully realisable using current resources. For practical applications the\nintelligent agent will be implemented in such a way that it may not have the social ability that\nwe may desire, or its behaviour will not be as goal-directed as the ideal.\nThis is because the concept of an intelligent agent builds on other parts of computer science\nwhich are not currently at the stage of delivering the task-decomposition and question-answering\ntechnologies that a theoretical agent requires. This section considers these related technologies\nin the context of agent systems, identifying the place within agent research for each of these\nfields.\n8\n2.5.1 Agents and Intelligent Systems\nThe heart of an intelligent agent is its ability to reason about its goals and the state of the world,\nand take actions to try to achieve its goals. The choice of reasoning technique employed is an\nopen question, with many different solutions being proposed. These range from general purpose\nreasoning such as that offered by AI planners [20] or the belief-desire-intention framework [21],\nto application-specific solutions such as neural networks or other pattern recognition techniques\ntrained to perform a specific operation [22].\nIn theory, an intelligent agent should display goal-directed behaviour. This strongly suggests\nthat an \u2018ideal\u2019 agent should embody a planner, allowing it to assemble sequences of actions to\nachieve its goal. However, including a planner has disadvantages. One is purely practical: many\nagents will only have one or two potential actions at their disposal, designed to achieve one\nspecific task. AI planning is pointless for organising such a simple set of actions, and would\nnot improve the ability of the agent. Implementing planners within each agent would require\nsignificant developmental effort, for no gain in the general case.\nHowever, even in the specific cases where an agent does have the potential to meet its goals in\nmultiple ways, including a planner is not always helpful. Consider a situation where an agent A\nrequires an agent B to perform a service in order to meet its goal. If agent B fails to complete\nthe service, agent A must find an alternative solution. It may be the case that two other agents,\nC and D, can each perform subtasks that together meet the same objective as agent B\u2019s service.\nFor agent A to be able to reason about this situation and replan to request services of agents C\nand D, it must be able to perform task decomposition, breaking down the one service provided\nby B into the two subtasks offered by C and D.\nTask decomposition has been under extensive research in the field of semantic web services\n[23\u201325]. To be able to perform task decomposition on the service offered by agent B, the designer\nof agent A would need to describe the service to such a fine level of detail that it would be\n9\nequivalent to implementing the service itself.\nConsider the service of performing a Discrete Fourier Transform (Yk =\n\u2211N\u22121\nn=0 Xne\n\u2212 2piiN nk) on\na dataset. Given the definition of the DFT, this service could be decomposed into sub-services\nincluding sum, multiply, power, and so on. However, understanding the combination in which\nthese sub-services should be used requires as much information as implementing the DFT itself.\nAt this point, the only benefit to service decomposition is that it allows the spreading of compu-\ntational load, which changes the topic of discussion to distributed computing for optimisation,\nrather than software organisation and systems design.\nThis raises the question of whether the theory of an ideal agent is faulty. If we cannot reach the\nstate of goal-driven co-operating agents, then why use an agent approach for system design? In\npractice, the benefits of this approach are actually coincidental to the theory of agents. The value\noffered by multi-agent systems design is due to the decomposition of the system into reusable,\nredeployable, communicating components, each capable of performing its task autonomously.\nThis allows a system to be reconfigured for use in multiple scenarios, and eases the merging of\nmultiple systems by enforcing the use of common agent communications technologies. Addition-\nally, because each autonomous agent performs a single clearly-defined task, it can be thoroughly\ndesigned and tested before deployment in the system.\nThis is not to say that planning has no place in a multi-agent system. While a practical agent\ncannot achieve goal-directed behaviour through co-operation, it can do so autonomously provided\nthat it has sufficient reasoning capability to allow pro-active behaviour. Examples of this may\nrange from using neural networks for parameter prediction, or rule based reasoning for operator\ndecision support, through to AI planning for network reconfiguration.\n10\nAgent A Agent B\n((all ?x (and (IsA ?x Temperature)\n              (GreaterThan ?x 30))))\n\u2026\nsql = parseClause (\"(IsA ?x Temperature)\") +\n      parseClause (\"(GreaterThan ?x 30)\")\nresults = database.select (sql)\nmsg = buildResponse (results)\nmsg.send ()\n\u2026\nreturns \"SELECT * FROM temperature\", \nconverting Temperature symbol into \ntemperature table name\nreturns \"WHERE value > 30\",\nassuming Temperature GreaterThan 30 \nmeans temperature.value > 30\nFigure 1: When an agent receives a message, it must translate content terms into method calls\nand database queries according to its internal knowledge representation.\n2.5.2 Agents and Service-Oriented Architectures\nThe social ability of an intelligent agent theoretically allows for an agent to receive any standards-\nconforming query about information it knows and respond with an appropriate answer. In\npractice, agents are largely hard-coded to recognise and respond to set messages on topics they\nknow, making the practice very different from the theory [26].\nThe problem is one of knowledge-representation, and is related to the choice of reasoning tech-\nnique that gives an agent its intelligence. When a message is received, the agent must per-\nform some conversion from terms within the content field into actions to take, methods to call,\ndatabases to consult, etc., before performing a second conversion from action results, method re-\nturn values, and database results into ontology and content language terms for sending a response\n(see Fig. 1).\nOne way around the problem is to design the agent so that it uses the ontology for knowledge\nrepresentation, and all its knowledge and state is already stored in ontology terms. However,\nin almost all situations a practical agent is going to hold more detailed knowledge than can be\nrepresented using the ontology. Say an agent can respond to queries for temperature data, taken\n11\nfrom a particular sensor. The ontology will provide the ability to describe a temperature, giving\nit a value, a unit, and the time it was measured. The agent must also know how to address\nthe sensor and how to take readings, which is low-level detail that should not be covered by the\nontology. The knowledge representation capabilities of the agent will necessarily be broader than\nthe ontology alone, meaning that at some point of the agent\u2019s reasoning process there will be\ntranslation between ontology terms and specific methods or actions the agent can take.\nThis problem of restricted social ability has been recognised, and the most advanced solution is\ncurrently the JADE Semantics Add-On (JSA) [26]. Designed for the JADE agent platform, the\nJSA simplifies the task of linking ontology terms with particular agent actions, separating out\nthe hard-coded elements to one particular place and thus simplifying maintainability issues.\nHowever the general problem still stands, that the ontology lists a set of terms that an agent can\nemploy in messages, while the implementation of what those terms mean is dependent on each\nagent\u2019s designer making an explicit link between an ontology term and the agent\u2019s actions.\nService oriented architectures (SOA) must also address this problem when exposing interfaces\nfor web services. Web services are similar to agent services, in that heterogeneous systems\noperate together using a service model. The standards governing web services include the Web\nService Description Language (WSDL) [27] and Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration\n(UDDI) protocol [28].\nWSDL is an XML-format language used to give information about services. Contrary to its name,\nWSDL describes how to access and use the service rather than describing the service itself, with\nparameters such as the address, message template, and data types. It can be considered a\nlanguage for service syntax, without semantic information.\nUDDI is a service registry, similar to the FIPA DF. Service providers can register their WSDL\nservice description with a UDDI node, advertising how to access that service. UDDI is a passive\nmatchmaker, storing information generally referred to as white pages, yellow pages, and green\n12\npages information. White pages information involves general contact details for the service\nprovider; yellow pages information uses a taxonomy of business or industry categories to describe\na service; and green pages information includes interfaces and addresses for service access (in\nWSDL). Searching can be performed on individual parameters.\nThe semantics of a web service are therefore described in the yellow pages information, based\non categories defined in published taxonomies. This is exactly analogous to an agent system\u2019s\nontology: the meaning of terms must be inferred by the system designer, and explicit links made\nbetween service terms and software actions. The main difference is that web service providers\ntend to explicitly limit the interface of calls or messages a service will respond to, while creators\nof agents may aim to reach the ideal of general social ability for their agents.\nThe reason that general social ability is considered desirable for agents is to future-proof the\nsystem. Designers hope that by giving an agent the ability to respond to messages with content\nnot yet in use, future extensions to the system will be able to ask questions and request services\nof the agent without needing to update the agent. A trivial example is for the temperature\nsensor agent described above to respond to queries for the temperature at a given date to cover\nthe current use case, but also being given the ability to respond to requests for all temperatures\nin a time range in case this is needed in the future.\nThere is a trade-off to be made between development time now versus development time in the\nfuture given the likelihood of such functionality being needed. Much time could be invested in\nallowing an agent to respond to many conceivable queries, but without much chance of recouping\nthe benefit through many system extensions. The \u201cfuture-proof-ness\u201d of a system cannot be\nmeasured, and so there is little way of gauging the concrete benefits of extending agent social\nabilities. The most practical course is to design the agents to be as flexible as possible in handling\nthe current use cases, such as by using the JSA, and trust that future extensions will be able to\nmanage with the agent interfaces this provides.\n13\n2.5.3 The Practical Agent\nIn summary, the theoretical idea of an intelligent agent would take much more development time\nthan is practical for an engineering system, and would not provide substantially improved capa-\nbilities over the practical implementation suggested in this paper. The goal-directed behaviour\nthat seems a clear distinguisher between agent and non-agent systems is in practice difficult to\nachieve, since most agents have a limited set of potential actions they can take, and the state-of-\nthe-art in task decomposition does not allow for detailed reasoning about the capabilities of other\nagents in the system. Social ability is also considered to set agent systems apart from others,\nbut in practice is limited by the designer\u2019s interpretation of the ontology for a given agent.\nWith these considerations in mind, the definition of a practical intelligent agent is one which\nembodies some intelligent system technique, and displays autonomy through two features:\n\u2022 It maintains a thread of execution that is distinct from other programs, i.e. no program or\nexternal system makes calls to the agent\u2019s functions or methods, where execution transfers\nfrom the external system to the agent code and back;\n\u2022 It interfaces with the external world through messaging and taking action in the envi-\nronment, i.e. other agents and external systems can affect the agent\u2019s behaviour only by\nsubmitting messages, or by altering the environment in a way intended to alter the agent\u2019s\nbehaviour (e.g. leaving a pheromone marker in an ant colony simulation).\nThe degree to which the agent maintains autonomy from the agent platform is an implementation\ndetail, and does not affect the first point. The JADE platform, for example, does not instantiate\nseparate agents in separate operating system threads. However, it switches between agents as a\nmini scheduler, meaning that the agents within the platform are kept distinct (as operating sys-\ntem threads are kept distinct within a process). The agent can make calls to platform functions,\nsuch as for sending and receiving messages from the transport layer, but the platform can only\n14\naffect the agent by suspending, migrating, destroying, etc. through requests from the engineer.\nThe platform supports the agent, rather than controlling the agent.\nThe capability of an agent to act autonomously has certain practical benefits for power engi-\nneering applications. Separate applications and algorithms can be implemented and tested as\nisolated systems, in order to ensure correct operation; and then deployed together in the field\nto gain the benefits of information-sharing across systems. This also means that stand-alone\nlegacy systems (which, by their nature, run autonomously) can be integrated into new systems\nand interfaced with new data sources.\nThe following section considers particular examples of practical agent systems in the literature,\nand assesses the contributions they make to the field.\n3 Review\nA 2007 review of the field [3] identified four application areas where agent research was on-\ngoing. One significant area of activity was in agent-based simulation of energy markets, for\nexample [29, 30]. In this paper, we focus on \u201coperational\u201d use of agents rather than simulation:\nagent technology being used as an integration platform for in-field systems deployment. Taking\nthis definition, this section identifies the state-of-the-art in agent system design, by discussing\nsome of the key implementations of power engineering applications.\n3.1 ARCHON\nOne of the earliest examples of an agent-based system in the power domain is ARCHON (AR-\nchitecture for Co-operative Heterogeneous ON-line systems) [31]. The design intention was to\nintegrate a set of pre-existing expert systems for different aspects of distribution network fault\n15\ndiagnosis. Each expert system originally operated in isolation, with an engineer drawing conclu-\nsions about the state of the network from the output of each system.\nThe out-of-sequence SCADA alarms gathered from the network are first processed by the Alarm\nAnalysis Agent, which tries to identify the faulted component. At the same time, a Breakers\nSupervisor agent analyses the correctly-sequenced SCADA data from individual substations. A\nthird agent identifies the extent of the network that was blacked-out, and a fourth agent acts as\nan interface between the agent system and the control room computer system.\nIntegration of the systems allows automatic corroboration of diagnoses. If analysis of the network-\nwide, out-of-order alarms identifies the same faulted component as analysis of the local, chrono-\nlogical alarms, confidence in the diagnosis is higher. The Black-out Area Identifier agent provides\nextra information for Alarm Analysis, which can confirm or alter the fault diagnosis.\nThis system explicitly employed loose coupling of agent messaging interfaces in order to integrate\nlegacy systems in a flexible, alterable way. Each agent was designed to keep the intelligence layer\ndistinct from the social layer, with explicit mappings between them. The aim was to allow\nchanges to the social interactions among agents without having to alter the intelligence layer. In\neffect, the legacy systems can remain the same regardless of the deployment scenario, while the\nagents can come together in varying ways by altering the messaging layers.\nThis capability was exploited in subsequent implementations, where further agents were added\nto the system for switching schedule production and weather monitoring for lightning strike\nlocation [14].\nARCHON used bespoke message formats and protocols in addition to a blackboard-like dis-\ntributed database for information-sharing between agents. The latter avoids the need for trans-\nferring large datasets between agents over the message transport channel, with point-to-point\nand broadcast messaging allowing agents to alert others to updates in the datasets available.\nWhile this approach met the needs of the system at the time, the use of standards for messaging\n16\nallows more openness of the architecture, which was one of the drivers for using the agents\u2019 loose\ncoupling.\nARCHON was supported by Iberdrola, and has been deployed in a control room in Bilbao [32].\nIt was pioneering by showing the potential of multiple autonomous systems linked by loosely\ncoupled interfaces: benefiting the application by corroborating multiple diagnoses, and benefiting\nthe system by flexibly allowing deployment of different sets of agents. While it aimed to be an\nopen architecture that agents from any designer could join, in practice the lack of standardised\nmessaging and the use of a distributed database would hinder this.\n3.2 PEDA\nThe Protection Engineering Diagnostic Agents (PEDA) system was created for post-fault analy-\nsis, using not only SCADA data but also Digital Fault Recorder (DFR) data to diagnose network\nfaults and validate that the protection system operated correctly [33]. Like ARCHON, PEDA\nintegrates a number of legacy intelligent systems in order to improve the diagnostic conclusions\nof the system, while additionally collecting data from and corroborating across multiple sources\nof data via agents that use FIPA-conforming messaging.\nSCADA data is analysed by an Incident and Event Identification agent, which uses an expert\nsystem to classify the type of incident and identify relevant alarms. The information from\nthis agent is used to prioritise retrieval of fault records by the Fault Record Retrieval agent.\nFault records are passed to the Fault Record Interpretation agent, which uses an expert system\nto identify key information such as fault type and clearance times. A Protection Validation\nand Diagnosis agent wraps a model-based reasoning system to check whether the protection\nsystem operated correctly for this fault. Information generated by all these agents is archived\nby a Collation Agent, and an Engineering Assistant Agent presents system conclusions to the\nengineer.\n17\nA number of the PEDA agents were deployed in the UK with SP PowerSystems [34], where certain\npractical issues provided an instructive case study for the use of multi-agent systems in robust\nindustrial applications. Specifically, the stability of the agent platform used for development\nwas under question, which meant the agents deployed upon it were consequently unable to\nrun without crashes. Secondly, the FIPA standards themselves had undergone revision, and\nsome of the messaging did not conform to the new versions of the standards. Finally, the user\nrequirements for the system had changed over time, meaning the engineers wanted robust archival\nof system output.\nIn short, the deployment of this system led to significant advances in understanding of the\nsoftware engineering challenges of a multi-agent system, by requiring techniques and approaches\nto achieve the stability and maintainability required by an industrial system. The agent system\ncan only be as robust as the tools it employs, and the importance of platform selection and long\nterm data storage were highlighted. With the use of FIPA standards for messaging, this system\nwas more open to agents with different designers than ARCHON, but the lack of standards\nversioning information in messages meant the agents had to be updated to conform to latest\nreleases of the standards.\n3.3 COMMAS\nIn addition to network fault diagnosis, agents have been used for diagnosis of faults in items of\nplant. The COndition Monitoring Multi-Agent System (COMMAS) was originally applied to gas\nturbine start-up sequences, before being implemented for transformer condition monitoring [22].\nImplementation and use of this system has continued over many years, and similarly to PEDA,\nthe requirements have changed over this period of time. This section considers the first practical\nimplementation and the shift to a second practical implementation deployed with National Grid.\nThe original implementation aimed to diagnose defects causing partial discharge (PD) behaviour\n18\nwithin a transformer. PD data was gathered from sensors, then a Feature Extraction agent\ncalculated feature vectors from the data. Three pattern recognition techniques were wrapped as\nDiagnosis Agents, which used the feature vectors for defect classification. The three diagnoses\nwere collected by a Corroboration Agent, which made the final diagnosis. An Information Agent\npresented an interface for the engineer.\nAn agent approach was used for extensible system development: since the agents located others\nof the appropriate type through the DF, extra Diagnosis Agents could be added to the system\nand their diagnoses were seamlessly collected by the Corroboration Agent. Development of\nnew Diagnosis Agents was also simplified, since all the messaging behaviours of locating feature\nvectors and providing diagnoses were identical. In the terminology of ARCHON, the intelligence\nlayer differs between different Diagnosis Agents, while the messaging layer is identical.\nThis architecture suited PD monitoring in the laboratory, but had some disadvantages that were\nrevealed as requirements changed. The first issue was that the diagnosis workflow is set by each\ntype of agent looking for the previous type in the chain, making it difficult to insert steps into\nthe workflow. For example, later work inserted anomaly detection capabilities between data\ngathering and feature extraction [35], so that diagnosis of a defect would only be performed if\nthe transformer\u2019s behaviour changed. This required substantial alteration of the messaging layer\nof the Feature Extraction agent, to stop it from seeking sensor data until it received a start signal\nfrom the anomaly detector.\nThe second issue arose when new sources of data were available. In a project with the UK\u2019s\nNational Grid, two transformers were instrumented with temperature, vibration, and current\nsensors with the aim of monitoring for changes in behaviour. The intelligent system technique\nchosen for this was Conditional Anomaly Detection [36], which operated on raw data instead of\nfeature vectors, and did not require a separate stage for corroboration. Since the workflow for\nthis data was so different from the PD data analysis, a whole new set of agents were required to\ninterpret this data.\n19\nTaking these changes in requirements into account, the agent architecture was radically re-\ndesigned. Five different agent roles were defined: data provider, service provider, data director,\narchive, and interface [37]. Data provider agents make data available to the system, by connecting\nto sensors, databases, historical files, or web resources. Service providers perform data interpre-\ntation, such as calculating feature vectors or classifying defects. The archive provides long term\nstorage of information generated by agents. Data directors contain task-specific knowledge al-\nlowing them to make links between data providers and service providers, and ensure information\nis archived. Interface agents provide ways of allowing information out of the system, such as to\na user interface or a second system.\nThis architecture allows the diagnosis workflow to alter based on a given data director\u2019s knowl-\nedge. For the situation of adding anomaly detection to PD monitoring, it would be the data\ndirector that is altered from directing data straight to the feature extraction agent, to sending\nit for anomaly detection prior to feature extraction. This is a significant difference: in the first\nsystem design the feature extraction agent had to change even although the process of extracting\nfeatures remained the same, whereas with the second design the data director changes because\nthe flow of data (the sphere of this agent\u2019s knowledge) has to change.\nThe change in architecture reflects a change in design intention. The new implementation focusses\non handling data from different sources using different techniques in a flexible and extensible way,\nby imposing the five roles required for many condition monitoring applications. This architecture\nwas implemented for the transformer monitoring application described above, and monitored the\ntransformers on-site for 12 months before decommissioning [36]. It has also been implemented\nfor dissolved gas analysis of historical data and PD analysis of lab samples [37]; deployed on-site\nfor HVDC reactor monitoring [38]; and deployed on a wireless sensor network for transformer\nmonitoring [39].\nWhile condition monitoring is traditionally treated as a distinct application from network mon-\nitoring, diagnosis of any faults or disturbances on the network can give extra information about\ndiagnoses of plant health. The integration of the PEDA and COMMAS systems has been dis-\n20\ncussed [40], with the aim of using knowledge of network events such as high loading to inhibit\nthe raising of alarms for transformer high temperatures or increased PD. Both systems con-\nform to the FIPA standards for agent platform and agent messaging, but since ontology is not\nstandardised, messages generated by one system are unintelligible to the other.\nTo date, this problem has not been fully overcome. The IEEE PES Multi-Agent Systems Working\nGroup recognises it as a barrier to interoperation of agent systems [4], and has developed an\nupper ontology of common terms within the power engineering domain [19]. This can be used\nas the basis for application-specific ontology development, which simplifies system integration to\nsome extent. Systems will likely communicate about high-level concepts such as transformers,\nsubstations, and faults, and the upper ontology provides a data model for such terms.\n3.4 SPID\nCertain events within the power system can lead to cascade tripping, which can rapidly black-out\nlarge portions of the network unnecessarily. The Strategic Power Infrastructure Defence (SPID)\nSystem was created to identify and resolve the types of hidden failure of components that can\nleave the system vulnerable to cascading events [41].\nAgents are organised into three layers. The first set react quickly to events, by sending inhibiting\nsignals to protection devices. At the next level, co-ordination agents use heuristic knowledge to\ndecide if events at the reactive layer need further analysis. Finally the deliberative layer contains\nagents which do longer-term analysis, such as identifying potential hidden failures of components,\nreconfiguring the network, or generating a restoration plan after an incident.\nThe benefits of an agent approach are derived from the autonomy of agents in each layer [41].\nReactive agents can make local decisions and react quickly, compared to deliberative agents that\ngather wide area data before drawing conclusions. At the same time, such a complex system\n21\nmaintains a level of robustness from the independence of each agent: if one ceases to function,\nit will affect others but not necessarily the whole system.\nLater work identified the need for robust tools for implementing such a system, in order to\ndeploy a practical industrial solution [42]. The choice of such tools was presented as an open\nquestion. Since rapid communication is vital for this application, it is unlikely agent messaging\nis FIPA-compliant due to the size of FIPA messages, although the choice of technology is not\nexplicitly stated. This suggests that the architecture is not particularly open, but the application\nof security threat analysis could be used as an argument against an open system.\n3.5 IntelliTEAM II\nS&C Electric Company produce the IntelliTEAM II Automatic Restoration System [43], which\ndecides and executes a restoration plan after isolation of a faulted line section. This is achieved by\ncommunication between agents responsible for adjacent lines. Each agent can control components\nsuch as switches and reclosers on its line, but action can only be taken after agreement with\nneighbouring agents. Each agent checks that its constraints will still be met before agreeing to\nneighbouring actions.\nThe system has been deployed with the ENMAX Power Corporation in Canada on key circuits.\nThis shows the robustness required of industrial applications has been met. However, little\ninformation has been published on the workings of the agents themselves, other than the radio\nsystem employed for communication. A second trial on the Isle of Wight sees monitoring and\nrestoration of an 11kV network, which is susceptible to interruptions due to weather conditions\n[44].\n22\n3.6 PowerMatcher\nA more recent commercial product is PowerMatcher, an agent-based solution to demand man-\nagement in congested or constrained networks [45]. The design intention for this system is to\ndynamically match supply and demand through an open market for trading in a local area.\nEach device has a control agent with knowledge of how they produce or consume power. This\nleads to three types of device agent: stochastic operation agents (such as solar or wind energy\nconverters), shiftable operation agents (such as ventilation or air conditioning systems), and user\naction devices (such as lighting and computers) [45]. In addition, there are three other types of\nagent for operating the market: an auctioneer agent, which finds the equilibrium price point; a\nconcentrator agent, which can represent a cluster of device agents in the auction; and an objective\nagent, which can maintain objectives other than simply balancing supply and demand to, for\nexample, operate a virtual power plant [46]. Through the use of concentrator agents, small local\nmarkets can trade with wider area markets, allowing the computational complexity of the market\nto scale logarithmically [46].\nAgent technology was chosen for this application for reasons of scalability and openness [46]. As\nthe number of devices using PowerMatcher grows, the appropriate agents can be instantiated from\nthe same six agent templates described above, with no additional developer overhead. Since all\nagents are autonomous, the deployment of new devices does not affect the current device agents,\nother than by altering prices fixed through auction. Scalability of computation has been designed\nin to the architecture through the concentrator agents.\nWhile the design and development of the system is considered scalable, in practice it may be\nlimited by implementation of the agent platform. One of the most widely used platforms is\nJADE [26], a Java-based, FIPA-compliant platform that is generally held to produce reliable,\nscalable systems. However, the scalability and robustness of a JADE-based agent system is\nsignificantly impacted by deployment choices, such as whether to deploy agents on a single\n23\nplatform or whether to federate multiple platforms containing subsets of agents [47].\nPowerMatcher does not use the JADE platform, but instead agents run on a FIPA-compliant\nplatform created by the PowerMatcher developers [48]. Little detail of this platform is published,\nbut it is likely that deployment choices and platform implementation will have an effect on\nscalability. The extent of this effect has not been reported.\nOpenness of the PowerMatcher system is a design goal, in order to allow devices with different\ncreators to integrate with the system. Messaging between agents does not currently comply with\nFIPA standards, instead being a proprietary messaging format tailored to the current application\nuse cases [49]. However, it has been recognised that standards-compliant messaging would open\nup the architecture [48], and FIPA-compliant messaging is a goal for future development.\nPowerMatcher is in advanced stages of field testing, with three demonstrator sites of varying sizes\nconfirming that PowerMatcher can perform its required tasks [50]. One test deployed control\nagents with five devices for some months in 2006, with the objective of reducing imbalances\nbetween supply and demand. The second field test grouped five micro-CHP devices as a virtual\npower plant for one month in 2007, with the aim of reducing the peak load of the local network.\nThe third and largest test is called PowerMatcher City, where agents are deployed with 100\ncontrollable devices, split across 30 households and two laboratories. This third test is still\nongoing.\n3.7 AuRA-NMS\nTaking a very different approach to congestion management, the Autonomous Regional Active\nNetwork Management System (AuRA-NMS) was designed to encompass multiple techniques for\noperating distribution networks more efficiently. This involved automating the decision-making\nrequired for power flow management, voltage control, and network optimisation, using agent\n24\ntechnology as an integration platform for some or all of these techniques.\nWhile other network control research has suggested the use of agents, AuRA-NMS takes a sig-\nnificantly different design approach [51]. Instead of allocating an agent to each device in the\nnetwork, AuRA-NMS splits agents along functional boundaries, giving each agent in the system\nautonomous capabilities for tackling different tasks such as voltage control or power flow manage-\nment. The specific techniques tested are constraint programming, current tracing, and optimal\npower flow for power flow management; and case-based reasoning and constraint programming\nfor voltage control [52,53].\nAs with ARCHON, the loose coupling of the messaging interface is the key agent feature that gives\ntangible benefit to this application, rather than the scalable development offered by instantiating\nmultiple agents of the same type that is exploited by PowerMatcher. This has the interesting\neffect of allowing flexible geographical deployment of agents where computing resources allow it\nand where the utility desires.\nFor example, one proposed field trial would deploy power flow management functionality dis-\ntributed across three substations, while a second field trial would retain all computation within\nthe utility\u2019s control room [53]. The location of agents for these trials is simply a choice, not a\nrequirement, as the agents are not tied to specific items of plant. The first field trial is currently\nongoing.\nSimilarly to the condition monitoring application of COMMAS, openness and future integration\nwith other systems is highly desirable for AuRA-NMS. As such, the same issues of standards-\ncompliance and ontology choice will affect the level to which it is practically possible to create an\nopen architecture. Any progress which is made in one of these areas should be directly applicable\nto the other.\n25\n3.8 INTEGRAL\nINTEGRAL is an EU programme which aims to develop an ICT platform for distributed con-\ntrol of electrical networks based on commonly available ICT components, standards, and tech-\nnologies [54]. A key element of the INTEGRAL programme is demonstration of the proposed\nplatform under a number of different network conditions: normal conditions (managing DER to\nminimise cost); critical conditions (maintaining stability); and emergency conditions (restoration\nof supply). The programme has three different pilot deployments, each deployment focusing on\na particular condition. Agent technology features in all three pilots.\nThe pilot for normal network conditions, in the Netherlands, uses PowerMatcher, which we have\nalready discussed in section 3.6.\nFor critical network conditions, a site trial in Spain uses MAS technology for the control of\na microgrid [54]. Based on earlier work [55], agents are used to match supply and demand\nwith the microgrid in response to grid events. The microgrid is connected to a UPS which is\nused to simulate a grid connection. Loads and generators within the microgrids are managed\nfrom a central PC which communicates via Zigbee with embedded controllers on each of the\nloads/generators. The central PC hosts a multi-agent system, implemented using JADE, which\nmanages devices on the microgrid. The architecture of the MAS is such that each controllable\ndevice is assigned a local control agent. The local control agent manages the control of that\nindividual device. A single microgrid central controller agent is responsible for the co-ordination\nof the local control agents and thus the whole system.\nAgent concepts also play a role, allbeit more limited, within the emergency conditions pilot of\nINTEGRAL. The third pilot aims to demonstrate self-healing in response to faults, i.e. automatic\nsupply restoration [56]. In terms of MAS design and implementation, a single intelligent agent\nis responsible for restoration within an area of network known as a cell. Performance of the\nagent and the underlying ICT infrastructure on which it relies is being tested on a low voltage\n26\nlaboratory-based test network, which has been sized to represent a real 20 kV area of distribution\nnetwork in France [57].\n4 Interest in Agents and Smart Grids\nAs networks become \u201csmarter\u201d, more flexible and automated, utilities and researchers are looking\nfor platforms and technologies that can support a system of complex, interacting, sometimes\ncompeting functionality. The requirement is to allow different objectives, such as power flow\nmanagement, voltage regulation, and automated restoration, to co-exist harmoniously within the\nsmart grid management system. Data and measurements should be available to all functionality\nthat requires it, while actions taken to meet one objective should not negatively impact another\nunless a negotiated agreement has been reached.\nVarious bodies have recognised the need for standards and platforms to support this vision.\nEPRI\u2019s IntelliGrid architecture [58] and the US Department of Energy\u2019s GridWise Architec-\nture [59] are two such industrially-backed efforts at standardisation. These architectures are\nexplicitly technology-agnostic, specifying the required functionality of a smart grid platform\nwithout suggesting particular implementations. At a high level, both architectures require plat-\nforms to allow interoperability of functionality, extensibility, and reliability.\nMulti-agent systems aim to embody these features, making agent technology a strong contender\nfor delivery of smart grid capability. Interoperability through standards-conformance, extensi-\nbility through deployment of newer agents, and reliability through distributed deployment of\nagents offering redundant functionality are accepted strengths of agent-based system design [3].\nMany researchers are investigating the design of agent systems to address smart grid questions,\nas evidenced by a wealth of recent publications [51,53,60\u201386].\nWhile it is early for physical demonstrators and field trials of these applications, it is anticipated\n27\nthat agent technology will continue to grow in popularity, as it offers the means of creating the\nflexible, extensible, and robust systems required for the smart grid.\n5 Challenges\nThe progress of these systems towards industrial implementations and demonstrators shows that\nagent technology can be used to build robust systems from autonomous components. However,\nthere still remain some practical challenges to wide-spread deployment of multi-agent systems\nwithin power engineering. These can be summarised as ensuring a system design will deliver\nthe required functionality, whether that functionality is a technical capability or an industry\nrequirement.\nThe first aspect of this is how to design an agent system. Many methodologies exist (some\nlisted in [4]), but the choice of methodology will greatly influence the final structure of the\narchitecture. Most methodologies design from a top-down perspective, where an engineering\ntask such as condition monitoring or post fault analysis is broken down into successive subtasks\nuntil they seem appropriate for agent behaviours. This will produce a system that meets the\nrequired functional capability for the current use case, but may be limited in extensibility to\nfuture expansions. Specifically, the social ability of the agents will be limited to creating and\nunderstanding the messages required to perform the high level task.\nAn alternative is to design from a bottom-up perspective, considering what actions and messaging\ncapabilities an agent should have given its knowledge of the world. A fully bottom-up approach\nwould fall into the trap described earlier, of investing much development effort into aspects that\nare not required for the current use case with the aim of future-proofing the system, but may\nnever be required in the future.\nTherefore, a balance between top-down and bottom-up design seems appropriate, with the design\n28\nemphasis more on a top-down approach to meeting current use cases. However, the current use\ncases can be quite complex, for example by allowing the autonomy of agents to flexibly change\nat run-time. Research into degrees of autonomy has considered the circumstances in which it is\nappropriate for robots within a team to act independently versus co-ordinating behaviour with\nothers [87, 88]. This work presented various use cases in which robots had to act autonomously\nfor timely response to environmental events, but in other situations take orders from others in\norder to meet the team\u2019s objectives. Choosing the appropriate degrees of autonomy for agents\nwithin the power system is an important question not yet explored within the industry.\nFinally, designers must have ways of verifying that once implemented, agents will behave in\nthe expected ways in order to robustly continue to meet its design objectives. Validation and\nverification of agent code is in many ways like assessing the correctness of any software system,\nwith the possible interactions of various agents both simplifying and adding complexity to the\ntask.\nSince agents operate as autonomous components they can be thoroughly tested as stand-alone\nunits, entirely analogously to unit testing of software classes. External systems such as other\nagents can be simulated through mocking [89], where the intended responses are hard-coded into\na mock agent, thus decoupling the behaviour of agents within the system for test purposes. Since\nmany tools and frameworks exist for unit testing and mocking, agent testing is no more difficult\nthan standard unit testing, relying as it does on defining a test set with appropriate coverage to\nensure all behaviours are exercised.\nHowever, by using FIPA standards for messaging, the number of legitimate messages that could\npotentially be sent to an agent is practically infinite. This complicates the task of ensuring an\nagent cannot be damaged by unexpected input, as the test set of messages may be much larger\nand more complex than a test set of parameters for standard unit testing of a software function.\nFurther, the asynchronous interaction of agents means that they are potentially more sensitive\nto the timing and order of messages received from multiple sources, which can require test sets\nof the same messages sent at varying intervals to get full coverage.\n29\nSoftware verification is not a new area, and there is nothing inherent about agent design that\nrequires more or less effort expended on testing. However, the testing procedure for an agent\nsystem is something rarely discussed in publications on the use of agents in industry, and if\nagent-based systems are to be deployed for safety critical or safety related applications in the\npower industry, it is an area that must be given consideration.\n6 Conclusion\nThis paper has discussed the theoretical and practical benefits that multi-agent systems technol-\nogy can bring to power engineering applications. Through a review of some of the key agent-based\nsystems in the literature, the progress of this technology towards robust industrial installations\nhas been shown, culminating in ongoing field trials and commercial products currently avail-\nable. Each of these demonstrators covers a different strand of the functionality envisioned for\nthe smart grid concept, showing through example that multi-agent systems can provide the\nintegrating technology for such a complex system.\nHowever, there are still some aspects of agent design and implementation that could be im-\nproved. Design methodology, degrees of autonomy, and verification and testing have not been\nfully explored in the literature, and further research would benefit engineering agent systems.\nWith this in mind, further demonstration systems and industrial deployments are required, to\ncontinue advancing the practice of multi-agent design.\nReferences\n[1] SmartGrids, \u201cVision and strategy for Europe\u2019s electricity networks of the future,\u201d 2006,\navailable http://www.smartgrids.eu/.\n30\n[2] V.
