Page 6 | Long-run Patterns of Labour Market Polarisation: Evidence from German Micro Data  2 Introduction The past four decades have seen dramatic changes in the structure of employment. As documented by Autor et al. (1998), the US witnessed a large reduction in the employment of middle skill workers. At the same time, there have been increases in the employment of high skill, and to some extent, low skill workers. This pattern of em-ployment polarisation has also been demonstrated for the UK by Goos/Manning (2007) and across Europe by Goos et al. (2009), and is likely to continue in the future (Autor 2015). These changes have been ascribed to the fact that these middle skill jobs involved tasks that were intensively routine in nature. As a result, they were most readily substituted with capital as computer technology became cheaper (Autor et al. 2003). This same technology is factor augmenting to high skilled workers which in turn leads to a growth of complementary, high skill, non-routine intensive jobs. Along these lines, Autor et al. (1998) demon-strate that increased employment of high-skill labour largely occurred within computer intensive industries. The growth in low-skill employment that has occurred has also been concentrated in jobs that are not routine intensive (e.g. personal services). One argument is that this reflects a compositional change in consumption due to the in-crease in high skill workers (Mazzolari, Ragusa 2013). This literature provides a compelling view of the impact of structural change on the labour market over the past four decades. With this said, the existing empirical evidence largely takes the form of comparisons of decade upon decade employment numbers and shares at aggregated levels of occupational detail. Until relatively re-cently, the dynamics of employment transitions implicit in the process of polarisation have been inferred from comparisons of these cross-sectional changes. An almost wholly US literature has developed that uses micro data to examine the contribution of different flows to the evolution of employment polarisation. For instance, both Jaimovich/Siu (2012) and Smith (2013) highlight the decline in inflows to routine work particularly from unemploy-ment. The latter paper in addition provides some evidence of increases in inflows into high and low skilled employment, and more generally that overall job finding rates into non-routine jobs have been rising. Along simi-lar lines, Cortes et al. (2014) examine which specific labour market flows can account for rising job market polarization. They find that the disappearance of routine jobs is mainly due to falling worker flows from both un-employment and non-participation to routine employment, and to rising worker flows from routine employment to non-participation. For Germany, Bechara (2017) finds that the employment contraction in routine occupations is largely attributable to young workers and women who increasingly leave routine-intensive jobs and subsequently enter other occupations or into non-participation.1 In practice, little is known regarding the actual process of job-loss and reemployment at the individual worker level, particularly the nature of individual worker transitions that result from the reduction in demand for routine intensive work. This seems an important gap in our knowledge as any potential losses due to this pattern of struc-tural change is likely to be most concentrated among routine workers. An exception is the recent paper by Cortes (2016) who uses the Panel Studies of Income Dynamics (PSID) to look at long-run effects of labour-market polari-zation in the US. He finds evidence of selection on ability for workers switching out of routine jobs. In particular, while low-ability routine workers are more likely to switch to non-routine manual jobs, high-ability routine workers are more likely to switch to non-routine cognitive jobs. With respect to wages, his results suggest that workers staying in routine jobs experience less wage growth than workers staying in any other type of occupation. This is characterised by a reduction in the wage premium for routine occupations of 17% between 1972 and the mid-2000s. Furthermore, Cortes et al. (2014) use CPS data to analyse what role labour market flows play for the dis-appearance of routine jobs in the US since the 1980s. This paper uses administrative data for Germany to characterise the individual level patterns underlying the pro-cess of labour market polarization. Our data is particularly well suited to addressing these issues as it allows us to                                                      1 In contrast to our paper, Bechara (2017) focuses on occupational inflow and outflow rates at the 2-digit level as well as differences between men and women in this context. Long-run Patterns of Labour Market Polarisation: Evidence from German Micro Data  | Page 7  follow individuals across a long span of time. Specifically we can examine individual level transitions but also how these have changed over the past four decades. In doing so we provide evidence on the secular pattern of polari-sation over a long time period at a high frequency of observation. As a result, we can characterise the evolution of polarisation over time. In addition, we provide evidence on a range of individual level job transitions. Initially, we provide a range of descriptive evidence on the relative job stability, unemployment experiences and job-to-job transitions for routine task intensive workers. We then move to multivariate analysis in an attempt to assess the role of compositional effects. Finally, we provide suggestive evidence on welfare losses, in terms of unemploy-ment duration and job instability related to employment polarisation. The contribution of our paper to the existing literature on routinisation is therefore twofold. First, we are, to the best of our knowledge, the first to provide encompassing micro evidence on the long-run effects of labour-market polarization for a European country, thus complementing the evidence provided by Cortes (2016) and Cortes et al. (2014) for the US. Second, our analysis goes beyond the existing literature by providing detailed evidence on the nature of the labour market experiences of routine workers, also taking into account occupation-specific measures of task intensity that vary over time. This type of analysis is only possible with the type of panel data at our disposal, which we complement with survey information on occupational task content, i.e. routine intensity. The paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we provide information on the data used including the ad-ministrative data set as well as the data on the task intensity of different occupations. The third section presents the empirical methodology, while the fourth section reports and discusses the results, and the final section sum-marizes and concludes the discussion. Page 8 | Long-run Patterns of Labour Market Polarisation: Evidence from German Micro Data  3 Data 3.1 Worker-level data Our main data source is the Sample of Integrated Labour Market Biographies (SIAB) for 1975-2014, which is pro-vided by the Institute for Employment Research (IAB). The SIAB is a representative 2% random sample of the Integrated Employment Biographies (IEB) which contains the labour market history of all individuals in Germany that are employed subject to social security contributions, those in part-time employment not earning enough to make social security contributions, those receiving unemployment or social benefits, and those officially regis-tered as job-seeking at the German Federal Employment Agency or participating in programs of active labour market policies. Civil servants and self-employed workers are not included in the data.2 The information on labour market states is exact to the day. A detailed description of the Sample of Integrated Labour Market Biographies is provided in vom Berge et al. (2013). The SIAB provides information on workers\u2019 employment status, age, gender, occupation and education as well as limited information on establishment characteristics (economic sector, establishment size). This data set is repre-sentative for all dependent-status workers, and contains information on all employment and unemployment spells of the workers covered. From this sample, we further exclude, apprentices, trainees, homeworkers, and individu-als older than 65.3 In line with previous research we focus on male full-time workers aged 18-65. As our period (1975-2014) covers the pre-unification period, we focus on West Germany only. The data allows us to characterise individuals as being in one of three labour market states at any point in time: employment covered by social security (E), unemployment with benefit receipt (U), and non-participation (N). Non-participants are those individuals not recorded in the data sets. Therefore, this state includes those workers out of the labour market, as well as workers not covered by social security legislation, e.g. civil servants and self-employed workers. Because of the way the data are collected, both establishments\u2019 reports of a new employee and individuals\u2019 notifi-cations of moving into or out of unemployment may not be exactly consistent with the actual change of labour market state. For example, workers might report to the unemployment office only a few days after they are laid off. We take this potential measurement error into account in the following way: If the time lag between two em-ployment spells at different establishments does not exceed 30 days, this is defined as a direct transition between the two states recorded. We count it as an intervening spell of non-employment if the time interval between the two records is larger than 30 days. Since the data set used contains daily information on the employment and unemployment history of every individ-ual in the sample, it is possible to calculate worker flows taking into account every change of labour market state that occurs to an individual within a given time period. We are thus able to compute the flows between employ-ment and non-employment, as well as direct job-to-job transitions (EE flows) using the establishment identification number.                                                      2 Caliendo/Uhlendorff (2008) find that only 3% of all non-employed workers and only 1% of all wage-employed workers  in Germany enter the state of self-employment annually, implying that transitions into and out of this state only play a minor role for our analyses. 3 Excluding part-time workers from our sample and treating them as non-participants artificially increases our transitions into and out of non-participation. However, as the SIAB data only distinguish between two categories of part-time employment and the number of working hours can be relatively low, we decided to focus on core full-time workers. Long-run Patterns of Labour Market Polarisation: Evidence from German Micro Data  | Page 9  3.2 Measuring routine intensity and related worker flows The analysis of the employment consequences of routinisation requires the classification of employment into oc-cupations according to task types. In the literature there exist two broad approaches to this. The first is a parsimonious approach as per Goos/Manning (2007), Goos et al. (2009) and Cortes (2016) whereby workers are assigned to routine, non-routine manual and non-routine cognitive categories based on groups of standardised occupational codes. A chief virtue of this approach is that it does not require the measurement of task content at an occupational level, while using relatively aggregated occupational information makes this approach more ro-bust to periodic reclassifications of disaggregated occupational classifications. This comes at the potential cost of the introduction of measurement error due both to within-occupational variation in task intensity, and changes in occupational task intensity over time. The second approach, as in Autor et al. (2003), relies on occupational task analysis from additional sources to classify jobs in terms of task intensity. In the US context this comes from the Dictionary of Occupation Titles (DOT) (and later O*NET) information on the task composition of occupations. This information is generated from periodic expert evaluations of job task content. This approach more clearly mitigates some of the issues of meas-urement error inherent in the first approach. However, the relative infrequency of DOT still leads to likely variation between the defined task content of an occupation and what tasks any given worker\u2019s job is likely to actually con-sist of as one moves further away from the DOT date. One of the aims of the O*NET replacement was to limit this information lag by providing more frequent job task information. In the German context, the main approaches used in the literature to date can be viewed as alternatives of this DOT approach where, instead of expert evaluations, survey-based information on task content is used. This re-flects the availability of data from BIBB/IAB and BIBB/BAuA Employment Surveys (herein BIBB data) that provide a representative sample of workers and include questions regarding the task content of jobs.4 In previous work, three different task intensity measures have been generated using this data. Spitz-Oener (2006) and Antonczyk et al (2009) generate different measures of relative task intensity at occupation levels using worker self-reports on the task content of their work. While Baumgarten (2015) computes an alternative measure of routinisation focus-ing on the use of tools on the job.  We follow the approach of Antonczyk et al (2009) and categorize the activities employees perform at the work-place into routine (R), non-routine cognitive (NRC) and non-routine manual tasks (NRM). This is computed for 54 occupational categories following Tiemann et al. (2008), and for each occupation-time period combination pro-vides a R, NRC and NRM share that sums to 100%. This measure can be expressed as:  TIijt= \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc61  (1) As an example, for routine tasks, this implies taking the number of routine tasks performed by a person at a spe-cific point in time, and relating this to the total number of activities performed in all task categories (routine, non-routine manual and non-routine cognitive). Taking the averages of individual task intensities provides a continu-ous measure of Routine Task Intensity (RTI) over time for a given occupational group.5 A key advantage of this data is that the survey is conducted at regular six to seven year intervals throughout our period of analysis (1979, 1985/86, 1991/92, 1998/99, 2006 and 2012). This allows us to have time-varying task intensity by occupational groups. As mentioned above, earlier literature has tried to explain the long-term relative decline of different task intensities, while other research has focused on quite short periods. In both cases this leads naturally to an approach where occupation task intensity is fixed at an initial or pre-sample period. A focus                                                      4 Details about how we deal with the different waves of the task data set are spelt out in the appendix. 5 In unreported estimates we use the alternative approach set out by Spitz-Oener (2006). The nature of our re-sults are largely unaffected by this. Page 10 | Long-run Patterns of Labour Market Polarisation: Evidence from German Micro Data  of our paper is how worker outcomes at a particular time period are influenced by exposure to different task mixes. Hence, it seems inappropriate to, for instance, examine outcomes of workers in the 1990s based on the task intensity of their occupation fixed at 1979 values. Our main approach is to use the BIBB data to update occu-pation task intensities over time. This has the advantage that worker outcomes are evaluated more closely to their actual task composition at the time of observation. A cost of this approach is that, when compared to using initial task values only, there is the potential of marked discontinuities in the task intensity shares at BIBB survey dates. These are not large in practice in terms of contin-uous measures of task intensity. However, any analysis that, like previous work, is based on categorising workers into different, discrete task intensity groups (e.g. R, NRM and NRC) faces a naturally greater probability of discon-tinuities at BIBB survey dates in the proportion of occupations (and hence workers) belonging to any given task group. We use a number of approaches to dealing with this issue, but stress that none of these choices \u2018drive\u2019 our results. Initially we provide descriptive evidence that aims at being comparable with longer, but \u2018snapshot\u2019 based, evidence for the US, UK and elsewhere. In doing so, we adopt a similar approach to this particular strand of the literature and fix occupations into three categories at the start of the data. These categories are: i. Routine (R): Administrative support, operatives, maintenance and repair occupations, production and transportation occupations (among others). ii. Non-Routine Cognitive (NRC):  Professional, technical, management, business and financial occupa-tions. iii. Non-Routine Manual (NRM): Service workers. Our next step is to try to examine the evolution of worker outcomes over the periods, focusing on two sets of complementary outcomes. First, we seek to provide results on the effect of RTI on the employment probabilities of workers over the short run (one year) and long run (five years). Note that this means that our analyses using the RTI measure start in 1979, whereas the analyses using the three task groups start in 1975; furthermore, the analyses following individual workers for 5 years stop in 2008 in order to avoid the problem of right-censoring. We then subsequently extend this to duration modelling of the effect of RTI on labour market transitions more broadly. In both of these cases, we use RTI as a continuous measure. We deal with the issue of revisions of oc-cupational task shares across BIBB waves by splitting our data into a number of BIBB-Survey data specific periods (e.g. 1979-1984; 1985-1991; 1992-1998; 1999-2005; 2006-2011 and 2012 to present). This allows us to provide evidence on how the effect of task intensity on worker outcomes has changed over the past 3 decades. We again stress, however, that the main thrust of our findings are not materially affected by alternative ap-proaches such as pooling our data across the whole survey period.  Long-run Patterns of Labour Market Polarisation: Evidence from German Micro Data  | Page 11  4 Methodology 4.1 Descriptive Evidence We first provide descriptive evidence that aims to paint a picture of the labour market situation of workers accord-ing to the task content of their work. Specifically, we provide univariate descriptive statistics on the evolution of task-specific employment shares and unemployment rates, and transition rates between different labour market states and task categories. We exploit a particular strength of our data and examine how these patterns have changed over a long period. In the first step of our descriptive analysis, we provide evidence on employment stocks for the three task catego-ries. To aid comparability over time we adopt a variant of the classification approach used by Cortes (2015) and group occupations into task categories that are fixed across time (see Appendix tables A1 to A3). This has the additional benefit of allowing us to more readily compare changes in occupational/task structure in Germany to existing evidence for the US and elsewhere. We then turn to the BIBB data to provide evidence where, as de-scribed above, we allow the task shares of given occupations to vary reflecting underlying changes in job content over time. The distribution of each task type for each wave is provided using the occupation-level employment shares from the BIBB survey data. Finally, we take the occupational level task measures generated from the BIBB data to the SIAB data. This allows the task shares of employment to vary in between BIBB waves according to annual changes in occupational employment. This, in theory, allows for any cyclical variations in task shares to be apparent. In practice, all three approaches provide an estimate of the share of tasks in the labour market at a point in time. As we discuss in the results, these are not always entirely congruent, but provide similar views on the change in task shares over the entire period.  We then proceed from this to examine worker transitions between labour market states, again paying particular attention to the three task groups. In order to do so, we first display a transition matrix between workers employed in the different task groups and unemployed workers who were previously employed in these three task groups. This provides evidence on the probability of a switch between task groups, both directly (job-to-job) and indirectly (through unemployment). Next, we compute the probability of job exit by task group over time. This yields a measure of job stability for routine, non-routine manual and non-routine cognitive workers. We then examine where workers who have separated from their previous job, and who make a direct job-to-job transition, end up in terms of task category. In a similar vein, we provide evidence on unemployed workers according to the task affili-ation in their previous job. We thus show the evolution of the unemployment exit rates by task type over time, as well as the destination task groups where workers end up. 4.2 Econometric Analysis  With this as initial information, we then examine how the employment probabilities of workers with a given RTI evolve over the short (one year) and medium (five years) term. In order to investigate the determinants of these employment probabilities, we estimate logit models of the form  \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f[\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 = 1|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 , \ud835\udefd, \ud835\udefc, \ud835\udefe] = \u039b(\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udefd + \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udefe)  (2) where \u039b(.) is the logistic cdf with \u03bb(z) = ez/(1 + ez). Xit is a vector of individual- and job-specific variables including age, skill level, economic sector, firm size, region (Bundesland) fixed effects, month dummies, as well as the re-gional unemployment rate. To avoid issues regarding discontinuous changes in RTI due to changes in BIBB based classifications we stack observations from each BIBB year (1979, 1985, 1992, 1999, 2006, 2012). As a Page 12 | Long-run Patterns of Labour Market Polarisation: Evidence from German Micro Data  result, RTI is the routine task intensity of ith individuals job at time t described in equation (1) above. \u03b2 is the coef-ficient of interest and provides the conditional (average) effect of RTI on an individual\u2019s future employment probability. We include BIBB wave dummies in all models. In the empirical results we extend (2) in a number of ways. One main extension relates to time variation and non-linearities in task effects. Estimates of \u03b2 provide the average effect of RTI on employment outcomes of workers across our period of observation. A main interest is in how this has changed over time. To examine this we first interact RTI with a time trend. This provides an estimate of changes in the employment effect of RTI over time. We subsequently include industrial sector \u2013 time interactions to isolate this RTI-time effect separately from sector \u2013 year specific shocks to employment.  Any differential patterns in employment by task group that are revealed reflect a range of underlying types of la-bour market transitions, including those related to job loss and re-employment patterns. To examine this we again provide descriptive evidence related to job loss rates and re-employment rates by task group. This is provided overall and by decade, and with a focus on the extent to which re-employment occurs within the same task type or via transitions to alternative types. This is important as it provides evidence of where routine job workers go after job loss. Do they experience lower re-employment probabilities (and hence are more likely to experience longer unemployment durations)? Examining this again leads directly into multivariate analysis. The most appropriate approach is to estimate mod-els that recognise the underlying duration nature of the data. This leads to the estimation of hazard rate models. As our dataset contains daily information on individual workers\u2019 employment histories, we use a semi-parametric specification in continuous time, i.e. a piecewise-constant exponential (PCE) model. As the PCE model is a pro-portional hazard model, the conditional hazard rate of leaving employment \u03bb(t|X,RTI) satisfies the separability condition:  \ud835\udf06(\ud835\udc61|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 , \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udf060(\ud835\udc61)exp (\ud835\udefe\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61) (3) where X is a vector of individual, potentially time-varying, characteristics, and \u03bb0 denotes the baseline hazard. Again, RTI measures the task intensity of the ith worker\u2019s job and \u03b2 is the parameter of interest. The PCE model assumes that the baseline hazard is constant within a specified time interval, and thus follows a step function with k segments.  \u03bb0(t) = \u03bbj, aj\u22121 \u2264 t < aj, j = 1, ..., k. (4) We specify six such segments: 0 to 30 days of employment duration, 31 to 182 days, 183 to 365 days, 366 to 1095 days, 1096 to 2920 days, and more than 2920 days. We estimate (3) separately for job to job, job to unem-ployment transitions, and unemployment to job transitions. The first set of estimates provides an estimate of the impact of RTI on overall job stability. The second relates to the potentially most negative outcome, job loss coinci-dent with unemployment. While the last provides estimates of the effect of RTI on ongoing difficulties in re-entering employment. An issue with this last set of estimates is how to define an unemployed individual\u2019s RTI. Our approach is to use the RTI of their last employment spell. This has the added effect that we can only estimate these models for unemployed individuals who we observe in our data in a job prior to this.  Even though we control for a wide array of observable characteristics, the hazard rates of observationally equiva-lent individuals may still differ from each other. Ignoring such unobserved heterogeneity in duration models produces incorrect results (cf. Lancaster 1990). To account for unobserved heterogeneity, the proportional hazard model is extended to allow for a multiplicative unobserved heterogeneity term u, which yields a mixed propor-tional hazard model.6 The hazard function then becomes:                                                      6 See van den Berg (2001) for a survey of this model class.

The heterogeneity term is shared across different spells of a given individual, causing observations within groups to be correlated. In all duration models our control vector, X, largely follows that for (2). We include industry, region, year fixed ef-fects and regional unemployment rates to capture differences in economic conditions over time and across regions. Again, we explore time variation and non-linearities in the effect of exposure to different levels of RTI on labour market outcomes.  Page 14 | Long-run Patterns of Labour Market Polarisation: Evidence from German Micro Data  5 Results 5.1 The Evolution of Task Shares and Intensities 1979 to 2013 Figure 1 displays the annual employment shares by task type for the period 1975 to 2014 based on the initial, Cortes style, classification approach. It is clear that the employment share of routine jobs has strongly declined over the time period under observation, from 69% in 1975 to 48% in 2014 for men (Figure 1a). This represents a dramatic reduction in the employment share for these types of jobs. By contrast, the employment shares of non-routine manual have increased from 12% to 20% and from 19% to 32% for non-routine cognitive jobs during the same time period. Again, this fits broadly with the existing evidence for other countries.7 For comparison, we also provide the corresponding figure for female workers (Figure 1b). While the levels of the task types differ, the pat-terns of change over the period are essentially the same. The notable difference is that non-routine cognitive tasks become the predominant job type for women after 2009.  Figure 1a: Employment shares of task categories, 1975-2014, men  Source: SIAB 1975-2014, own calculation. The relatively smooth nature of this process over the period is also noticeable. Our data suggest that polarization has been an on-going, gradual, process in Germany. Moreover, there is little evidence of substantive cyclical vari-ations, or at the least these variations are dominated by the secular patterns. This is important as, based on decennial comparisons, the existing literature has sometimes suggested that polarisation has been concentrated in specific decades or                                                       7 For instance, Goos et al. (2014) find for 16 European countries that while the employment shares of the highest-paying occupations (mainly characterized by non-routine cognitive tasks) have increased over the time period 1993-2010, the employment shares of the middle-paying occupations (mainly routine jobs) have declined. 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.819751977197919811983198519871989199119931995199719992001200320052007200920112013Routine NRC NRMLong-run Patterns of Labour Market Polarisation: Evidence from German Micro Data  | Page 15  Figure 1b: Employment shares of task categories, 1975-2014, women  Source: SIAB 1975-2014, own calculation. episodes. At the same time previous research that focuses on relatively short periods has suggested that busi-ness cycle dynamics may speed up the polarisation process. To our knowledge, this is the first time that evidence has been provided allowing for a long-period, and relatively high frequency, view of the polarisation process. As an alternative view of the same process, Figure 2 provides the average share of workers\u2019 job task intensities across the 6 BIBB waves. These numbers result, in effect, from computing the intensities of R, NRC and NRM tasks from the BIBB survey data. This differs from Figure 1 insofar as (a) it provides a measure of overall \u2018routine-ness\u2019 of work across time (and of the overall intensity in NRC and NRM) and (b) by using the BIBB information we allow the task intensities of any given occupation to change over time. Nonetheless, the general view is the same. There has been a marked reduction in routine task intensity over the past 35 years. The drop is steady from 54% of all tasks in 1979 to about 30% in 2006. After this point there is essentially no change in the routine task share.8 Despite the high frequency of the BIBB surveys, the task intensities sometimes change markedly at the beginning of each BIBB period. The reason behind is twofold. First, holding the task intensities constant within the BIBB pe-riods ignores within-occupation changes and causes a dramatic change at the period beginnings. Second, the questions in the BIBB surveys vary to some extent over time. We therefore focus on the survey questions that are repeated across waves, and furthermore merge specific questions with similar content to adjust the number of questions in order to obtain a similar number of questions in each wave and task category.                                                      8 In addition to our baseline approach, we applied further specifications to estimate the task intensities. The de-creasing pattern of routine task intensity is visible in all approaches. See Figure A1 for more detail on the different approaches applied. 00.10.20.30.40.50.619751977197919811983198519871989199119931995199719992001200320052007200920112013Routine NRC NRMPage 16 | Long-run Patterns of Labour Market Polarisation: Evidence from German Micro Data  Figure 2: Average Task Intensities of Employment from the BIBB data  Source: BIBB/BAuA/IAB surveys, own calculation.

Finally, Figure 3 reports the routine task share where we weight the BIBB occupation task share by the SIAB em-ployment data. As both represent samples of the same underlying population, the overall patterns of the evolution of task shares are quite similar. However, this approach allows for within BIBB period variation in task shares and hence variation from more short-term employment changes. Taken together this provides a body of evidence that there has been a quite dramatic reduction in routine-intensive tasks in Germany since the 1970s. 00.10.20.30.40.50.61975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015NRCI RTI NRMI00.10.20.30.40.50.61975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015RTI NRCI NRMILong-run Patterns of Labour Market Polarisation: Evidence from German Micro Data  | Page 17  Are these changes in task shares associated with differing worker compensation over the period? Table 1 pre-sents unconditional mean differences of wages according to task group. A number of points are worth emphasising. The pattern for wages shows a clear ordering of non-routine cognitive workers, routine workers then non-routine manual workers. This fits with the distribution of these skills predominantly over higher, medium and lower skills occupations, respectively. More importantly, for our purposes these wage gaps appear to be in-creasing over time. This, when combined with the earlier evidence is suggestive of a process of quantity adjustments (employment) to labour demand for routine tasks workers.

Figure 4: Task-specific unemployment rates, 1979-2014  Source: SIAB 1975-2014, own calculation. Given these reductions in employment, an obvious question to ask is whether this has led to changes in the un-employment levels associated with previously being in a given job-task category. Figure 4 reports task-specific unemployment rates over time. Non-routine cognitive workers and non-routine manual workers feature the lowest and highest unemployment rates, respectively, while the unemployment rate of routine workers is between these two across the period. 0%2%4%6%8%10%12%19751977197919811983198519871989199119931995199719992001200320052007200920112013Routine NRM NRCPage 18 | Long-run Patterns of Labour Market Polarisation: Evidence from German Micro Data  5.2 Descriptive Evidence on the Links between Tasks and Employment Transi-tions. We next provide descriptive evidence on labour market transitions according to job tasks performed by workers. These are most readily reported using discrete categorisation of workers into Routine, Non-Routine Manual and Non-Routine Cognitive groups. The most straightforward means of doing this is, again, in the spirit of Cortes et al (2014). Table 2 provides evidence regarding the transition probabilities from one year to the next between employment in different task types, unemployment, and non-participation. Employment probabilities are highest for non-routine cognitive workers, followed by routine workers and non-routine manual workers. The latter workers also fare worst in terms of job-finding probabilities. Somewhat surprisingly, routine workers have the highest job-finding probabilities, which seems to be an indication of a high level of churning for this type of worker.

It also becomes apparent that direct changes between different task categories for employed workers are uncom-mon, the corresponding annual transition rates are generally below 2%. An exception to this are transition rates from non-routine manual to routine employment, which amount to nearly 6%. Switching task categories is more common for unemployed individuals, although still relatively low. For example, the probability that a (previously) routine worker who is unemployed finds a job as a non-routine cognitive worker is 3.38%. Again, the transition rate from (previously) non-routine manual workers to a routine job is the exception. Non-routine manual workers who are unemployed display an equal probability of being in non-routine manual work and of being in routine work one year later. Figure 5 provides additional information regarding transitions over time by task type. Specifically, it provides the probability of a job episode ending according to a worker\u2019s task type. The main driving force behind these job exit probabilities seem to be cyclical during most of the observation period, e.g. with an increase during the bursting of the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s. In a similar vein to Figure 1, non-routine manual workers have the highest probability of job exit across the period of 1980-2010. Routine workers have lower job exit probabilities than non-routine manual workers, but higher exit rates than non-routine cognitive workers. Long-run Patterns of Labour Market Polarisation: Evidence from German Micro Data  | Page 19  Figure 5: Probability of job exit, by task categories, 1980-2014  Source: SIAB 1975-2014, own calculation. Note: Job exit defined as making a transition to a different establishment, a different task category, or to unemployment. Figure 6 provides information on transitions conditional on a worker making a job-to-job transition and according to their initial task type. For each task type there are high levels of state dependence. A worker who makes a transition is substantially more likely to move to another job in the same task category. More importantly, there is evidence that this level of state dependence has increased over time for two task types. Both non-routine cogni-tive and non-routine manual workers are more likely to transit between jobs in the same task type at the end of our observation period than at the start. This appears to follow a steady path over time, and is most marked for non-routine manual workers. At the same time as this, routine workers witnessed a marked reduction in this state dependence. Moreover, this change appears to have been driven at least in part by what could be considered movements up the occupational ladder into non-routine cognitive work. This provides initial evidence that part of the patterns seen earlier in Figures 1, 2 and 3 reflect differences in transitions across tasks. Turning to workers who have become unemployed, Figure 7 features the unemployment exit rate of workers in the three task categories. First, it becomes apparent that unemployment exit rates showed a marked decline in the 1980s and early 1990s, reflecting the structural worsening of labour market conditions in Germany. Since the mid-1990s, and particularly since the mid-2000s, this trend has been reversed with unemployment exit rates con-stantly increasing, which is in line with the strengthening performance of the German labour market highlighted by (Dustmann et al. 2014). Somewhat surprisingly, previously routine workers are the most likely group to exit unem-ployment over the entire observation period. As Figure 8 shows, these unemployed workers mainly return to a routine job. Non-routine manual workers also largely    - 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.351980 1990 2000 2010Routine NRM NRCPage 20 | Long-run Patterns of Labour Market Polarisation: Evidence from German Micro Data  Figure 6: Transition shares from employment, conditional on making a transition, by task categories, 1975-2014    Source: SIAB 1975-2014, own calculation. return to the same task category after a spell of unemployment, however with a much lower probability. Many of them actually switch to routine jobs. However, this transition from non-routine manual unemployment to routine employment has become less frequent over the observation period.

Employed workers are stacked in 6-7 year intervals (i.e. according to the BIBB wave years described above: 1979, 1985, 1992 etc.) in order to estimate the probability of remaining in employment after one year and five years, respectively, using the logit model described in equation (2). We include a range of controls along with our variable of interest, the RTI of the job. The resultant estimates are presented in Table 3. The first column provides the average conditional effect of RTI exposure on employment probability at t+1. This demonstrates that higher RTI is associated with a lower probability of still being in employment one year in the future. The corresponding marginal effect amounts to -0.026. Since RTI is measured on a 0-1 continuum, this marginal effect can be interpreted as a 2.6 percentage point reduction in the likelihood of being employed one year later if a worker moved from a job with zero routine task intensity to a job that is entirely routine. As such a change in RTI is unrealistic, we compute the change in employment probability if the RTI of a job increases by one standard deviation. The standard deviation of RTI across our time period is 0.202, hence a one standard deviation increase in RTI is associated with a decrease in the likelihood of being employed one year later of 0.53 percentage points (2.6 * 0.202). Given that the mean rate of employment loss over one year amounts to 13 percent, this can be viewed as a small, but substantial, reduc-tion in employment probability due to a worker being exposed to RTI tasks.  Column 2 displays results that extend this to ask whether this RTI penalty has changed over the sample period. It reports coefficients on RTI and RTI interacted with a time trend. Whilst caution must be taken with adding interac-tion and main effects in a non-linear model, the signs and relative magnitude of these terms are informative. The initial RTI effect, which can be interpreted as the effect of RTI on employment stability at the start of our period, is essentially zero. RTI exposure was unrelated to employment stability in the late 1970s. The interaction term sug-gests that this changed over the past decades. Interpreting interaction terms in non-linear models is difficult. To provide a rough guide, we re-estimated this model using a linear probability model. The estimates suggest that a worker who was in an entirely routine job (i.e. RTI intensity = 100 per cent) would face an annual decrease in one year employment stability of 1.5 percentage points when compared to a worker who performed no routine tasks. Again, recognizing that this is an unrealistic comparison we rescale this effect by the standard deviation of RTI across our period of analysis. Doing so suggests that a one standard deviation increase in RTI was associated with a reduction in one-year employment stability of just over 10 percentage points over the past 35 years. This, we believe, is a quite dramatic reduction in employment stability. Column 3 includes industrial sector and year interaction terms. This is motivated by a concern that occupations are not distributed evenly across industrial sec-tors. Hence, conditional associations between RTI and employment could, at least in part, reflect sector-specific temporal shocks. In practice, this introduction does not markedly affect our estimates. The initial RTI effect moves closer to zero, but the rate of change over the period is essentially unaltered.  Columns 4 to 6 report analogous estimates for employment probability after five years, where again we include sector and year interaction terms. As column 4 shows, the probability of employment probability after 5 years is negatively affected by exposure to RTI. This average effect across the period is of a similar magnitude to that re-ported for employment after one year. Computing the marginal effect shows that workers in completely routine jobs (i.e. RTI=1) have a 6 percentage points lower likelihood of being in employment after five years than workers with completely non-routine jobs. Again we standardize the size of this effect. A one standard deviation increase in the RTI of a job is associated with a 1.2 percentage point reduction in being in employment after five years. Column 5 and 6 report estimates where again we include an interaction between RTI and time. In the case of em-ployment probability after five years, the introduction of industrial sector and time interactions is more consequential than for the employment probability in t+1, i.e. the coefficients of interest change more when com-paring specification 5 and 6 than when comparing specification 2 and 3. This is an indication that controlling for sectoral shocks matters more in the longer run (t+5) than in the short run (t+1). The estimates reported in column 6 suggest that exposure to RTI was, in the late 1970s, associated with greater employment stability over a five year period. However, this changed dramatically over the following 35 years, as evidenced by the interaction term Page 24 | Long-run Patterns of Labour Market Polarisation: Evidence from German Micro Data  between RTI and time. It is furthermore noticeable that the employment penalties associated with RTI exposure are larger for employment probability in t+5 (compare columns 3 and 6).  Again, to aid interpretation, we re-estimated the model from column 6 as a linear probability model. These results suggest that RTI exposure was associated with a reduction of five year employment stability of 1.3 percentage points every year across the period. This, when again scaled by a one standard deviation increase in RTI, means that five year employment stability falls by approximately 9 percenage points across the 35 year period. Taken together, this suggests short term negative effects of RTI exposure on individual\u2019s employment stability that are exacerbated over the longer-term.

The estimates reported in Table 3 reflect conditional effects averaged across all workers. One question that natu-rally arises is the extent to which these effects are likely to be heterogeneous over different worker types. Two main dimensions likely to be particularly important are the age and skill levels of workers. Table 4 reports esti-mates that correspond to the specifications in columns (1) and (2) from Table 3. Hence the first column reports the average effect (across the period) of RTI exposure on employment stability, while the 2nd and 3rd column pro-vide the starting (1979) effect on employment stability such that they provide the effect of RTI at the start of the period and trend effect of RTI on employment stability across the whole period. In terms of average effects, the negative effects on employment stability are concentrated among prime-age workers (26-35), with some indica-tion that the negative effects are greater for medium skill workers. For all age groups RTI exposure decreases employment stability over our period of observation. There is variation in the initial effect of RTI on employment stability by skill levels. Low skill workers, even in 1979, faced lower employment stability if in jobs with high RTI. This RTI effect remains constant for these workers, while for both medium and high skill workers RTI is increas-ingly associated with employment instability over time.

Specifically, task intensity could influence job stability, and/or exit rates out of unemployment. We try to disentan-gle these channels.  Table 5 provides estimates of the probability of exiting from employment to any other employment state (em-ployed or un-employed). In this way, it provides estimates of the effect of RTI exposure on job stability. All estimates are reported as hazard ratios. We follow a similar strategy to the earlier models of employment stability by reporting models with increasingly complex specifications. The first column reports the average effect of RTI on the probability of making an employment transition. This effect is sizeable, again scaling this effect shows that a one percentage point increase in RTI leads to an approximate 0.4% increase (exp(0.34)-1) in the likelihood of exiting your current job. Recalling that the standard deviation of RTI is 0.202, this again is a large effect. Interact-ing this effect with time (column 2 and 3) reveals that this risk of exit is increasing at approximately 0.04 percentage points every year, this represents a non-negligible increase in job instability over our period of analy-sis.

These overall exit rates may hide a mixture of job-to-job transitions and job-to-unemployment transitions. Welfare losses attached to technological change are most likely to be concentrated in the latter transitions. This leads us to re-estimate our duration models where instead the hazard state is exit from employment to unemployment.  These results are reported in Table 6 and reveal more dramatic patterns of the effect of RTI exposure on job sta-bility. RTI exposure is associated with markedly higher risk of subsequent exit to unemployment. A one percentage point higher RTI leads to an increase in the likelihood of entering unemployment of approximately 0.65%. This risk has trended up rapidly across the last 4 decades. This provides evidence that a feature of job polarization has been an increasing risk of experiencing a period of unemployment for workers performing routine tasks.

This leads to an obvious question regarding the ability of these workers to subsequently exit unemployment and how this has changed over time. We estimate hazard models of the likelihood of exiting unemployment to em-ployment where we use the RTI of the last employment spell as the main variable of interest. Insofar as this has any effect on re-employment probabilities this is informative of potential labour market scarring effects of RTI ex-posure. In practice, we find no evidence of this (Table 7). Previously holding an RTI-intensive job is associated, if anything, with a higher likelihood of re-entering employment, and this is trending upwards over time. This sug-gests that the increasing job instability of RTI-intensive work over the period has been coincident with countervailing effects on re-employment probabilities. This has the potential to have mitigated some of the wel-fare losses associated with this job instability and the changes in occupational structure, more generally.

The effects reported in Tables 5 to 7 are averaged across all workers. Again we seek to explore heterogeneity of effect across age groups and skill level. These results are reported in Table 8 grouped by the effect on risk of job exit, risk of job exit to unemployment, and subsequent likelihood (risk) of finding a job for the unemployed. For risk of job exit, and job exit to unemployment there is little evidence of variation by age, although workers in jobs with high RTI aged 26 to 35 appear to face a higher likelihood of job exit to unemployment. The effects on subse-quent job finding are more pronounced, RTI exposure for workers aged 36 and above is associated with an increased subsequent job finding rate. There is no effect for younger workers. Furthermore, we find evidence for strong heterogeneous effects with respect to skills, i.e. routine intensity strongly increases the unemployment exit probability of high-skilled workers. This is not apparent for low-skilled workers.

As a first step, we estimate a number of models where the dependent variable is log real wages and our main right hand side variable of interest is the RTI of the job. These are re-ported in Table A.8. The controls are listed in the table notes, but the coefficients are omitted for the sake of brevity. We pool our sample period and the first two columns report the relationship between current job RTI and wages. The first column provides the average wage effect of RTI across the 1975 to 2014 period, which is 0.378 log points lower. A one standard deviation increase in RTI exposure is associated with an approximate 7.6% wage penalty. The second column includes an interaction between RTI and time, such that the RTI coefficient Page 28 | Long-run Patterns of Labour Market Polarisation: Evidence from German Micro Data  now provides the initial wage penalty. This is -0.259, while the interaction term indicates that the RTI wage pen-alty increased, and quite substantially, over the period. The following 4 columns provide similar results but where instead the relationship under examination is RTI of the current job and wages in the next year, or five years later, respectively.  The estimates for these are very similar to those for the contemporaneous relationship between RTI and wages. Our reading of this is that there are substantial wage penalties that have increased markedly over the past four decades associated with RTI. However, there is no evidence of additional scarring effects on individual\u2019s wages due to past exposure to RTI.  Table A.9. reports RTI exposure effects on wages by age and skill level of workers, respectively. Again, we report contemporaneous effects along with those for one year and five years on, respectively.  There is a clear age gra-dient to the wage penalties. All age groups suffer wage penalties through RTI exposure, however the magnitude of these effects are over 3 times larger for 46 to 65 year old workers when compared to those aged 18-25. Again these effects do not change markedly over one and five year windows. A skill gradient is also apparent. High-skill workers in jobs suffer a very large wage penalty through RTI exposure. There are substantial penalties for me-dium-skill workers, and smaller effects for low-skill workers. The high-skill RTI penalty diminishes by approximately one third over a five-year period, perhaps reflecting the greater ease with which high-skill workers can change job. These penalties are, in contrast, quite stable for low- and medium-skill workers.  Long-run Patterns of Labour Market Polarisation: Evidence from German Micro Data  | Page 29  6 Conclusion  The past four decades have seen dramatic changes in the structure of the labour market. Rapid decreases in computing costs have led to a sharp reduction in the demand for jobs that are intensive in routine tasks. The ex-isting literature highlights the aggregate patterns of labour market polarisation associated with this. We revisit this issue using German administrative data that allows us to address a range of questions currently unanswered in the literature. We present, to our knowledge, the first evidence on changes in task intensity of jobs over a long period and at an annual level. This allows us to examine the trend in polarisation over time which is important as the previous literature has suggested both periods of heightened polarisation and/or accentuated cyclical pat-terns. Our first main finding is to show that neither are the case in Germany. In this context, polarisation represents a steady secular change over the period of 1975 to 2014. Any cyclical patterns are dominated by this process. This is important as it suggests ongoing structural change without episodes of heightened changes in employment task shares. With this as a starting point we seek to understand the worker transitions contributing to these patterns. Again, this is an analysis for which our data is particular well suited and where there is little existing evidence. Our re-sults suggest that exposure to jobs with higher routine-task content is associated with higher risk of being out of employment in both the short term (after one year) and medium term (five years). Subsequent results show that this employment penalty to routineness of work has increased over the past four decades.  The reasons for the employment penalty to routineness of work were then traced back to routine task work being associated with reduced job stability and an associated higher likelihood of making a transition to unemployment and thus experiencing periods of unemployment. By contrast, we find that previous work with high RTI for unem-ployed persons is associated with higher job-finding rates out of unemployment which thus at least partly compensates for the negative effects of RTI on employment stability. Further research is required to understand the extent to which these patterns of labour market transitions for routine workers are associated with individual welfare losses.Page 30 | Long-run Patterns of Labour Market Polarisation: Evidence from German Micro Data  7 References Abbring, J.H. and G.J. van den Berg (2007), The unobserved heterogeneity distribution in duration analysis.

The 2006 and 2012 waves were conducted as \u201cBIBB/BAuA Labour Force Survey\u201d, which were jointly carried out by BIBB and the Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Arbeitsschutz und Ar-beitsmedizin: BAuA). In the cross-section BIBB surveys, workers state which activities they perform at their workplace from a given list. Although the surveys include a rich set of workplace activities, the number and the definition of the surveyed ac-tivities differ across waves. While the 1979 wave covers approximately 90 activities, the number of activities decreased to 19 in the 2012 wave. In order to create a task intensity measure that is consistent over time, we ex-cluded the activities that appeared only in one wave. We merged some of the activities into one variable in order to deal with the changing definitions of the variables and to maintain a total number of activities which is similar in each survey. For example, the activity \u201cbuying, selling, advertising\u201d in the 1985 wave was split into two separate variables as \u201cbuying and selling\u201d and \u201cadvertising\u201d in 1999; we thus merged these two variables to make the com-parison to the previous wave easier.  The answer categories in the surveys were also different across waves. While in some waves the answer cate-gory was binary, in other waves workers were asked whether they performed an activity \u201coften\u201d, \u201csometimes\u201d, or \u201cnever\u201d. In case of three-category answers, we classified the answer categories \u201csometimes\u201d and \u201cnever\u201d together to have a consistent binary variable. We tested the robustness of our results by applying four alternative definitions of task intensity measures to deal with the inconsistencies across waves mentioned above. In the \u201crestricted\u201d approach, we merge even more sur-vey questions compared to the baseline approach in order to keep the number of questions in all three task categories as close to each other as possible. The \u201clenient\u201d definition assumes that an activity is applied when the answer to survey questions is \u201calways\u201d or \u201csometimes\u201d whereas the baseline category uses only the answer cate-gory \u201calways\u201d. \u201cLenient-Restricted\u201d approach applies the lenient definition to the restricted set of merged variables. Finally the \u201cexcluded variables\u201d definition ignores the survey questions which were not repeated in all the waves. The results of these robustness analyses are available from the authors upon request.Long-run Patterns of Labour Market Polarisation: Evidence from German Micro Data  | Page 33  Table A1: List of

Feasibility study, Plant Nursing Robotics, weeding, agriculture, horticulture, capability, \neconomic viability \nIntroduction \nWithin outdoor organic gardening, weeds are today a major problem, especially for crops, like carrots \nand onions. Also, there is an increasing demand from the consumers and the society to reduce the \npesticide use in order to minimize the impact on flora, fauna, aquatic system, and working \nenvironment. The pesticide may be reduced by using precision spraying or the pesticide use may be \neliminated completely by using manual weeding within the rows. The manual weeding may be \ncarried out in an upright working position using a hoe, lying on the knees or positioned on a cart. All \nworking postures will be strenuous, even for a short duration and the work may be characterized as \none-sided and repetitive. Depending on the weed intensity, Danish outdoor gardeners use 50-300 \nhours per hectare for manual weeding in onions and carrots (\u00d8rum and Christensen, 2001; Melander \nand Rasmussen, 2001). This is cost-intensive not only in direct labour costs but also in form of labour \nallocated to this one operation relative to other urgent tasks within the growing season. Further, there \nare often difficulties associated with procuring the necessary labour. \nAutomation of the precision spraying or the manual weeding will eliminate the monotone and \nfatiguing work and replace it with a precise, quality enhancing and flexible machine operation. \nExperiences from the use of auto steering shows that the working conditions of the operator is \nimproved significantly in terms of reduced strain and improved work quality (Keller, 2005). The \nnatural next step will be to make the machine or implement autonomous and release the operator for \nconcurrent tasks like managing the operation. Mobile robots have emerged as automated guided \nvehicles (AGV\u2019s) situated in structured environments. Currently, these types of vehicles are \ndeveloping into autonomous vehicles capable of self-guidance comprising reliable and autonomous \nnavigation in unstructured environments (Garcia-Alegre, 2001). These vehicles are very much suited \nfor replacing tedious and monotonous tasks in industry and agriculture requiring precision, reliability, \ntraceability, etc. Their applicability and superior performance have been proven through extensive \nuse in the industrial setting (e.g. Mortimer, 2004). They have definite cost, quality, workability, and \noutput advantages over manual processes even for processes where labour costs are low because \nof the higher work quality. Overall productivity may be increased even if the proverbial rule of 80/20 \napplies, where only 80% of the task at hand is fully automated (Stentz, 2001).   \n3 \nAs regards relevant weeding robots, worldwide, there exists only a few today. In Denmark, there \nis a prototype GreenTrac, which is designed as an environmentally sensible tool carrier for organic \noutdoor gardeners. The GreenTrac is not matured for production and is unnecessary big for most \ntasks (S\u00f8rensen and Frederiksen, 2002). In Sweden, there is a robot for intra row weeding in sugar \nbeets (\u00c5strand and Baerveldt, 2002). Israel has a multi-functional prototype robot for transplanting \nand spraying (Edan and Bechar, 1998). In England, an outdoor gardening robot has been developed \nwhich is capable of passing over parcels of row crops (e.g. Hague, 1997), but it has difficulties \nperforming real field work. At the latest, Aarhus University, Department of Agricultural Engineering, \nand Vitus Bering, Denmark, have been involved in developing an automatic tool carrier, \n(www.Hortibot.com) based on an existing commercial machine (J\u00f8rgensen et al., 2006a; J\u00f8rgensen \net al., 2006b).    \nThe paper presents the feasibility of using the Hortibot to carry weeding tools within organic grown \nonions. The potential economic effects of changes in the use of technology for row crop weeding \nwere assessed by using the principles of a partial budget approach (Landers, 2000). The focus was \non demonstrating the difference in operating costs between the dedicated innovative technology and \nthe conventional system. \nThree accompanying papers were presented at ASABE2006, part I to III, covering the following \nproject related subjects: I - Solutions chosen for the HortiBot with regard to hardware mechanical-\nelectrical interfaces and software; II - Application of Quality Function Deployment (QFD) Method for \nHorticultural Robotic Tool Carrier Design Planning; III - HortiBot: Comparison of potential present and \nfuture phytotechnologies for weed control.  \nMethodology \nIn order to assess the operational and economic viability of a robotic weeding system, a usage \nscenario for a typical horticultural weeding operation was set up. This scenario was then analyzed \nand evaluated using dedicated evaluation methods. The usage scenario was analysed in terms of \noperations performance and operating costs. The costs and potential benefits of using autonomous \nvehicles were compared with conventional operations and the supplemented management practices. \nUsage scenario \nThe devised scenario is for organic cultivated bulb onion (Allium cepa L.) and shallots (Allium cepa L. \nvar. aggregatum G. Don). The used onion seeds, accepted by regulatory authorities for organic \nonion production, have an expected germination rate of 75%.  \nSeeding are done on 2 m wide beds made up of loosened soil, and seeded in 5 parallel rows per bed \nwith 35 cm row spacing and 3 cm seed spacing within the row. The cultivation and seeding \nprocedures are recommended by the Danish Agricultural Advisory services for organic grown onion \n(\u00d8rum & Christensen, 2001). The headlands are not cultivated, and the positions of obstacles are \nknown and clearly marked in the field according to prerequisites set by the HortiBot operation manual \n(J\u00f8rgensen et al., 2006). As regards the expected weed population in the horticultural field, it \nconsists of commonly appearing species of monocotyledons and dicotyledons of annual, perennial \nweeds and perennial weeds with vegetative reproduction.   \nSelection of tool carrier technology \n \nBy modifying a remote controlled slope mower it has been shown that it is possible to produce a \nrobust horticultural tool carrier called Hortibot (J\u00f8rgensen et al., 2006a; J\u00f8rgensen et al., 2006b) \u2013 \nsee Figure 1.   \n4 \nThe HortiBot is capable of passing over several parcels with visible rows autonomously based on a \nnew commercial row detection system from Agrocom Vision (former Eco-Dan Inc., Denmark) with \nminimum use of Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Other functionalities include that unskilled \nworkers will be able to operate the basic functions of the HortiBot with a minimum of training and by \nusing a pictogram as an operational guide. Traceability in the Hortibot will be available online and in \nreal time by transmitting all operational data to an internet based database. \nIt was shown that the most important user requirements attained to a robotic weeding tool carrier \ninclude easy adaptation of the carrier to field conditions in terms or row distance and parcel size \n(S\u00f8rensen et al., 2006). Currently, the Hortibot does not fulfill these demands entirely, but the \nmodular construction makes it relatively simple to adapt to these requirements. Furthermore, a \nproject named Omnirota at the Aarhus University, Denmark, will fully develop and mature a basic \nwheel module targeted at a flexible and High-Tec robot platform adapted to operations in agriculture \nand horticulture. Such a module, which can be implemented across robot platforms will rationalize \nand considerably advance the development of the robot platforms themselves.  \n   \nFigure 1. Hortibot design with individual wheel control, 3D row vision system (a), and lift arms (b) \n \nSelection of physical weeding technology and strategy \nIn this scenario, flame weeding is not considered because of some significant weed controlling and \npractical drawbacks. Firstly, weeds have to be at earlier growth stages than the crop (Bond and \nGrundy, 2001), and secondly, the most frequently occurring weeds, pineapple-weed (Chamomille \nsuav\u00e9olens), is tolerant to thermal treatment (Netland et al., 1994). Nemming (1993), Holm\u00f8y and \nNetland (1994) and Netland et al. (1994) reported that flame weeding at the time of  post emergence \nof onions provides a large variation in weed density reduction (i.e. between 40 and 90%) without \naffecting crop yield, and where the selectivity depends on the dose (kg gas ha\n-1). Unlike mechanical \nmethods of weed control, there is no soil disturbance to stimulate a further flush of seedling \nemergence. In addition, flame weeders have the advantage of being usable when the soil is too wet \nfor mechanical weeders. Nevertheless, flame weeding is not considered for robotic weeding mainly \ndue to safety and auxiliary reasons, meaning that more supervision is required for flame weeding \nthan for mechanical weeding. \nInstead, the selected strategy was to use a standard and 2 m wide weed harrow mounted on the \nHortiBot for weeding 0 to 3 weeks before seeding which should be approximately 1 week after bed \nridging (the HortiBot navigate on the basis of computer vision recognition of the topography of the \ntracks between beds). The weed harrowing procedure is repeated 1 to 3 weeks after seeding. The \nforward velocity for weed harrowing is 1.5 m/s. \na)\nb) \nb)  \n5 \nThe implement tools for inter and intra-row weeding consists of standard A-shaped hoes for inter-row \nweeding, and with bed ridgers attached to each end of the implement tool bar. The intra-row weeding \nwill be provided by finger and torsion weeders and pneumatic nozzles (Bernaerts, 2004; L\u00fctkemeyer, \n2000), all attached to five individual units carrying the A-shaped hoes. The pneumatics operates at 4-\n8 bar and output 2 m\n3 compressed air, and distributed on 10 nozzles (2 per row) placed 2-3 cm \nbelow soil surface and blowing on weeds in order to up-root or damage them. The pneumatic \nnozzles are switched on and off by electronically controlled pneumatic valves. This feature has not \nbeen researched yet, but the technology is simple and hence, it is selected for this scenario and \noccupying a forward velocity of 0.5 m/s. Both the navigation control parallel to the rows and with-in \nrows are based on computer vision recognition and furthermore, the positioning of individual onion \nplants are based on principles described in \u00c5strand et al (2005), as this method is not restricted to a \nspecific crop. \u00c5strand et al. (2005) showed that context based recognition of sugar beets (Beta \nvulgaris L.) at the 2-leaf stage obtained an individual crop recognition rate of 96%. Thus, a crop loss \nof 4% is expected but only for the first treatment, as the method gets more reliable when weeds are \nat earlier growth stages than the crop. Since seeded onions do not have 100% field emergence, \n\u00c5strand et al. (2005) also defined that about 30% weed seedlings in the row will be recognized as \nonion at crop field emergence rate of 70%, and stated that the higher crop emergence, the less \nweeds recognized as crop plants. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2. Selected weeding tool (www.mechanischschoon.nl) \nBy utilizing more advanced computer vision navigation, a row band width of 5 cm is considered for \nthe boundary between inter and intra-row weeding area (2.5 cm on each side of the row center \ndefined by plant positions). Thus, in this scenario it is expected that 87.5% of the total area are \ncovered with the inter-row area and the inter-row weeding, leaving 12.5% for the intra-row area for \nintra-row weeding. A strategy consisting of 6 to 8 post-emergence treatments with 1 to 2 weeks apart \nare considered as recommended by Graglia et al. (2004, 2006). A 60-95% weed control is expected \nfor the intra-row area (Bernaerts, 2004, www.mechanischschoon.nl) and 62-90% weed control (all \nspecies) is expected for the inter-row area (Graglia et al., 2004, Pullen and Cowell, 1997). \nThe conventional strategy is selected according to the newly published manual for practical weed \ncontrol (van der Schans and Bleeker, 2006), which implies weed harrowing with e.g. a 5 bed wide \ntine harrow (i.e. 10 m) 0 to 3 weeks before seeding which should be approximately 1 week after bed \nridging. The weed harrowing procedure is repeated 1 to 3 weeks after seeding. Post-emergence \ntreatment will consist of a combined 3 bed treatment with A-shaped sweeps, finger and torsion \nweeders. Three treatments, 1 to 2 weeks apart are performed. Commercial available computer vision \nsystems will be used for navigation at 2 m/s operation velocity, leaving the row band border at +/- 5 \ncm from the row center (i.e. row band width = 10 cm). Surviving weeds in the intra-row area are hand \nweeded once after all three tractor operated operations are carried out. An overall weed control of \n95% is expected with the conventional strategy. \n  \n6 \nOperations modelling \nThe performance estimate for the autonomous weeding unit and the conventional system was \nmodeled using a framework of specific task models (Nielsen & S\u00f8rensen, 1993; S\u00f8rensen et al., \n2003). According to this framework, labour and machine input was estimated as a function of \nparameters, such as field dimensions, working speed, working width, etc.: \n1\n) 1 (\n600\n/ 60\n\u2212 \u00d7 \u239f \u239f\n\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c \u239c\n\u239d\n\u239b\n\u00d7 + +\n+ \u00d7\n\u00d7 \u00d7\n+\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n= h h s k\na e\nn b p\ne v\nh\nA    (1) \nwhere: A is the realised capacity in ha h\n-1; h is the size of the field in ha; v is the working speed in km \nh\n\u20131; e is the effective working width in m; p is the time for turning in min per turning; b is the field \nwidth in m; n is the number of turnings per pass (normally n=2); a is a model parameter dependent \non field shape and travel pattern (a=1 in the case of driving back and forth in the rows); k is the \nturnings on headland in min per field; and s represented the stochastic crop and soil stops, \nadjustments, control, tending of machine in min ha\n\u20131.  \nThe field efficiency factor depicts the realized capacity to the theoretical capacity. In terms of \nEquation (1), the field efficiency, E, is estimated as: \nA\nh\ne v\nE /\n10\u00d7\n\u00d7\n=      (2) \nTypical values for field operations vary from 55 to 90% with typical values for weeding operations \nranging from 70 to 90% (ASAE, 2003).  \nOperating costs \nThe direct costs of operating new technologies were calculated by using conventional methods for \nestimating depreciation, interest and maintenance of machinery (S\u00f8rensen et al, 2005). The costs \nwere distributed over a predetermined lifetime as well as over the number of hectares being treated \nby the machinery. The machinery costs included interest and depreciation, maintenance, fuel \nconsumption and necessary manual labour input.  \nMaintenance and repair costs per hour included costs for both materials and labour, and were based \non normative data for maintenance costs derived as a fraction of the initial investment and depending \non the yearly use of the machine (Laursen, 1993). In this way, the variation as a function of \nmachinery size was reduced. This procedure was used for both implements and tractive machinery. \nThe average fuel requirement per hour was estimated as a function of machinery size. In order to \nassure equal assumptions across the systems, the average engine load for all machinery systems \nwas set to the same fraction of the maximum power. The average fuel consumption was estimated \nas: \n    \nd\nf P x\nl\ne m\n\u00d7\n\u00d7 \u00d7\n=\n1000\n    (3)   \nwhere: l was the average fuel consumption in l h\n\u22121; x was the engine load; pm was the maximum \npower of the tractor in kW,  fe was the assumed fuel efficiency in g kWh\n-1, and d was the density in kg \nl\n-1 \nThe annual costs of interest and depreciation were estimated as an annuity distributed over the \neconomic life of the machine. The economic life was dependent on the annual utilization of the \nmachine, such that more operating hours had a faster depreciation rate. In addition, a maximum \neconomic life span was estimated for each machine as a limit not to be exceeded even if the annual  \n7 \nutilization of the machine was low. A general scrap value of 10% was anticipated, indicating that the \nused machines were saleable (Laursen, 1993). The interest rate was set to 5% as representing a \ncurrent average rate. \nLabour costs were based on contractually fixed hourly wages (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2003), and the \nnumber of operating hours was based on the labour requirement estimations. \nThe average annual total costs were determined using Eqn (4) as a combination of capital costs and \nvariable costs: \n   ) (\n) 1 ( 1\n) ) 1 /( (\n) ( t w m o\nr\nr r S I I\nC\nn\nn\nn + + \u00d7 +\n+ \u2212\n\u00d7 + \u00d7 \u2212\n=\n\u2212   (4) \nwhere: C was the total annual costs in $ year\n-1; I was the initial machinery investment  in $; Sn was \nthe scrap value after n years in decimal; n was the number of years over which the machine was \ndepreciated; r was the interest rate in decimal; o was the required operating hours; m was the \nmaintenance costs in $ h\n-1; w was the labour costs in $ h\n-1; and t was the tractor costs in $ h\n-1; The \nnumber of operating hours was estimated as a function of the acreage and the machine capacity. \nResults \nOperational parameters \n \nThe model parameters are based on preliminary test data and expert assessments.

The workable time per day for the conventional \nsystem is constrained within normal working hours for the operator \n&) The potential number of days suitable for hoeing and weeding was estimated yearly over the 30-year period \nof 1961\u201390 using recorded weather data together with the weather constraints determining the number of \nworkable days or hours  derived from reported conditions for soil tillage in Denmark (S\u00f8rensen, 2003).   \n10 \nThe model comparison shows a cost reduction of 35% by using the robotic weeding system with the \ndenoted prerequisites, like 90% weeding efficiency as an expression for the work quality. Preliminary \nsensitivity analyses indicate that a 75% weeding efficiency will reduce the profitability by 26%.  \nOther important factors influencing the profitability of the robotic weeding system include the initial \ninvestment and operational costs like maintenance costs. By reducing the initial investment by 25% \nthe profitability of the robotic weeding system is improved by 13%. In the basis scenario, the \nmaintenance costs for the robotic system is estimated using norm data for a conventional combine \nharvester as illustrative of a comparatively complex machine. In the case of using maintenance norm \ndata for tractors, the profitability will increase 28%. Further sensitivity analyses are required to \nprecisely identify the most significant factors in terms of influencing the profitability of the robotic \nsystems as compared with the conventional system.      \n \nConclusion \nThe study shows that autonomous inter-row and intra-row weeding systems have the potential \nbecoming more economically viable when compared to conventional tractor operated weeding \nsystems combined with manual weeding. Important determining parameters for the profitability of the \nautonomous system are the work quality in terms of weeding efficiency, initial investment, and \noperational costs like maintenance costs.  \nReferences \nAgrimach 2004.

The current study investigated the effects of an Executive Functioning (EF) \ntraining with game-elements on weight loss maintenance in obese children, over and above \nthe care as usual in an inpatient treatment program. Forty-four children (aged 8-14 years) who \nwere in the final months of a 10-months inpatient treatment program in a medical paediatric \ncentre were randomized to either the 6 week EF-training condition or to a care as usual only \ncontrol group. The EF-training consisted of a 25-session training of inhibition and working \nmemory. Treatment outcomes were child performances on cognitive tasks of inhibition and \nworking memory and childcare worker ratings on EF-symptoms as well as weight loss \nmaintenance after leaving the clinic. Children in the EF-training condition showed \nsignificantly more improvement than the children in the care as usual only group on the \nworking memory task as well as on the childcare worker reports of working memory and \nmeta-cognition. They were also more capable to maintain their weight loss until 8 weeks post-\ntraining. This study shows promising evidence for the efficacy of an EF-training as weight \nstabilization intervention in obese children. \n \nKeywords: obesity, childhood, executive functioning, working memory, inhibition, cognitive \ntraining \n \n \n 2\n 63 \n64 \n65 \n66 \n67 \n68 \n69 \n70 \n71 \n72 \n73 \n74 \n75 \n76 \n77 \n78 \n79 \n80 \n81 \n82 \n83 \n84 \n85 \n86 \n87 \nThe dramatic rise in childhood obesity in recent decades is well established (Ogden, \nCarrol, Curtin, Lamb, & Flegal, 2010). The major health problems and psychosocial \nconsequences associated with this rise make the development of an effective treatment for \nobese children imperative. Multidimensional treatment programmes including diet, exercise \nand behaviour change have demonstrated their efficacy, showing positive outcomes in the \nshort term as well as some evidence of long term maintenance of treatment effect (Luttikhuis \net al.,  2009). However, with severely obese children these interventions suffer from high \ndrop-out rates or result in significant weight regain at follow-up (Levine, Ringham, \nKalarchian, Wisniewski, & Marcus,  2001; Braet, Tanghe, Decaluw\u00e9, Moens, & Rosseel, 2004; \nGoossens, Braet, Van Vlierberghe, & Mels, 2009). More effective tailoring of treatment to \nunderlying core deficits involved in obesity may be one promising approach for enhancing \nlong-term weight maintenance.  \nRecent investigations suggest that weight gain results, at least in part, from the \ninability to resist temptations and inhibit automatic responses (Smith, Hay, Campbell, & \nTrollor, 2011).  Impressive longitudinal research has shown that children between two and \nfive years old with limited impulse control are more likely to be above average weight at the \nage of 5, 11 or 12 (Francis, & Susman, 2009; Graziano, Calkins, & Keane, 2010; Seeyave et \nal., 2009). Cross-sectional studies have found that overweight children act more on impulse \nthan children of normal weight (Braet, Claus, Verbeken, & Van Vlierberghe, 2007; \nNederkoorn, Braet, Van Eijs, Tanghe, & Jansen, 2006) and one prospective study has shown \nthat impulsivity hinders weight loss in therapy (Nederkoorn, Jansen, Mulkens, & Jansen, \n2007).  \nExecutive function deficits have often been proposed as underlying core deficits in \nimpulse control (Barkley, 1997). Executive Functions (EFs) allow individuals to regulate their \n 3\nbehaviour, thoughts and emotions, and thereby enable self-control. Weight-loss and weight-\nloss maintenance clearly require executive functioning. First, cognitive control such as the \ninhibition of automatic responses and approach behaviour is highly indicated when, for \nexample, a child needs to resist palatable snacks. Second, adequate memory capacity \n(\u2018remembering what I was doing or what I have to do to reach a current goal\u2019) is also seen as \na necessary self-regulation ability. It is assumed that enhanced working memory may \nfacilitate planning, monitoring, and self-instruction, which, in turn, can improve impulse \ncontrol in eating behavior and consequently can help in weight management. Today, there is \nalready some evidence that working memory is necessary for learning new skills and that \nsufficient working memory capacity is required to be able to transfer the new skills to a long-\nterm behavioral repertoire (Bickel, Jarmolowicz, Mueller, Gatchalian, & McClure, 2012). \nEvidence in children with cognitive control deficits  suggest that in general it may be that \nvisuo-spatial working memory is more related to impulsivity/self-regulation than verbal \nworking memory (e.g. Martinussen, Hayden, Hogg-Johnson, & Tannock, 2005). Moreover, \nthe two EFs are related since the cognitive capacity to inhibit automatic responses and forego \ntemptations is limited and depends upon the deployment of sufficient working memory \ncapacity (Hofmann, Gschwender, Friese, Wiers, & Smitt, 2008). \n88 \n89 \n90 \n91 \n92 \n93 \n94 \n95 \n96 \n97 \n98 \n99 \n100 \n101 \n102 \n103 \n104 \n105 \n106 \n107 \n108 \n109 \n110 \n111 \n112 \nAdvances in neuro-imaging research suggest that impairment in cognitive inhibition \nmay indeed lead to a failure in deactivating food reward circuits and consequently facilitate \novereating (Wang, Volkow, Thanos, & Fowler, 2009), resulting in a higher body mass index \n(BMI) (Volkow et al., 2009; Batterink, Yokum, & Stice, 2010). Conversely, higher prefrontal \ncortex (PFC) activation has been shown to be associated with dietary restraint (DelParigi et \nal., 2007) and lower BMI (Batterink et al., 2010). Similarly, behavioural studies in obese \nchildren suggest that they have problems with behavioural inhibition, as assessed with a well-\nvalidated computerized measure (Stop-signal Task; e.g. Nederkoorn et al., 2006; Verbeken, \n 4\nBraet, Claus, Nederkoorn, & Oosterlaan, 2009). Additionally, the association between weight \ncontrol and working memory has been clearly shown in a study by Li, Dai, Jackson, and \nZhang (2008) that included over 2000 children and an impressive number of covariates. This \nstudy found that compared to children of average weight, obese children performed \nsignificantly poorly on a visual spatial working memory test.   \n113 \n114 \n115 \n116 \n117 \n118 \n119 \n120 \n121 \n122 \n123 \n124 \n125 \n126 \n127 \n128 \n129 \n130 \n131 \n132 \n133 \n134 \n135 \n136 \n137 \nToday, treatment programmes for severely obese children already focus on improving \nimpulse control by means of learning self-regulation skills such as self-observation, self-\ninstruction, self-evaluation and self-reward (Duffy & Spence, 1993; Braet et al., 2004). \nNevertheless, for some obese children, these vital skills seem hard to implement in daily life \nand are not very effective in the long term as children often relapse. It seems likely that, as \nlong as children do not strengthen their EF, the acquired impulse self-control skills remain of \nlimited capacity. In this context, studies on how to modify the supposed underlying core \nneurocognitive processes of poor impulse control could be helpful for achieving sustained \nweight loss. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to evaluate an intensive cognitive \ntraining programme for obese children developed specifically to strengthen their EF.  \nConvincing evidence has been found for the trainability of executive functions in \nsamples of children characterized by poor executive functioning such as ADHD samples \n(Klingberg et al., 2005; Klingberg, Forssberg, & Westerberg, 2002; Van der Oord, Ponsioen, \nGeurts, Ten Brink, & Prins, in press) and samples of children with low working memory (but \nno ADHD) (Holmes, Gahercole, & Dunning, 2009; Thorell, Lindqvist, Nutley, Bohlin, & \nKlingberg, 2009). For example, Klingberg and colleagues (2005) showed that in a sample of \nchildren with ADHD, individually adaptable computerized working memory training not only \nimproved the trained working memory; training effects also generalized to other non-trained \nexecutive functions such as response inhibition and complex reasoning. Further, not only did \nthe core EFs improve but also objective behaviour; as there was a significant reduction of \n 5\nparent-rated inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms and positive effects were \nmaintained at three months follow-up. In another study with low working memory samples \nusing the same training, not only did working memory performance improve but also relevant \nand objective school results, including performance in maths at 6 month\u2019s follow-up (Holmes \net al., 2009), again suggesting the generalisability of results to objective behaviour.  \n138 \n139 \n140 \n141 \n142 \n143 \n144 \n145 \n146 \n147 \n148 \n149 \n150 \n151 \n152 \n153 \n154 \n155 \n156 \n157 \n158 \n159 \n160 \n161 \n162 \nFewer studies have been conducted on the trainability of inhibition through cognitive \ntraining. Preschool children trained in inhibition showed a significant improvement on most \nof the trained tasks, but there was no generalization effect of this training to tasks measuring \nother executive functions like working memory (Thorell et al., 2009; White & Shah, 2006). \nThis may have been due to the training task used, in which the level of inhibition was not \nadapted to the level of the child. An individually adaptable task is deemed crucial for \nimproving executive functioning through training (Klingberg, 2010). Recently, Dovis and \ncolleagues (2008b) have developed a format that enables individual differentiation in task \ndifficulty in an inhibitory control task (see method section) by individually adapting the \nwindow of responding for each child.  \n\u00a0 Training of EF is time-consuming and needs prolonged concentration. Adding game \nelements to a potentially boring task may enhance the intrinsic motivation because their \naddition makes the task more interesting and engaging (Dovis, Van der Oord, Wiers, & Prins, \n2011).Moreover, also extrinsic reinforcement contingencies have a positive impact on the task \nperformance and motivation of all children, but this is more pronounced in children with \ndisturbed sensitivity to rewards (Dovis et al., 2011; Haenlein & Caul, 1987; Luman, \nOosterlaan, & Sergeant, 2005). Disturbed sensitivity to rewards is also found in children with \nobesity. Research showed that compared to average weight, obese children exhibit a hyper-\nresponsivity to reward (Stice, Yokum, Burger, Epstein, & Small, 2011; Van den Berg et al., \n2011; Verbeken, Braet, Lammertyn, Moens, & Goossens, 2012) and prefer immediate over \n 6\ndelayed gratification (Verbeken, Braet, & Lammertyn, in prep). A feature that may increase \nchildren\u2019s motivation is adding computer game-elements to tasks. This was already suggested \nin children with ADHD. Parents, teachers and clinicians have reported that children with \nADHD, when playing a computer game, can sustain attention, concentrate for longer periods \nof time and behave less impulsively (Barkley, 2006). Studies also show enhanced cognitive \nperformance on EF-tasks when gaming elements are added to these tasks (Dovis et al., 2011; \nPrins, Dovis, Ponsioen, Ten Brink & Van der Oord, 2011). In the current study, we use \nexecutive functioning training to which game-elements are added, in order to optimize \nchildren\u2019s motivational state and potentially optimize their cognitive performance during \ntraining. \n163 \n164 \n165 \n166 \n167 \n168 \n169 \n170 \n171 \n172 \n173 \n174 \n175 \n176 \n177 \n178 \n179 \n180 \n181 \n182 \n183 \n184 \n185 \n186 \n187 \n In sum, current treatments for childhood obesity are not always effective, and do not \ntarget possible core deficits of executive functioning. In other samples characterized by \nexecutive functioning deficits, EF-training has been shown to be effective. Therefore, the \npurpose of this treatment study is to evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of a 6 week \nintensive cognitive EF-training programme for obese children embedded in a game-world \nabove the effects of an intensive 10-month inpatient treatment programme. Obese children in \nthe final months of the inpatient treatment programme were randomized to either the EF-\ntraining condition or the care-as-usual-only (CAU) condition. The training aimed to improve \nworking memory capacity and response inhibition by directly training both core cognitive \nprocesses. Outcomes were child performances on cognitive EF-tasks and childcare worker \nratings on different cognitive components of executive functioning as well as weight loss \nmaintenance after leaving the clinic. Since this is to our knowledge the first study of the \neffects of EF- training in obese children, hypotheses were mainly exploratory. We expected \nmore improvement in EF in children who were randomized to the EF- training condition than \nthose randomized to the CAU control condition. After the end of the inpatient treatment \n 7\nprogramme, confrontation with the daily food environment at home enabled the study of long-\nterm effects of treatment in the natural environment characterized by a high risk of relapse. \nWe expected better weight loss maintenance at 8 and 12 weeks after leaving the clinic in \nthose randomized to the EF-training condition than in those in the CAU condition.  \n188 \n189 \n190 \n191 \n192 \n193 \n194 \n195 \n196 \n197 \n198 \n199 \n200 \n201 \n202 \n203 \n204 \n205 \n206 \n207 \n208 \n209 \n210 \n211 \n212 \nMethod \nParticipants \nAll overweight children in the final phase of a 10-month inpatient treatment program \nin a medical paediatric centre (Belgium) were invited to participate. Inclusion criteria for \nparticipation in the study were: primary obesity determined by a medical doctor of the clinic,  \nage between 9 and 14 years, an IQ within the normal range as established with the Raven \nProgressive Matrices (RPM; Raven, 1938), and absence of pervasive development disorders \nas determined by a child psychiatrist of the clinic.  Fifty children and their parents received an \ninformation letter about the research project (see Figure 1). Two children were too young \n(seven years old). The remaining 48 children were invited to attend an information session \nand were asked to participate.  Parents of 44 children gave their written informed consent (age \nM=9.79, SD=1.04; boys: 50%) \nDescription of interventions \n  Inpatient treatment as usual. All children were morbid obese at entrance, with a \nminimum of 60 % overweight. The inpatient treatment consisted of a 10-month non-diet \nhealthy lifestyle program. The aim was achieving a healthy body weight through learning the \nchildren to make healthy food choices at fixed times during the day, and providing daily \nphysical activities. Cognitive Behavioral Techniques (CBT) are integrated as part of the \nprogram. The program is described and evaluated in detail in Braet, et al. (2004) and consists \nof three phases of approximately 3 months each: introduction phase, maintenance phase and \ntermination phase. Results show that treated children lost a significant amount of overweight \n 8\n(with a mean loss of 50%) over the 10-month period, whereas their non-treated case-controls \ncontinued to gain weight (Braet, Tanghe, De Bode, Franckx, & Van Winckel, 2003). Results \nshow that, in the last phase, when children were prepared for \u2018returning home\u2019 (termination \nphase), a mean of 10% additional weight loss is achieved and at discharge overweight is \nreduced to 20%-30 %. However, follow-up data showed that after leaving the clinic, children \nregain some of their overweight and at the 14-month follow-up, the children have about \n44.1% overweight (Braet et al., 2004). At the 6 year follow-up overweight returned in to 53% \n(Goossens, Braet, Verbeken, Decaluwe, & Bosmans, 2011). \n213 \n214 \n215 \n216 \n217 \n218 \n219 \n220 \n221 \n222 \n223 \n224 \n225 \n226 \n227 \n228 \n229 \n230 \n231 \n232 \n233 \n234 \n235 \n236 \n237 \nExecutive function training. The intervention is a training of cognitive EF, embedded \nin a game-world (Prins, et al., 2011; Van der Oord et al., submitted). The game is called \n\u2018Braingame Brian\u2019, named after the main character of the game \u201cBrian\u201d. The game consists of \n25 training sessions of about 40 minutes. Each session contains two blocks (of about 20 \nminutes) of two training tasks in a fixed order. The first training task is a working memory \ntraining task, and the second an inhibition training task. Over a period of 6 weeks, the child \ntrains about 4 times a week on fixed days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday). Each \nday, the child does not play more than one session of 40 minutes. After each block of training \ntasks, the difficulty level of the training task is adjusted to the child\u2019s level of performance. \nTo enhance motivation, each completed block of training tasks results in an elaboration of the \ngame-world or extra powers for the main character, Brian. Before, after and in between the \ntraining tasks the child can walk around in the elaborated game-world. With his extra powers \nBrian can create inventions, to help people in his village, resulting in happier village-people \n(the more Brian helps them the more they smile). Thus, completing sessions does not only \nresult in a more elaborated game world, more powers for Brain, but also in happier people in \nthe village. The child plays the computer-game in the clinic after school hours. Every session \na research assistant watches the child play and answers possible questions about the game. \n 9\nFurther, the child keeps a diary of his/her experiences with the game and receives a daily \ntoken for playing the 40-minutes session. \n238 \n239 \n240 \n241 \n242 \n243 \n244 \n245 \n246 \n247 \n248 \n249 \n250 \n251 \n252 \n253 \n254 \n255 \n256 \n257 \n258 \n259 \n260 \n261 \n262 \nThe Working Memory Training. The working memory training, embedded in the game world, \ncombines different types of working memory tasks (Dovis et al., 2008a). It consists of five \nlevels: (1) short term memory, (2) short term memory, updating and keeping information \nonline, (3) short term memory and manipulation/updating, (4) short term memory and keeping \ninformation online during a delay and finally (5) short term memory + keeping information \nonline + manipulation of information/ updating. In each level, the training consists of a 4 x 4 \ngrid of equally sized rectangles (Figure 1). The rectangles light up in a random sequence. The \nrectangles light up for 900 ms, and after 500 ms the next rectangle lights up. After each \nsequence of rectangles the child has to reproduce the sequence by clicking the right rectangles \nin the right order with the computer mouse. The child finishes a session if it has reproduced \n110 correct rectangles. Sequence length is adapted during the training to the level of the \nchild\u2019s performance. \nThe Inhibition Training. This task was designed to train prepotent response inhibition (Dovis \net al., 2008b). The task was visually designed as a factory, in which the child had to respond \nas quick and accurately as possible to an arrow on a machine.  In the first block of trials, a \nstimulus lights up on the left or right side of the computer screen (Figure 2). If the stimulus \nlights up on the left, the child has to press the left button (Q key), and if the stimulus lights up \non the right, the child has to press the right button (P key). It is not a matter of responding as \nquick as possible, but to respond within a certain range; a stimulus at the top of the screen \nshows the range within which the child has to respond (a bar which is colored green between \n700 and 1000 ms and red before 700 ms and after 1000 ms). These are go trials. In the next \nblock the stop trials are introduced: 25% of the trials are stop trials and 75% are go trials. In \nthe stop trials, after presentation of the stimulus a stop-signal is given (a tone and the stimulus \n 10\nturns red). The child has to inhibit his or her ongoing response. The time a child needs to stop \nhis/her response is the stop signal reaction time (SSRT); in the present training the SSRT time \nis progressively shortened; the presentation of the stop signal is adjusted to the individual \nlevel of the child. A block has to be re-played if the child has 20% errors on the go trials and \nmore than 30% errors on the stop trials.  \n263 \n264 \n265 \n266 \n267 \n268 \n269 \n270 \n271 \n272 \n273 \n274 \n275 \n276 \n277 \n278 \n279 \n280 \n281 \n282 \n283 \n284 \n285 \n286 \n287 \nSelection measures \nBody weight. The Body Mass Index (BMI) (weight/height\u00b2) was determined for each \nchild pre-training, post-training, and at 8 weeks and 12 weeks follow up. In order to make \nBMI comparisons between children of different ages, this study uses the adjusted BMI  \n(actual BMI/ Percentile 50 of BMI for age and gender) x 100). The 50th percentiles of the \nBMI for age and gender are based on normative data (Fredriks, van Buuren, Wit, & Verloove-\nVanhorick, 2002).  An adjusted BMI score equal to or greater than 120% is considered as \noverweight (Van Winckel, & Van Mil, 2001).  \nEstimated IQ. The estimated IQ was based on the Raven Progressive Matrices (RPM, \n1938), a widely used test of nonverbal reasoning ability. This is a multiple-choice paper and \npencil test, which consists of a series of visual pattern matching. There are 60 items and these \nare grouped into five series of 12 items (A\u2013E) (Raven & Court, 1998). The validity of the \nRPM is comparable with conventional tests. Various studies conducted among children and \nadolescents showed good to excellent correlation, ranging from .70 to .98, to conventional \ntests of intelligence such as the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (Barratt, 1956). \n \nOutcome measures \n\u00a0 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning [BRIEF] (Goia, Isquith, Guy, & \nKenworth, 2000). Childcare workers of the clinic filled in a Dutch teacher-rated version of the \nBRIEF (Smidts, & Huizinga, 2009), here used as outcome measure. The 75-item BRIEF \n 11\nassesses cognitive components of executive functions and contains 8 subscales: inhibit, shift, \nemotional control, initiate, working memory, plan/organize, organization of materials and \nmonitor. The first three scales form the \u201cbehavior regulation factor\u201d and the remaining five \nthe \u201cmeta-cognition index\u201d. Also, a total score is computed. Higher scores indicate more \nimpaired executive functioning. The BRIEF differentiates between different psychiatric \ndisorders (Gioia, Isquith, Kenworthy, & Barton, 2002) and internal consistency and test-retest \nreliability are good (Smidts, & Huizinga, 2009). For this study, we used the subscales \ninhibition, working memory, the meta-cognition index and the total scale as dependent \nvariables. \n288 \n289 \n290 \n291 \n292 \n293 \n294 \n295 \n296 \n297 \n298 \n299 \n300 \n301 \n302 \n303 \n304 \n305 \n306 \n307 \n308 \n309 \n310 \n311 \n312 \n \n The Corsi Block-Tapping Task - forward and backward version (Corsi, 1972; Milner, \n1971) is a nonverbal paradigm used to assess visuo-spatial working memory. This task has \nwidely been adopted in neurpsychological research (De Renzi & Nichelli, 1975; Kessels, van \nZandvoort, Postma, Kappelle, & de Haan, 2000), and has been claimed to be a valid measure \nof the visuo-spatial sketchpad (Milner, 1971). The task consists of nine cubes that are \npositioned on a square board. The blocks are labeled with numbers, one through nine, that are \nonly visible to the experimenter. The experimenter taps a sequence of blocks (starting with a \nsequence of 3 blocks), after which the participant has to repeat this in the same order (forward \nversion) or in the reversed order (backward version). The same sequence length is presented \nthree times, if the participant produces at least one of the three sequences correctly, the block \nsequences increase in length with one block to a maximum of eight blocks. After three errors \nwithin the same sequence length, the test is stopped. The score that is obtained for both \nversions is the number of correctly remembered sequences (maximum = 18). \nThe Stop Task (Logan & Cowan, 1984; Logan, Cowan, & Davis, 1984). This computer \ntask provides an index of the child\u2019s ability to inhibit a prepared motor response. The task was \n 12\npresented as a game in which the child had to perform the tasks of an air traffic controller. \nFirst, the child was taught to respond to airplanes appearing on the computer screen by \npressing the response button that was on the same side as the airplane (a two-choice reaction \ntime task). Then, the child was told to withhold responding whenever he or she saw a big \nwhite cross (the \u2018stop\u2019 trials), but otherwise to keep on responding to the planes as quickly as \npossible (the \u2018go\u2019 trials). Each trial began with a 350 milliseconds presentation of a fixation \npoint (\u2018+\u2019-sign presented at the centre of the screen). The presentation of the stimulus (an \nairplane), displayed for 1500 milliseconds then followed. The inter-trial interval was 1000 \nmilliseconds. The stimuli appeared equally often on either side of the screen within each \nblock. The stop signals (white crosses) appeared at the centre of the screen, c.q. on top of the \nairplane. They were presented equally often after left- and right-sided presentations of the \nstimuli. A go trial always followed a stop trial, except once in each block where two stop \nsignals were presented in succession. The percentage of stop trials was 25%. A tracking \nalgorithm (for a detailed description of this procedure, see Scheres et al., 2003) was applied to \nvary dynamically the onset of the stop-signal in response to a participant\u2019s performance, such \nthat it is increased after a previously unsuccessful inhibition trial (making the next stop trial \nless difficult). This one-up/one-down tracking procedure ensures that a child has \napproximately 50% chance of response inhibition and controls for difficulty level across \nparticipants (Congdon et al., 2012).  \n313 \n314 \n315 \n316 \n317 \n318 \n319 \n320 \n321 \n322 \n323 \n324 \n325 \n326 \n327 \n328 \n329 \n330 \n331 \n332 \n333 \n334 \n335 \n336 \n337 \nAll children performed two practices and four experimental blocks (each consisting of \n64 trials) on this task and were given short breaks between blocks. The main dependent \nvariable in this task was the stop signal reaction time (SSRT). The speed of the stopping \nprocess, the SSRT cannot be observed, because the response to a stop signal is a covert one. \nThe SSRT can be estimated using the race model (Logan et al., 1984). According to this \nmodel the probability of inhibiting the response depends on the outcome of a race between the \n 13\n\u201cgo\u201d process and the stopping process. The process that finishes first wins the race. If the go \nprocess is faster than the stopping process, the child emits the response; if the stop process \nfinishes first, the response is inhibited. The outcome of the race depends on the speed and the \nvariability of the go process, the delay between the go stimulus and stop signal, and the speed \nand the variability of the stop process. SSRT can be calculated by subtracting the mean delay \nfrom the mean go signal reaction time (Scheres et al., 2003; for a more detailed description \nsee also Oosterlaan & Sergeant, 1998).  \n338 \n339 \n340 \n341 \n342 \n343 \n344 \n345 \n346 \n347 \n348 \n349 \n350 \n351 \n352 \n353 \n354 \n355 \n356 \n357 \n358 \n359 \n360 \n361 \nTreatment acceptability. A diary was completed by each child during the training. The \ndiary inquired daily about the acceptability and enjoyment of the training in general. Both \nclosed and open-ended formats were utilized. In particular, children were asked why they kept \ntraining and how much they liked the training sessions (visual analogue scale 1-10 from not \nfun to very fun). The scores < 5 were recoded as Less Fun (LF) and the scores >5 were \nrecoded as Fun (F). Furthermore, the children were asked if they tried hard enough to score \nwell (visual analogue scale 1-5 from a little to very much). The scores < 2.5 were recoded as \nLittle Hard (LH) and scores > 2.5 were recoded as Hard (H).  \nProcedure \nAt the start of the \u2018returning home phase\u2019 after 6 months of inpatient treatment and \nafter pretest, participants (N =  44) were randomly assigned to either a care-as-usual only \ncondition (CAU, n = 22) or to an active cognitive EF-training condition (CAU + EF-training, \nn = 22). Randomization (using random number generator by person blind to the study) was \nstratified on gender and age. Children who were randomized to the EF-training condition \nwere provided with a computer. It was ensured that this computer was placed at a location in \nthe clinic with limited distractions. Further, to limit distraction during the playing of the game \nchildren wore headphones and no contact with the Internet or other software was possible on \n 14\nthe computer. The training time was kept equal for all children in the training condition (25 \ntimes 40 minutes) to prevent variability in exposure. \n362 \n363 \n364 \n365 \n366 \n367 \n368 \n369 \n370 \n371 \n372 \n373 \n374 \n375 \n376 \n377 \n378 \n379 \n380 \n381 \n382 \n383 \n384 \n385 \nBefore the beginning of the EF- training, the pre-test was conducted. The children \n(n=44) were assessed in the clinic with the Raven, the Stop task and the Corsi Block Tapping \ntask  \u2013 forward and backward (counterbalanced). Furthermore childcare workers living daily \nwith the children were asked to complete the BRIEF-questionnaire assessing behavior of the \nchild more or less as a stand-in parent. One week after the 6-week training, participants in \nboth conditions and childcare workers received the same post-test measures, BMI was \ndetermined, and one week later the children left the clinic. One child was unable to complete \nthe posttest due to illness. A follow-up was conducted 8 weeks (n = 33) and 12 weeks (n = 36) \nafter the treatment program, children returned to the clinic for BMI determination. The \nassessors for the post-test and follow-up measures of our primary outcome measure BMI were \nblind to treatment condition. The Ethics Committee of the Ghent University approved the \nstudy. \nStatistical Analyses \n First, baseline differences between both the EF-training condition and the care-as-\nusual condition were tested using chi-square tests for categorical and ANOVAs for \ncontinuous variables. Then, a mixed factorial ANOVA model was fit to test pre-post \ndifferences between treatment conditions. We used repeated measures ANOVA with time of \nassessment as within factor (pre-test, post-test) and treatment condition as between factor (EF-\ntraining or CAU). Then to assess long-term effects, ANOVAs for repeated measures analyses \nwere conducted with time as within factor (pre - post- 8-weeks follow-up \u2013 12-weeks follow \nup) and condition as between factor. Effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s \u03b72, Cohen, 1988) are reported for \nall analyses. Following Cohen\u2019s guidelines effect sizes smaller than 0.06 were considered \n 15\nsmall, effect sizes between 0.06 and 0.14 were considered medium and effect sizes above 0.14 \nwere considered large. \n386 \n387 \n388 \n389 \n390 \n391 \n392 \n393 \n394 \n395 \n396 \n397 \n398 \n399 \n400 \n401 \n402 \n403 \n404 \n405 \n406 \n407 \n408 \n409 \n410 \n All data were available for 80% of the children at both follow ups. Analyses showed \nno significant baseline differences between participants with complete versus incomplete data \nat follow up. Moreover, comparison of means and covariances using Little\u2019s (1988) MCAR \ntest revealed that data were missing completely at random (\u03c7\u00b2888 = 923.84, ns). Therefore, \nmissing bodyweight values were estimated using maximum likelihood estimation (Schafer, \n1997) and the expectation maximization algorithm. \nResults \nDescriptive characteristics \nANOVAs and chi-square analyses tested for differences in demographic variables and \nbaseline differences on outcome measures between participants of both treatment conditions \n(see Table 1 & 2). There were no significant differences between the two conditions on any of \nthe variables. Outlier analysis showed no outliers on any of the dependent variables.  \n \nEvaluation of the EF-training on executive functioning \nRegarding child outcome measures, for both the Corsi Block Tapping Task forward \nand Corsi Block Tapping Task backward there were significant interaction effects. Children in \nthe EF-training condition showed more improvement in working memory than children in the \ncare as usual only condition. The Stop Task did not show significant time effects nor \ninteraction effects (see Table 3). \nTime effects were observed for some childcare worker outcome measures as described \nin Table 3. Comparing pretest \u2013posttest data on the BRIEF inhibition subscale did not show a \nsignificant interaction effect. However, comparing the BRIEF working memory subscale and \nthe BRIEF meta-cognition subscale showed significant interaction effects, with medium effect \n 16\nsizes. A trend-significant interaction effect was found on the BRIEF-total score (p= .075). The \nscores of the children in the EF-training group remained stable, while children in the care as \nusual only condition showed increased deficits in working memory and meta-cognition as \nmeasured by the BRIEF.  \n411 \n412 \n413 \n414 \n415 \n416 \n417 \n418 \n419 \n420 \n421 \n422 \n423 \n424 \n425 \n426 \n427 \n428 \n429 \n430 \n431 \n432 \n433 \n434 \n435 \n436 \n \nLong-term weight control effects \nRepeated measures ANOVAs were conducted on adjusted BMI with 4 time points \n(pretest-posttest-8 weeks follow up- 12 weeks follow up) as within group factor and treatment \ncondition as between factor (EF-training or CAU-only). There was a significant time by \ncondition effect for adjusted BMI qualified by a large effect size (see Table 4). Children in the \nEF-training condition showed better weight loss maintenance compared to the children in the \nCAU- only condition. Time by condition contrasts showed significant better weight loss \nmaintenance in the EF-training group specifically from posttest to 8 weeks follow up, \nqualified by a large effect size. This effect decreased to a non-significant difference at the 12 \nweeks follow up (see also Figure 2).  \n \nTreatment acceptability.  \nOf the 22 children in EF training condition, 19 completed the diaries. Among these \nchildren, 94.74% tried hard  to score well during the training tasks (mean VAS = 4.18, SD = \n.82) and 44.4% reported to experience the training sessions as fun (mean VAS = 5.95; SD = \n2.72).  \n \nTo explore possible gender differences and to control for possible age effects, analyses \nwere also run with gender as between factor and age as covariate. Results were similar as \ndescribed above (data available from first author).  \n \n 17\n 437 \n438 \n439 \n440 \n441 \n442 \n443 \n444 \n445 \n446 \n447 \n448 \n449 \n450 \n451 \n452 \n453 \n454 \n455 \n456 \n457 \n458 \n459 \n460 \n461 \nDiscussion \nThis study is the first evaluation of the acceptability and effectiveness of adding \ncognitive EF-training with game elements to a 10-month inpatient treatment programme for \nobese children in the \u2018returning home phase\u2019. Overall, the training sessions were well \ntolerated and had reasonable acceptability ratings from the children. The impact of the \nintervention was explored on two measures of executive functioning and on weight loss and \nweight-loss maintenance after discharge from the clinic. Not only did the EF-training improve \nthe children\u2019s executive functioning skills, mainly working memory, but also, compared to the \nchildren in the CAU condition, the children who completed the EF-training appeared to be \nmore capable of maintaining their weight-loss at 8 weeks\u2019 post-training. These results are \nnoteworthy, especially since to date evidence shows that treatment for obesity is typically \nfollowed by weight regain. Therefore, strengthening in the patient the skills that enable better \nlong-term weight control may be the main challenge in the treatment of obesity (Latner et al., \n2000).  \nWe can speculate as to why this EF-training may have a surplus value in improving \nweight-loss maintenance. After leaving the clinic, the children are assumed to maintain the \nlearned healthy lifestyle behaviours aimed at keeping a healthy weight over their lifespan. \nResearch has provided some evidence that neurocognitive factors may be implicated in these \npatterns of healthy behaviour over the lifespan (Deary, Whiteman, Starr, Whalley, & Fox, \n2004; Gottfredson, & Deary, 2004), especially executive functions (Hall, Elias, & Crossley, \n2006). In line with previous research (e.g. Klingberg et al., 2005; Thorell et al., 2009), our \ndata suggest that specifically working memory capacity can be expanded through targeted EF-\ntraining, with a significant increase in performance over 6 weeks and also notably better \nweight maintenance when returning home at 8 weeks\u2019 follow-up.  \n 18\nOther studies in ADHD samples did show generalization of the effects of WM training \nto other executive functions such as inhibition (Klingberg, 2010). We could not find such \neffects on inhibition as measured with the Stop Task. It may be that our task was not sensitive \nenough to measure subtle advances in inhibition abilities or that inhibition is not trainable \nwith this programme. However, analyses of the inhibition scores of the training task indicated \nsignificant improvement in all participants from the first to the last session suggesting \npromising potential also for the training of inhibition (data available from first author). \nTherefore it seems reasonable to assume that the present 25 session-intervention may have \ntrained both executive functions to some degree, but not enough to observe significant \nchanges on the Stop Task.  \n462 \n463 \n464 \n465 \n466 \n467 \n468 \n469 \n470 \n471 \n472 \n473 \n474 \n475 \n476 \n477 \n478 \n479 \n480 \n481 \n482 \n483 \n484 \n485 \n486 \nWeight maintenance effects were no longer visible at 12 weeks\u2019 follow-up. This is in \nline with other training studies in children and adults showing that training-related gains were \nstable for a number of weeks but were lost thereafter (Holmes et al., 2010; Buschkuehl et al., \n2008). It seems likely that EF functions need permanent training and therefore it would be \nworthwhile testing whether a reasonable schedule of \u201cmaintenance\u201d EF-training could further \nhelp children control their weight. \nThe study produced an expected finding on the BRIEF- data obtained by the childcare \nworkers. While children from the EF-training group demonstrated maintenance of their pre-\ntest level, at post-test a significant reduction in executive functioning was observed in the \nCAU control group. This seems at first sight somewhat surprising. We assume that these \nresults must be interpreted in the light of the new challenges these children were faced with \nduring the third phase of the inpatient programme. In the final weeks of this treatment, the \nrigid structure is gradually attenuated and more frequent home visits are implemented, which \ninclude more food temptations to overcome. Furthermore, anticipating the departure from the \nclinic and the upcoming summer holiday may have caused more arousal and emotions, \n 19\nthereby limiting the capacity for inhibited behaviour. This in turn was reflected in the \nreduction of observed executive functioning in the CAU group. The maintenance of a good \nlevel of executive functioning may therefore in itself be interpreted as a good progression in \nthe children as a result of the EF training.  \n487 \n488 \n489 \n490 \n491 \n492 \n493 \n494 \n495 \n496 \n497 \n498 \n499 \n500 \n501 \n502 \n503 \n504 \n505 \n506 \n507 \n508 \n509 \n510 \n511 \nThere are a number of strengths and weaknesses of this study that need to be considered \nin interpreting it. The strengths of this study include the use of a novel intervention, based on \na theoretical model of causal and maintenance mechanisms of overweight and obesity in \nchildren. Additionally, we used different cognitive tasks and ratings to assess EF-functioning. \nEstimates of efficacy are often based only on assessments made by individuals likely to be \naware of study allocation and who are in some way or another biased (e.g. participate in the \ntreatment), which may inflate effect sizes. In the current study large effects were found on the \nmost objective, clinically relevant and \u2018blind\u2019 outcome measure: BMI. Although weight loss \nis the most important outcome measure, the fact that it was not possible to assess EF at \nfollow-up must be seen as a limitation of this study. Furthermore, future research should try to \nunravel mechanisms of change and how this EF-training works precisely in obese samples. \nDismantling research is necessary to examine whether the positive effects of the EF-training \nare accounted for by the working memory component, the inhibition training component or \nthe combination of the two. We also wonder, for example, whether the trained capacity in \nworking memory is related to weight loss through self-controlled food-intake. More \nspecifically, we need also more data that evidenced the assumed link between working \nmemory and weight-control behaviors, which could significantly strengthen the theoretical \nbasis for this treatment program \nThis study is somewhat limited in power. Larger randomized controlled trials are worth \nconsidering. This way it would be possible to identify potential moderators in order to \ndetermine which obese children might respond best to this intervention. Nevertheless, even \n 20\nwith only 44 inpatient and severely clinical disturbed patients and with a care-as-usual-only \ncontrol group, we did find moderate to large effects on the most clinical relevant measures.  \n512 \n513 \n514 \n515 \n516 \n517 \n518 \n519 \n520 \n521 \n522 \n523 \n524 \n525 \n526 \n527 \n528 \n529 \n530 \n531 \n532 \n533 \n534 \n535 \n536 \n For this first study of EF-training in obese children, we deemed an active control \ngroup (e.g. non-adaptive computer tasks) as used by Klingberg et al (2005) not feasible. First, \nnon-adaptive computer tasks contain little to no challenges for children, and would have lead \nto possible motivational problems. Second, the staff of the clinic anticipated that installing an \nequally attractive intervention for the control group could have led to organisational problems, \nmitigation and more drop-outs. Therefore, non-specific treatment effects in the EF-training \ncondition (such as the attention of the childcare workers) were not controlled for. However, \nthe significant long-term effects on weight-loss maintenance found in the EF-training \ncondition do in fact provide indications towards true unbiased effects of the training.  \nIn order to tackle the mentioned feasibility problems, in future research an active control \ngroup can consist of children in the residential setting playing tetris on a hand computer 40 \nminutes each training day. As the current sample was a clinical sample receiving inpatient \ntreatment, the findings may not be generalizable to outpatient clinical groups. It is \nrecommended that future research replicate the findings in an outpatient setting of obese \nchildren, for example. as homework  in the termination phase of an ambulant treatment. \nNowadays, most children have a computer at home where it is easier to organize the daily \nscreen time for each child. Furthermore possible motivational problems are easier to deal with \nin a one-to-one situation.. \n In sum, the intervention tested in this study may serve as the basis for future research \nwhich examines interventions targeting overweight and obesity in children. Although \ntreatment programmes already attest to the importance of self-regulatory skills for weight-\ncontrol, consideration of self-regulatory abilities represent a fascinating new area of research. \nThis study shows promising evidence of the efficacy of EF-training in obese children. Future \n 21\nstudies should replicate and disentangle these positive treatment effects in order to explore \nspecific effects for each EF-task, motivational aspects of the gaming environment and, \nultimately, which EF-training component would be most effective for each specific child, \nwith their specific executive (dis)functioning profile. \n537 \n538 \n539 \n540 \n541 \n542 \n543 \n544 \n545 \n546 \n547 \n548 \n549 \n550 \n551 \n552 \n553 \n554 \n555 \n556 \n557 \n558 \n559 \n560 \n561 \nAcknowledgments \nThe authors thank the Zeepreventorium De Haan staff and all of the children for participating \nin this study.

Despite that the\nnature and the functions of microsaccades are still lively\ndebated, recent evidence has shown an association\nbetween these micro eye movements and higher order\ncognitive processes. Here, in two experiments, we\nspecifically focused on working memory and addressed\nwhether differential memory load could be reflected in a\nmodulation of microsaccade dynamics. In Experiment 1,\nparticipants memorized a numerical sequence composed\nof either two (low-load condition) or five digits (high-\nload condition), appearing at fixation. The results\nshowed a reduction in the microsaccadic rate in the high-\nload compared to the low-load condition. In Experiment\n2, five red or green digits were always presented at\nfixation. Participants either memorized the color (low-\nload condition) or the five digits (high-load condition).\nHence, visual stimuli were exactly the same in both\nconditions. Consistent with Experiment 1, microsaccadic\nrate was lower in the high-load than in the low-load\ncondition. Overall, these findings reveal that an\nengagement of working memory can have an impact on\nmicrosaccadic rate, consistent with the view that\nmicrosaccade generation is pervious to top-down\nprocesses.\nIntroduction\nOur eyes never stop. Even when we try to hold our\neyes as still as possible, tiny, involuntary, and\nunconscious eye movements take place. These \u2018\u2018\ufb01xa-\ntional\u2019\u2019 eye movements can be classi\ufb01ed in three distinct\ncategories: drift, tremor, and microsaccades. Even if all\nthese \ufb01xational movements are important for vision,\nduring the last \ufb01fteen years the study of microsaccades\nhas experienced the most \ufb02ourishing interest among\nresearchers (see Rolfs, 2009).\nMicrosaccades are the largest of \ufb01xational eye\nmovements (, 0.58\u201318; see Collewijn & Kowler, 2008;\nMartinez-Conde, Macknik, Troncoso, & Hubel, 2009;\nMartinez-Conde, Otero-Millan, & Macknik, 2013;\nPoletti & Rucci, 2016; see also Nystro\u00a8m, Hansen,\nAndersson, & Hooge, 2016). Generally, during \ufb01xation,\nthe base frequency of microsaccades is about one or\ntwo per second (see Martinez-Conde et al., 2013).\nHowever, after perceptual transients, they show a\npeculiar rate signature characterized by an inhibition\nphase, followed by a rebound phase and a return to the\nbaseline (see Engbert & Kliegl, 2003; Hafed &\nIgnashchenkova, 2013; Rolfs, 2009). Moreover, as\nsuggested by their name, microsaccades also share a\nvariety of characteristics with saccades (see Martinez-\nConde et al., 2009): For instance, microsaccades are\ngenerally binocular (Ciuffreda & Tannen, 1995; see also\nGautier, Bedell, Siderov, & Waugh, 2016) and charac-\nterized by a positive correlation between their ampli-\ntude and peak velocity, a pattern known as \u2018\u2018main\nsequence\u2019\u2019 (Zuber, Stark, & Cook, 1965).\nThe vast majority of the studies concerning micro-\nsaccades attempted to delineate their role both for\nvision and perception. In this regard, it seems that\nmicrosaccades contribute to the maintenance of a\nprecise \ufb01xation by correcting displacements due to\ndrifts (e.g., Engbert & Kliegl, 2004) or eye blinks (e.g.,\nCostela et al., 2014), and prevent both foveal and\nperipheral image fading by keeping retinal image in\nmotion (e.g., Costela, McCamy, Macknik, Otero-\nCitation: Dalmaso, M., Castelli, L., Scatturin, P., & Galfano, G.

Working memory load modulates microsaccadic rate.\nJournal of Vision, 17(3):6, 1\u201312, doi:10.1167/17.3.6.\nJournal of Vision (2017) 17(3):6, 1\u201312 1\ndoi: 10 .1167 /17 .3 .6 ISSN 1534-7362 Copyright 2017 The AuthorsReceived October 4, 2016; published March 9, 2017\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\nDownloaded From: http://jov.arvojournals.org/pdfaccess.ashx?url=/data/journals/jov/936104/ on 03/14/2017\nMillan, & Martinez-Conde, 2013; Martinez-Conde,\nMacknik, Troncoso, & Dyar, 2006; McCamy et al.,\n2012; McCamy, Macknik, & Martinez-Conde, 2014).\nFurthermore, microsaccades are also involved in visual\nsearch within small regions (e.g., Otero-Millan, Tron-\ncoso, Macknik, Serrano-Pedraza, & Martinez-Conde,\n2008), in tasks that require substantial visual precision\n(e.g., Ko, Poletti, & Rucci, 2010) and in information\nacquisition during the scanning of natural scenes\n(McCamy, Otero-Millan, Di Stasi, Macknik, & Mar-\ntinez-Conde, 2014). Even if a full consensus about the\npossible functions of microsaccades has not yet been\nachieved (e.g., Collewijn & Kowler, 2008; Martinez-\nConde et al., 2009; Martinez-Conde et al., 2013; Poletti\n& Rucci, 2016; Rolfs, 2009), their relevance for our\nvisual system is unquestionable.\nAnother fascinating stream of studies provided\nevidence suggesting that microsaccades are associated\neven with some higher cognitive mechanisms. For\ninstance, in a set of experiments, Engbert and Kliegl\n(2003) observed that the direction of microsaccades was\ncorrelated with the direction of attentional shifts\nelicited by predictive symbolic cues presented at\n\ufb01xation (see also Pastukhov & Braun, 2010), a \ufb01nding\nreported even in response to central social stimuli (i.e.,\neye-gaze direction; Deaner & Platt, 2003; Yokoyama,\nNoguchi, & Kita, 2012) and peripheral cues (e.g., Betta,\nGalfano, & Turatto, 2007; Galfano, Betta, & Turatto,\n2004; Hafed & Clark, 2002; Rolfs, Engbert, & Kliegl,\n2005). Preparatory processes could also impact on\nmicrosaccadic response, as a decrement in their\nabsolute frequency has been reported when participants\nare asked to provide a manual response to an upcoming\nsignal, as compared with a condition in which no\nmanual response is required (Betta & Turatto, 2006).\nRecent research evidence has been reported showing\nthat microsaccades statistics can be modulated by\nseveral factors such as the perceptual awareness of the\nstimuli (White & Rolfs, 2016) and the perceptual\nproperties of the stimuli (e.g., Bonneh, Adini, & Polat,\n2015; Rolfs, Kliegl, & Engbert, 2008). More relevant\nfor the present study, a decrement in microsaccadic\nfrequency has been documented when individuals were\ninvolved in mental counting and arithmetic (Gao, Yan,\n& Sun, 2015; Siegenthaler et al., 2014; Valsecchi, Betta,\n& Turatto, 2007). In more detail, Valsecchi et al. (2007)\nemployed a visual oddball task and observed that\nmicrosaccadic rate was lower in response to rare visual\ntargets, but only when participants were required to\nactively count these occurrences. Interestingly, the\ndecrement of microsaccadic rate was observed only in\nthe rebound phase. On the contrary, when participants\nwere asked to look at the stimuli passively (i.e., without\ncounting), microsaccadic rate did not differ between\nstandard and rare stimuli (for similar results see also\nValsecchi, Dimigen, Kliegl, Sommer, & Turatto, 2009;\nValsecchi & Turatto, 2007, 2009). More recently,\nSiegenthaler et al. (2014) and Gao et al. (2015) found\nan inverse relation between task dif\ufb01culty and micro-\nsaccadic rate. In more detail, Siegenthaler et al. (2014)\nasked participants to mentally count forward (low\ndif\ufb01culty) or backward (high dif\ufb01culty) while looking\nat a \ufb01xation spot that was the only visual stimulus\nemployed in the task. On the other hand, Gao et al.\n(2015) asked participants to sum or to subtract, from a\nvisually presented number, a second one that could be\neither small (low dif\ufb01culty) or large (high dif\ufb01culty). In\nboth studies, when participants were asked to perform\ndif\ufb01cult arithmetic, an overall decrement in micro-\nsaccadic rate was observed (Gao et al., 2015; Sie-\ngenthaler et al., 2014). Interestingly, the decrement\nreported by Gao et al. (2015) emerged in the rebound\nphase, in line with Valsecchi et al. (2007, 2009).\nCrucially, in all the aforementioned studies (Gao et\nal., 2015; Siegenthaler et al., 2014; Valsecchi et al.,\n2007, 2009), a latent mechanism could have contributed\nto the modulation of microsaccadic rate: working\nmemory (e.g., Baddeley, 1992). Indeed, the participants\nwere requested to perform complex mental operations\nas, for instance, forward versus backward counting\n(Siegenthaler et al., 2014), or arithmetic veri\ufb01cation\ntasks (Gao et al., 2015) that are known to call into play\ndifferent arithmetic operations such as carrying and\nborrowing (e.g., DeStefano & LeFevre, 2004). Whereas\nthere is a well-established, albeit indirect, link between\nthis type of tasks and the involvement of working\nmemory, as shown by the fact that performance in\nthese tasks is impaired by concomitant high-demanding\nsecondary tasks (e.g., Logie, Gilhooly, & Wynn, 1994,\nalso see DeStefano & LeFevre, 2004), arithmetic tasks\ninvolve several processing stages and operations that\nare highly domain-speci\ufb01c (e.g., Dehaene, Molko,\nCohen, & Wilson, 2004). Following this reasoning, the\nevidence of a link between working memory and\nmicrosaccade dynamics is still indirect and in need of\nfurther investigation.\nThe present study represents the \ufb01rst attempt to\ndirectly assess the potential role of working memory in\nshaping microsaccadic rate. In two experiments,\nparticipants were asked to hold in memory a shorter\n(low-load condition) or a longer (high-load condition)\nlist of items, applying a standard test of working\nmemory, namely a modi\ufb01ed version of the Sternberg\ntask (Sternberg, 1966, 1975). At the same time, they\nwere also asked to maintain \ufb01xation on a central spot.\nIn more detail, in Experiment 1, at the beginning of\neach trial participants were required to memorize a\nnumerical sequence composed of either two digits (low-\nload condition) or \ufb01ve digits (high-load condition) that\nappeared at \ufb01xation. After this learning phase, the\ndigits disappeared and the retention phase started.\nFinally, a memory test was administered. Experiment 2\nJournal of Vision (2017) 17(3):6, 1\u201312 Dalmaso, Castelli, Scatturin, & Galfano 2\nDownloaded From: http://jov.arvojournals.org/pdfaccess.ashx?url=/data/journals/jov/936104/ on 03/14/2017\nhad the same structure, but the numerical sequence was\nalways composed of \ufb01ve digits all colored in either red\nor green. Participants were asked to memorize either\nthe color (low-load condition) or the digits (high-load\ncondition) of the numerical sequence. In so doing, the\nsame visual stimuli were employed in both conditions.\nIn both experiments, in the retention phase (i.e., when\nthe numerical stimuli were not physically available to\nthe participants) we expected to observe a decrement in\nmicrosaccadic rate in the high-load condition as\ncompared to the low-load condition. Based on previous\nstudies (Valsecchi et al., 2007, 2009; see also Gao et al.,\n2015), we expected to observe this reduction especially\nduring the rebound phase, whereas we had no speci\ufb01c\npredictions about eventual differences in the postre-\nbound sustained activity.\nMethods\nExperiment 1\nParticipants\nParticipants were 24 undergraduates (Mean age\u00bc 22\nyears, SD\u00bc 1.6, 13 males, 11 females) with normal or\ncorrected-to-normal vision who took part in exchange\nof course credits. All the participants were na\u0131\u00a8ve to the\npurpose of the experiment. The study has been\nconducted in accordance with the Declaration of\nHelsinki.\nApparatus\nEye movements were recorded binocularly at 500 Hz\nby using an EyeLink 1000 Plus (SR Research Ltd.,\nOttawa, Canada). Participants sat approximately 65 cm\naway from a 24-in monitor (12803 1024 pixels, 120\nHz). A chinrest was used in order to prevent head\nmovements. A display PC running Experiment Builder\n(SR Research Ltd.) handled timing and stimuli\npresentation.\nProcedure\nColor background was set to gray and stimuli were\nset to black. A nine-point calibration and a validation\nprocedure were followed by the experimental session.\nBefore each trial, participants were asked to \ufb01xate on a\ncentrally placed circle (0.48 in diameter), and then the\nexperimenter initiated the trial through the host PC.\nThis procedure ensured that participants \ufb01xated on the\ncenter of the screen and allowed us to perform a drift\nchecking. A successful drift checking was accompanied\nby a brief tone that informed the participants of the\nimminent start of the trial.\nEach trial began with the presentation of a centrally\nplaced circle (0.48 in diameter) that remained on the\nscreen for the whole duration of the trial (Figure 1,\nFixation frame). After 500 ms, a numerical sequence\n(14-point Arial) composed of either two digits (low-\nload condition; 0.38 3 height 0.58 width) or \ufb01ve digits\n(high-load condition, 0.383height 1.38 width) appeared\n0.48 above the circle for 1500 ms. In both conditions,\ndigits were randomly selected from the range 1\u20139, with\nthe constraint that a given digit could only appear once\nin the sequence. Participants were asked to memorize\nthe digits while maintaining their eyes on the centrally\nplaced circle (Figure 1, Learning frame). After that, the\ndigits disappeared for 2000 ms (Figure 1, Retention\nframe). Finally, two probe digits reappeared 0.48 above\nthe central circle and remained visible until the\nparticipant responded or 3000 ms were elapsed,\nwhichever came \ufb01rst (Figure 1, Test frame). Partici-\npants were asked to provide a manual response on a\nstandard keyboard (keys D or K, counterbalanced\nacross participants) to decide whether the two probe\ndigits were presented in the same order as they had\nbeen presented in the learning frame (for a similar\nprocedure see, for instance, Dalton, Lavie, & Spence,\n2009). Responses had to be as accurate as possible and\nwithout speed pressure. After each response, a \ufb01rst\nvisual feedback (500 ms) informed the participants\nabout their performance; then a second visual feedback\n(1000 ms) invited the participants to blink, if needed.\nParticipants were instructed to maintain their eyes\non the \ufb01xation spot and to avoid blinking for the whole\ntrial duration; otherwise in both cases a visual feedback\nappeared for 1000 ms, and the trial was automatically\naborted and appended at the end of the session. This\nallowed us to collect a reasonable number of blink-free\nepochs while avoiding an excessive duration of the\nexperiment. In either low- and high-load conditions, 15\npractice trials were followed by 80 experimental trials.\nA short break was allowed every 20 trials. Block order\nwas counterbalanced across participants. The whole\nexperiment lasted about 1 hr.\nResults\nWorking memory task: Data from one participant were\nremoved because his accuracy rate in the high-load\ncondition approached chance level (48.8%), leaving the\nsample composed of 23 individuals (Mean age\u00bc 22\nyears, SD\u00bc 1.6, 12 males, nine females).\nAs for accuracy data, the percentage of missed\nresponses was very low (0.5%) and therefore no further\nanalyses were carried out. The percentage of incorrect\nresponses (9%) was analyzed through a two-tailed\npaired t test comparing low- and high-load conditions,\nand the results con\ufb01rmed the presence of a signi\ufb01cant\ndifference, t(22)\u00bc 6.86, p , 0.001, d . 1. Furthermore,\nJournal of Vision (2017) 17(3):6, 1\u201312 Dalmaso, Castelli, Scatturin, & Galfano 3\nDownloaded From: http://jov.arvojournals.org/pdfaccess.ashx?url=/data/journals/jov/936104/ on 03/14/2017\nin order to assess which model (i.e., H0 vs. H1) was\nmore likely supported by the current data, the Bayes\nFactor (BF; e.g., Rouder, Speckman, Sun, Morey, &\nIverson, 2009) was also computed. This analysis\nindicated that, as expected, the model supporting H1\n(i.e., low-load condition 6\u00bc high-load condition) was\npreferable over the model supporting H0 (i.e., low-load\ncondition\u00bc high-load condition), BF10 . 150. Specif-\nically, participants committed fewer errors in the low-\nload condition (M\u00bc 1.9%, SE\u00bc 0.52) than in the high-\nload condition (M \u00bc 15.7%, SE\u00bc 1.97; see Figure 2).\nAs for reaction times (RTs), the latencies of correct\nresponses were analyzed through a two-tailed paired t\ntest between low- and high-load conditions, con\ufb01rming\nthe presence of a signi\ufb01cant difference, t(22)\u00bc 16.08, p\n, 0.001, d . 1. BF analysis indicated that H1 was\npreferable over H0, BF10 . 150. RTs were smaller in\nthe low-load condition (M\u00bc 689 ms, SE\u00bc 24) than in\nthe high-load condition (M \u00bc 1342 ms, SE\u00bc 48).\nOverall, these results indicate that the manipulation\nof working memory load was effective.\nMicrosaccadic rate: Microsaccades were detected and\nanalyzed by employing a modi\ufb01ed version of the\nalgorithm proposed by Engbert and Kliegl (2003),\nadapted for the 500-Hz sampling frequency used in the\npresent study and implemented in MATLAB. The\nvelocity threshold was set to k \u00bc 4 whereas the\nminimum duration threshold was set to four samples\n(e.g., Gautier et al., 2016). Finally, only binocular\nmicrosaccades on correctly responded trials and with a\nmaximum amplitude of 18 were considered (see\nMartinez-Conde et al., 2009, 2013).\nWe focused our analyses on 1000-ms epochs centered\naround the retention period (Figure 1, Retention\nframe). These epochs started 200 ms before the\ndisappearance of the digits and ended 800 ms after.\nFirstly, we tested whether in the present study we\ndetected microsaccades accurately. Since it is well\nknown that most microsaccades, similarly to saccades,\nFigure 2. Mean accuracy and reaction times observed in the\nmanual task of Experiment 1. Error bars depict the standard\nerror of the mean. Smaller RTs and fewer errors in the low-\nload condition\u2014as compared to the high-load condition\u2014\nconfirmed that the manipulation of working memory load was\neffective.\nFigure 1. Stimuli (not drawn to scale) and sequence of events for Experiment 1. Participants were asked to fixate on the central spot\nfor the whole duration of the trial, and to provide a manual response in the \u2018\u2018Test frame.\u2019\u2019 Panel A depicts a trial of the low-load\ncondition, in which the probe digits in the \u2018\u2018Test frame\u2019\u2019 were presented in the opposite order as they had been presented in the\nlearning frame. Panel B depicts a trial of the high-load condition, in which the probe digits in the \u2018\u2018Test frame\u2019\u2019 were presented in the\nsame order as they had been presented in the learning frame.\nJournal of Vision (2017) 17(3):6, 1\u201312 Dalmaso, Castelli, Scatturin, & Galfano 4\nDownloaded From: http://jov.arvojournals.org/pdfaccess.ashx?url=/data/journals/jov/936104/ on 03/14/2017\nshow a peculiar positive correlation between amplitude\nand peak velocity (the \u2018\u2018main sequence,\u2019\u2019 Zuber et al.,\n1965), we performed a correlation analysis between\nthese two measures. The results con\ufb01rmed that\namplitude and peak velocity were positively correlated,\nr(4594)\u00bc 0.574, p , 0.001 (see Figure 3). BF analyses\ncon\ufb01rmed that H1 (amplitude correlates with peak\nvelocity) was preferable over H0 (amplitude does not\ncorrelate with peak velocity), BF10 . 150. Hence,\nmicrosaccades were identi\ufb01ed correctly.\nSecondly, we computed the microsaccadic rate\nwithin the 1000-ms epochs. This was achieved by\ncalculating microsaccadic rate separately for each\nparticipant and experimental condition, and then\naveraging these data across participants. As depicted in\nFigure 4, after the disappearance of the digits (t\u00bc 0),\nmicrosaccadic rate showed a period of inhibition\nfollowed by period of rebound. Overall, this pattern of\nresults is fully consistent with previous evidence (see\nRolfs, 2009). In order to test our hypothesis, we\nfocused our main analysis in a 200-ms time window\nroughly centered around the rebound period (i.e., 200\u2013\n400 ms). Furthermore, other two 200-ms time windows\nwere extracted before (0\u2013200 ms, inhibition period) and\nafter (400\u2013600 ms, baseline period) our critical time\nwindow. Two-tailed paired t tests were performed\nbetween microsaccades observed in the low-load and in\nthe high-load conditions in each of the three windows.\nThe only signi\ufb01cant result emerging from this analysis\nwas that concerning the 200-400 ms time window, t(22)\n\u00bc 2.02, p , 0.05, d\u00bc 0.4, due to more microsaccades in\nthe low-load condition (M\u00bc 1.5 Hz, SE\u00bc 0.16) than in\nthe high-load condition (M \u00bc 1.2 Hz, SE \u00bc 0.11). BF\nanalysis indicated that H1 was preferable over H0, BF10\n\u00bc 1.2. The comparisons involving the control time\nwindows (0\u2013200 ms and 400\u2013600 ms) did not yield any\nsigni\ufb01cant effect (ts , 1, ps . 0.8, BF10s , 1, two-\ntailed).1\nAdditional analyses were also performed to explore\nwhether WM load exerted any effect on microsaccadic\nrate during the learning frame. These analyses were\nperformed using different a priori-determined time\nwindows (150-ms and 200-ms steps) as well as\nconsidering the whole 1500-ms time window. No\nsigni\ufb01cant differences emerged.\nExperiment 2\nOverall, the results of Experiment 1 suggest that\nworking memory load plays a key role in shaping\nmicrosaccadic rate. More speci\ufb01cally, during the\nrebound period, fewer microsaccades were observed in\nthe high-load condition than in the low-load condition.\nHowever, it should be noted that during the learning\nframe participants were exposed to two perceptually\ndifferent visual stimuli, namely a numerical sequence\nFigure 3. Positive correlation between amplitude and peak\nvelocity in Experiment 1. This \u2018\u2018main sequence\u2019\u2019 (see Zuber et\nal., 1965) confirmed that microsaccades were correctly\nidentified. The plot is based on 4,594 microsaccades.\nFigure 4.

At the same time,\nthey \ufb01xated on a centrally-placed spot and eye\nmovements were recorded binocularly. In both exper-\niments, the results revealed that microsaccadic rate was\ninversely related to working memory load: Fewer\nmicrosaccades were performed in the high-load condi-\ntion as compared to the low-load condition.\nThe existence of a relationship between working\nmemory and eye movements has been previously\ndocumented through several oculomotor measures\nother than microsaccades. For instance, there is\nevidence that saccadic latency (Schaeffer, Chi, Krafft,\nLi, Schwarz, & McDowell, 2015), saccadic suppression\n(Mitchell, Macrae, & Gilchrist, 2002; Roberts, Hager,\n& Heron, 1994), saccadic curvature (Theeuwes, Olivers,\n& Chizk, 2005) and even the pupillary light re\ufb02ex\n(Blom, Matho\u02c6t, Olivers, & Van der Stigchel, 2016), are\nin\ufb02uenced by mechanisms related to working memory\nfunctioning. A possible explanation for this link calls\ninto question the potential role of the Superior\nColliculus (SC). Indeed, it is well known that the SC is\nhighly engaged during the execution of saccadic eye\nmovements (Hafed & Chen, 2016; Sparks, 1988), and\nthere is also evidence supporting a role of the SC in\nboth saccadic curvature (Van der Stigchel, Meeter, &\nTheeuwes, 2006) and pupil response (Wang, Boehnke,\nWhite, & Munoz, 2012). Also for microsaccades, even\nif the neural pathway that would support these tiny\nmovements is still debated (e.g., Otero-Millan, Mack-\nnik, Serra, Leigh, & Martinez-Conde, 2011), converg-\ning evidence indicates the rostral pole of the SC as the\nmost likely neural generator of microsaccades (e.g.,\nHafed, Goffart, & Krauzlis, 2009; see also Martinez-\nConde et al., 2013). This notion is also in line with a\nmodel of microsaccade generation put forward by\nRolfs et al., (2008), which correctly predicted the\ninvolvement of the rostral pole of the SC in micro-\nsaccades before neurophysiological data were available.\nAt the same time, there is also evidence that some\noutput neurons of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a\ncortical area that plays a crucial role in working\nmemory (e.g., Gilbert et al., 2006), directly project to\nthe SC during working memory tasks (Johnston &\nEverling, 2009). Moreover, a recent study (Shen,\nBezgin, Selvam, McIntosh, & Ryan, 2016) has pro-\nposed the existence of a broad neural network that\nwould mediate the exchange of information between\nmemory and oculomotor systems. Taken together,\nthese pieces of evidence seem to suggest that ongoing\nmemory tasks can modulate the SC functioning and, in\nturn, this modulation might be re\ufb02ected in oculomotor\nresponses.\nAnother coherent pattern of results emerging from\nthe present experiments is that, whereas the micro-\nsaccadic response in the low- and high-load conditions\nwas virtually identical during the inhibition phase, a\nclear difference emerged in the rebound phase. This\ndifference between the inhibition and the rebound\nphases is fully consistent with previous studies in which\nworking memory has likely played a role (e.g.,\nValsecchi et al., 2007, 2009; see also Gao et al., 2015)\nand, more in general, is in line with the present\nknowledge concerning microsaccadic generation. In-\ndeed, because the inhibition phase arises very quickly\nafter perceptual transients, it is likely that this behavior\nmight re\ufb02ect the involvement of a fast subcortical\npathway. This could explain why the inhibition phase\nseems particularly stable and robust across studies. On\nthe other hand, the rebound phase requires, by\nde\ufb01nition, more time to emerge and several higher-\norder cognitive processes can therefore take place and\nin\ufb02uence this stage (see Engbert, 2006; see also Rolfs,\n2009). Even if the precise mechanisms shaping this\nbiphasic microsaccadic response are not entirely\nunderstood, it seems clear that microsaccades cannot\nbe merely con\ufb01ned to oculomotor responses supporting\nvision, but rather they might also be considered as a\nmultifaceted index of cognitive processing. Important-\nly, Gao et al. (2015) observed that sustained cognitive\nactivity was associated with a long-lasting reduced\nmicrosaccadic rate for the high-dif\ufb01culty condition,\nwhereas we observed no differences in the postrebound\nphase. In this regard, however, it should be noted that\nparticipants in Gao et al. (2015) and in the present\nexperiments were likely involved in very different\nmental operations. Indeed, in the time window in which\nmicrosaccades were detected by Gao et al. (2015),\nparticipants had to compute additions/subtractions (see\nalso Zhou et al., 2006, for electrophysiological sup-\nporting evidence) whereas in the current experiments\nretention in WM was the only mental operation\nrequired. This key difference might explain why the\ndifference in microsaccadic rate between low and high\nload was much more sustained in the study by Gao et\nal. (2015) than in the present experiments.\nThe results of the present experiments are also\naligned with a stream of studies that observed a\nmicrosaccadic modulation due to mental tasks. Indeed,\nwhile microsaccades have been traditionally examined\nin association with perceptual stimulation, both in the\nvisual (e.g., Engbert & Kliegl, 2003; Ko et al., 2010;\nMcCamy et al., 2012) and in the auditory modalities\n(e.g., Rolfs, Engbert, & Kliegl, 2005; Rolfs et al., 2008),\nJournal of Vision (2017) 17(3):6, 1\u201312 Dalmaso, Castelli, Scatturin, & Galfano 8\nDownloaded From: http://jov.arvojournals.org/pdfaccess.ashx?url=/data/journals/jov/936104/ on 03/14/2017\nonly few studies investigated the additional role of\nhigher order cognitive processing, such as mental\narithmetic, on microsaccade dynamics (Gao et al.,\n2015; Siegenthaler et al., 2014). Here, we con\ufb01rmed\nthat even a pure working memory manipulation is\nre\ufb02ected in microsaccadic rate. In this regard, it is\nimportant to note that in Experiment 2 the visual\ndisplays in both low- and high-load conditions were\nphysically identical (for a similar approach, see also\nSiegenthaler et al., 2014), unlike Experiment 1 in which\nthe displays in the learning frame were composed of\neither two (low-load condition) or \ufb01ve (high-load\ncondition) digits. Because in both experiments the\nresults were virtually identical, it is reasonable to\nconclude that they have been shaped by mental\nmechanisms related to working memory, rather than by\nmere perceptual processes.\nTo conclude, this study suggests the existence of a\nlink between working memory and the microsaccadic\ngenerator system and strengthens the idea that even\ninvoluntary and unconscious \ufb01xational eye move-\nments\u2014such as microsaccades\u2014are pervious to higher\nlevel cognitive mechanisms that are not primarily\ninvolved in either vision or perceptual mechanisms.\nConclusion\nIn two experiments, we revealed that working\nmemory load shapes microsaccadic rate. In particular,\nin the high-load condition a lower microsaccadic rate\nwas observed with respect to the low-load condition.\nThese results con\ufb01rm that microsaccades are sensitive\nto higher order cognitive processes and prompt us to\nconsider these microscopic eye movements as a\npowerful and noninvasive tool that can be used to shed\nfresh light on the fascinating interplay between vision,\neye movements, and cognition.\nKeywords: microsaccades, working memory, eye\nmovements\nAcknowledgments\nThe present research was \ufb01nancially supported by\nthe Italian Ministry of Education, University, and\nResearch (Futuro in Ricerca 2012, Grant\nRBFR12F0BD to GG) and the University of Padova\n(Bando Giovani Ricercatori 2015 \u2018\u2018Assegno Senior,\u2019\u2019\ngrant n8 GRIC15QDDH to MD).We are very grateful\nto Ralf Engbert for his valuable suggestions on data\nanalysis and to Michela Veronesi for her assistance\nduring data collection.

Microsaccadic amplitude and\npeak velocity were positively correlated, r(4209) \u00bc\n0.464, p , 0.001, BF . 150. As for the microsaccadic\nrate, the only signi\ufb01cant comparison between low- and\nhigh-load conditions emerged in the 200\u2013400 ms time\nwindow (Mlow\u00bc1.4 Hz, SE\u00bc0.15,Mhigh\u00bc0.99 Hz, SE\n\u00bc 0.11, t(22)\u00bc 2.6, p\u00bc 0.016, d\u00bc 0.5, BF10\u00bc 3.3, two-\ntailed), while the other two comparisons were both\nnonsigni\ufb01cant (ts , 1, ps . 0.3, BF10s , 1, two-tailed).\nMicrosaccadic amplitude was analysed as well. Indeed,\nsince there is evidence that microsaccadic amplitudes\nincrease with task dif\ufb01culty (see Siegenthaler et al.,\n2014), the same pattern of results could be also\nexpected in a working memory load task. The analyses\nsupported this scenario. Mean microsaccadic amplitude\nwas calculated within the three time windows employed\nfor the microsaccadic rate analyses. Overall, micro-\nsaccadic amplitude was smaller in the low-load\ncondition than in the high-load condition, both in the\n200\u2013400 ms time window (Mlow \u00bc 0.2088, SE \u00bc 0.012,\nMhigh\u00bc0.38, SE\u00bc 0.025, t(22)\u00bc 4.89, p , 0.001 , d . 1,\nBF10 . 150, two-tailed), and in the other two time\nwindows (ts . 3.1, ps , 0.005, BF10s . 9, two-tailed).\nSimilar results emerged also considering microsaccades\nwith a maximum amplitude of 0.58, both in the 200\u2013400\nms time window (Mlow \u00bc 0.1968, SE \u00bc 0.009, Mhigh \u00bc\n0.2528, SE\u00bc 0.014, t(22)\u00bc 5.12, p , 0.001 , d . 1, BF10\n. 150, two-tailed) and in the other two time windows\n(ts . 2.45, ps , 0.023, BF10s . 2.5, two-tailed).\n2 As in Experiment 1, the same analyses were also\nperformed by considering microsaccades with a max-\nimum amplitude of 0.58.

The regulation of emotions may be conscious/overt or non-conscious/covert. Several authors have tried to identify different kind of regulatory strategies that we use in daily life to modify the magnitude and/or type of emotional experience or emotion-eliciting events [13].The ability to adaptively regulate emotions is crucial for healthy functioning. Both negative and positive emotions may be regulated. Over the years many authors have focused mostly on strategies used to influence and modify negative emotions. In fact, negative emotions and dysregulation of negative affect have been shown to be related to psychopathology [13,14]. Moreover, different theoretical models have highlighted different specific strategies that are adaptive or maladaptive, and the latter has been correlated with different type of disorders. Maladaptive strategies which are generally considered to be associated with negative outcome are: avoidance, rumination and suppression (namely the suppression of the emotional display or of the emotional experience), whereas adaptive strategies are problem solving, acceptance and reappraisal [13].It should be noted, that answering the question whether a strategy is adaptive or maladaptive is context-dependent [15] and new perspective theory [16] stated that flexibly adapting one\u2019s behavior across different stressor situations is equally if not more important than the ability to use any single positive strategy. Nonetheless, most of the extant scientific literature addressed the relationship between the use of maladaptive strategies evidencing that their use is associated to psychopathological disorders such as depression [17-20], anxiety, eating disorders [13,14] and other mental disorders [21]. Moreover, recent results suggest that difficulties in emotion regulation may be markers of cognitive impairment in other psychological diseases [22].Though it seems there is an obvious association between insomnia or poor sleep and difficulties in emotion regulation, it is still an area of research in considerable expansion, full of contradictory results and paucity of consistent empirical evidence. Although recent experimental research [23] studied altered emotion perception in individuals with insomnia disorder, studies investigating the ability to regulate emotion in patients with chronic insomnia are almost lacking. In this review a selection of recent empirical research will be presented, aiming to answer several questions and to highlight gaps and suggestions for future research and for treatment.AbstractRecent findings suggest that insomnia and emotion regulation are closely connected. Insomnia is widely associated with medical and psychiatric conditions as well as with impaired quality of life and emotional functioning. Additionally empirical evidence suggests that emotional dysregulation plays a crucial role in the onset and maintenance of psychopathological disorders. Although these seem to interact, very few studies investigated the relationship between disturbed sleep and problems in emotion regulation. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) has been demonstrated to be effective in comorbid insomnia. However, emotion regulation skills are not included in this intervention. After reviewing the recent findings of the literature, we aim to discuss future directions for the inclusion of emotion regulation training in the treatment of insomnia disorder. KeywordsInsomnia, Emotion regulation, Sleep, Emotions, TreatmentIntroductionA growing body of literature suggests that poor sleep or insomnia and emotion regulation are closely linked and there is a complex interplay between them [1]. Insomnia is a sleep disorder characterized by persistent difficulties in initiating, maintaining sleep or waking up too early in the morning or sleep that is chronically non-restorative or poor in quality. These difficulties are associated with negative daytime outcomes as fatigue, depression, changes in several cognitive functions such as alertness, attention, concentration, memory and executive functions [2,3]. Patients with insomnia sleep 25 min less than healthy good sleepers [4] and chronic insomnia (i.e. insomnia symptoms for at least 3 times per week over a period of at least 3 months) has negative outcomes on health [5,6], and quality of life [7]. Insomnia is also often associated with other mental disorders [8] and may be considered a risk factor for depression [9]. For these reasons DSM 5 [10] overcomes the distinction between primary and secondary insomnia identifying an \u201cinsomnia disorder\u201d that may or may not be in comorbidity with other disorders.Insomnia has also been associated with increased emotion regulation difficulties [11]. This effect could have important consequences for individuals healthy functioning as insomnia may affect mental health both directly and through the mediation of the emotional dysregulation. According to Gross [12], the terms \u2018emotion regulation\u2019 and \u2018emotion dysregulation\u2019 refer to processes by which \u2022 Page 2 of 5 \u2022Cerolini et al. J Sleep Disord Manag 2015, 1:1Does Emotional Experience Affect Sleep?In a controlled study and using polysomnography [24] it was found a reduction of sleep efficiency, total sleep time, percentage of REM sleep as well as an increase of sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset and slow wave sleep, after inducing the emotion of failure in a cognitive task in healthy adults. Schmindt et al. [25] found that pre-sleep self-reported emotion of regret was positively associated with the insomnia severity in erderly. More recently, a controlled study conducted by the same research group [25,26] found that the experimental induction of regret in healthy students increased sleep onset latency. In general, empirical research supports the idea that negative emotions experienced before bedtime impact sleep quality. The effect of positive emotions on sleep is under debate. According to Espie\u2019s theory [27] pre-sleep emotional activation of both negative and positive valence is supposed to disrupt sleep through an enhancement of emotional arousal. However, empirical evidence supporting this theory is still scarce whilst the opposite relationship has been sometimes reported. In a cross-sectional study, Steptoe et al. [28] found that positive emotions predicted a better sleep quality controlling for health and socioeconomic status and psychopathology. Wood et al. [29] found an association between the emotion of gratitude experienced before going to bed and a better sleep quality controlling for personality characteristics. In two weeks prospective study Kalmbach et al. [30] found that self-report positive emotions experienced during the day predicted a shorter sleep onset latency and a longer total sleep time at night.Does the Quality of Sleep Affect Emotional Experience and the Ability to Recognize Emotions?Several correlational and experimental studies have shown that whole-night sleep deprivation or sleep restriction across multiple nights (chronic sleep restriction) adversely influence adults\u2019 emotional functioning [31-33]. The experimental induction of sleep-deprivation increases negative affect and reduces positive affect [31,33,34]. A study by Tempesta et al. [35] investigated the effect of sleep deprivation on the emotional rating of standardized visual stimuli (pleasant, neutral and unpleasant stimuli) selected from the International Affective Pictures Stimuli (IAPS) [36]. Forty healthy participants, assigned to a deprivation group and a non-deprivation group, rated valence and arousal of the pictures. Their sleep was monitored using actigraphs. Both groups judged similarly pleasant and unpleasant the pictures, showing no significant effect of the sleep deprivation condition. Nevertheless, they judged neutral stimuli in a more negative way compared to the non-deprived group. Authors explain this finding according to the adaptive principle \u201cbetter safe than sorry\u201d [37], suggesting that sleep deprivation may exacerbate this tendency. They also found that the sleep deprived group showed higher negative mood than well-rested participants. Other studies investigated the effect of sleep deprivation on facial responsiveness to emotional stimuli. Facial emotional reaction has an important role in successful social interaction in every-day-life. Minkel et al. [38] found a reduction of facial emotional expressiveness in sleep deprived individuals while watching emotional film clips. Schwarz et al. [39] studied the effect of shortened night sleep on facial reactions to emotional stimuli using EMG task and rating their valence and arousal. Results showed slower facial muscular reactions to each type of emotional stimuli after sleep restriction but no difference in valence and arousal. Another interesting study by Talbot et al. [34] investigated the impact of sleep deprivation on the affective state in a sample of adolescents and adults. They measured their habitual sleep through sleep diaries and actigraphs for 5 consecutive nights, then they presented a sleep deprivation condition (2 consecutive nights) and a rested condition (order was counterbalanced). After each condition, they collected data using an Affective Functioning Battery, which included the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and the version for children (PANAS and PANAS-C), a worry generation and most threatening worry task and a catastrophizing task. They found that, according to their hypothesis, individuals reported less positive affects during the sleep deprived condition respect to the rested condition. In contrast, no significant difference was found in the negative affect between neither condition nor age group. These findings on adolescent sample are in line with the results of Dagys at al. [40] who found that adolescents after sleep deprivation reported less positive emotions and lower positivity ratios (the balance between positive and negative emotions using PANAS-C). Another study of Baum et al. [41] has to be mentioned to extend the literature on adolescent sleep deprivation. Their experimental design included fifty adolescents (ages 14-17) and used self-report, parents\u2019 report and objective data. A 3-weeks sleep manipulation protocol was used, assessing emotions after a week of baseline, 5 consecutive nights of sleep restriction (6.5 h per night allowed) and 5 consecutive nights of normal sleep condition (10 h per night allowed) randomly assigned and counterbalanced across participants. They monitored their sleep through an actigraph and self-report instruments. They found an increasing in negative effects. Participants rated themselves as significantly more tense/anxious, angry/hostile, confused, fatigued, and as less vigorous during the sleep restriction condition. Both parents and adolescents reports revealed greater oppositionality/irritability and poorer emotion regulation during sleep restriction condition compared to normal sleep condition. They found no cross-condition differences in depression or hyperactivity/impulsivity. A young adult\u2019s population was studied by Haack & Mullington [42]. The authors investigated the effect of sustained sleep restriction of the 50% of the normal sleep time for 12 days on emotional and physical well-being. They found a reduction of optimism-sociability (15%) and an amplification of bodily discomfort (3%) with ad increasing of stomach pain, back pain and generalized body pain.Taken together, results of the studies reviewed above allow us to conclude that poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation is associated to more negative emotional experience but just few studies investigated the daytime emotional experience in patients with insomnia. For instance, a study by Buysse et al. [43] using ecological momentary assessment, indicated that individuals with insomnia, when compared with good sleepers, reported higher negative mood and lower positive mood. Another study [44] using the same design for two weeks-period revealed that different indices of subjective sleep (e.g. total sleep time, sleep efficiency and time of awakenings) in individuals with insomnia were associated with measures of perceived daytime functioning including mood the following morning, compared to the good sleep group that showed no association.Is the Relationship between Quality of Sleep and Quality of the Emotional Experience Bidirectional?As aforementioned, sleep and emotion may be related through a bidirectional link [45]. According to the bidirectional hypothesis, daytime negative emotions are supposed to disrupt sleep and in turn, poor sleep may increase emotional experience the following day. However this bidirectional link has been only indirectly confirmed and to our knowledge only very few studies addressed it directly. To explore the bidirectional hypothesis of sleep and emotion, a recent study [46] used a 7 days prospective study with self-reported measures of sleep and emotions (PANAS). In the study, students were asked to complete a sleep diary and to evaluate their emotional experience every day in the afternoon. Results showed that people reporting poor sleep quality also referred to have more negative and less positive emotions during the day as compared to good sleepers. Similarly, participants who reported to have more positive and less negative emotions also reported better sleep quality. However, the results of the study did not support the bidirectional hypothesis: sleep diary completed in the morning predicted the emotional experience reported in the afternoon, whilst daytime emotions did not predict the sleep quality of the following night. Other studies using PANAS [47-49] support the hypothesis that poor sleep quality is linked to increased negative emotions and decreased positive emotions. Another recent study by Takano et al. [50] suggests the presence of a self-reinforcing cycle involving repetitive thoughts, mood and impaired sleep quality. They used a one-week sampling period with a mobile-phone-based experience sampling method (ESM) to collect \u2022 Page 3 of 5 \u2022Cerolini et al. J Sleep Disord Manag 2015, 1:1thoughts content and mood of participants eight times per day. Sleep parameters were measured with actigraphs. Results showed that repetitive thought was associated with longer sleep onset latency, impaired sleep efficiency and a reduction of total sleep time. They also found that impaired sleep efficiency was associated with decreased positive affect the subsequent morning and reduced positive mood was associated with increased repetitive thoughts during the day as in a vicious cycle.Insomnia, Poor Sleep and Emotion RegulationIn a pioneering study, Harvey [51] compared individuals with insomnia and good sleepers in the use of thought control strategies using the Thought Control Questionnaire for Insomnia (TCQ-I). The results showed that participants with insomnia used the strategies of suppression, reappraisal and worry significantly more than good sleepers. Ree et al. [52] elaborated a refined version of the questionnaire, named the Thought Control Questionnaire Insomnia Revised (TCQI-R) evaluating a bigger number of cognitive emotion regulation strategies. Comparing persons with insomnia and good sleepers, the authors found that the firsts used all the strategies of thought control more frequently than controls, expect for cognitive distraction, which was the only strategy associated with better sleep quality. In particular, aggressive suppression and worry showed to be associated with worse sleep quality. More recently, Nota & Coles [53] confirmed that rumination is cross-sectionally associated with short sleep duration. However, very few studies have investigated the relationship between insomnia symptoms and emotion regulation abilities. Racine and colleagues [54] found that short and long sleep duration (less or more than the population average sleep time, 6\u20138 hours) were associated with reduced ability of emotion regulation on a population of 523 black women. Women sleeping 6\u20138 hours seemed to be more able to regulate their daily lives emotions. The presence of Insomnia symptoms might mediate the association between emotion regulations and sleep duration. Another 3-years longitudinal study of Tavernier & Willoughby [55] on 942 university students, showed a significant bidirectional association between sleep problems and emotion regulation. That is, students who had more sleep problems also reported less positive social ties and in turn the latter predicted more sleep problems. Authors also found that problems in regulating emotions mediated the relationship between sleep disturbances and social ties. Recently, a study of Mauss et al. [56] found positive association between poor sleep and impaired emotion regulation ability. Particularly they investigated the effect of retrospective measures of sleep quality on a specific adaptive emotion regulation strategy: cognitive reappraisal (CRA), considered as the ability to cognitively reframe a particular emotional negative event in order to decrease its impact [57]. One hundred fifty-six participants completed self-report questionnaires and laboratory tasks. In an individual laboratory session, they first measured self-report sleep quality of the previous 24 h and of the whole week and CRA using a film clips task, following the procedures reported by Troy and colleagues [58]. Results showed positive association between subjective ratings of sleep quality and CRA. Specifically poor sleep quality of the past week was linked with decreased cognitive reappraisal ability, while poor sleep of the past 24h was marginally associated. The relationship between sleep quality and CRA was also statistically controlled for a large number of potential confounding variables (e.g. age, gender, mood and anxiety disorder symptoms, caffeine consumption), suggesting that it was not influenced by a third variable. In line with the hypothesis that poor sleep is associated with emotion regulation abilities another study of Velardin et al. [59] explored how sleep difficulties and sleep stability are related to cognitive control disengaging attention from negative emotional stimuli. Particularly they related this relationship with depressive symptoms over a 3-weeks period. First they found that a poor sleep quality during the 3 weeks period was associated with increased depressive symptoms when controlled for symptoms at baseline. Second, poor sleep quality predicted greater difficulties in disengaging attention and the latter consequentially predicted greater depressive symptoms. An experimental study of Vanderkerckhove et al. [60] tested whether different emotion regulation strategies might influence sleep physiology. Participants were instructed to use either a cognitive-analytical or an experiential emotion regulation strategy before polysomnographic assessment. Results showed that experiential approach was related with increased total sleep time and sleep efficiency index and decreased nocturnal awakenings although an increase of sleep onset latency was observed compared to cognitive-analytical approach. Instead, a recent cross-sectional study of Sandru & Voinescu [61] found that difficulties in regulating emotions predicted self-reported poor sleep quality. Results show that emotion regulation difficulties were also associated with the presence of dysfunctional beliefs about sleep.Evidence from neuroimaging studies seems to support the existence of the relationship between sleep quality and emotion regulation. The principal brain region involved in emotion regulation seems the prefrontal cortex (PFC), that plays an important role also in the cognitive control of emotions [62] and several studies suggest that the latter could be disrupted by disturbed sleep [63,64]. PFC has been shown to be sensible to sleep loss. Moreover, an experimental study by Yoo et al. [65] shows how participants who had been sleep deprived exhibited reduced functional connectivity between brain regions responsible for cognitive control (medial prefrontal areas) and emotional responses (amygdala) while viewing negative emotional pictures, compared to the control group. These findings are in line with results of studies that used chronic deprivation [66] and partial acute deprivation [67] supporting the association of these two main domains and supporting the role of emotion-regulatory control by prefrontal brain areas [62].Implications for TreatmentWhilst cognitive and behavioral consequences of poor sleep and insomnia have been studied in depth over the last decades, emotional experience have been widely ignored and the empirical findings in this field still need to be replicated and confirmed. The consequence of this is that CBI-I, the main non-pharmacological therapy for insomnia, is mostly based on behavioral and cognitive techniques. However, results summarized above suggest that CBT-I programs could benefit from the inclusion of specific techniques targeting emotions and emotion regulation skills. To this issue, several studies have already been conducted for assessing efficacy of programs that specifically address emotions in insomnia. Ong and colleagues published a group of studies evidencing that mindfulness protocols alone [68] or combined with the standard CBT-I program [69,70] are effective in reducing insomnia symptoms. The protocol used taught participants to respond to disturbed sleep with mindfulness skills rather than react automatically by increasing effort to rest. A systematic review by Winbush and colleagues [71] identified 7 studies before 2007 assessing efficacy of mindfulness and the same research group also published a paper in 2011 [72] confirming efficacy of this approach.In recent years, several authors proposed brief psychoeducational interventions focused specifically on improving emotional recognition and regulation. They applied these programs to Binge Eating Disorder (BED), for which, like for insomnia, a relationship has been established between severity of the symptoms and negative affect or emotion dysregulation. Efficacy of these programs in reducing BED episodes have been demonstrated [73-75]. Although these findings seem promising, no studies have applied these protocols to insomnia yet.Conclusions and Suggestions for Future DirectionsResults of the studies summarized in the present review confirm that emotion regulation may mediate the effect of insomnia symptoms on different psychosocial outcomes. The hypothesis that could be advanced is that sleep loss (either acute or chronic) may impair the ability to use functional or flexible emotion regulation strategies thus increasing negative mood which, in turn, may alter sleep in a vicious cycle that produces in the long run negative health outcomes. To our knowledge, no direct evidence supports this complex relationship \u2022 Page 4 of 5 \u2022Cerolini et al. J Sleep Disord Manag 2015, 1:1yet, with the exception of Tavernier & Willoughby\u2019s study [55]. Although the distinction between daytime and nighttime processes seems forced, most of the studies reviewed above support most of the bivariate relationships within this complex hypothesis namely that: negative emotions impair sleep; sleep deprivation increases negative emotions and reduces positive emotions; sleep deprivation impairs the use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies and impaired emotion regulation abilities is associated with poor sleep; if people are trained to use adaptive emotion regulation strategies (like, for instance, acceptance of mindfulness) insomnia symptoms can be reduced.Speculating about the neurophysiological mechanisms that link bidirectionally insomnia and emotion dysregulation, sleep instability seems a good candidate. Current research indicates increased instability of both NREM [76] and REM Sleep [77] as crucial neurophysiological machanisms in insomnia. The second is particularly relevant for the line of reasoning followed in the present review. According to the REM instability hypothesis, this brain state requires a fine balance between arousing and de-arousing brain mechanisms. For this reason it may be frequently interrupted by a cognitive activity related to pre-sleep arousing concerns. The chronic fragmentation of REM sleep might lead to dysfunctions in the emotional neural networks, including limbic and paralimbic areas that are specifically activated during REM sleep. This hypothesis would also partially explain the emotion regulation problems of persons with insomnia. As evidenced by Gujar at al. [78], REM sleep plays an important role in the maintenance of effective processes of emotion categorization during the day. More specifically, using a face recognition task the authors found that sleep loss amplified reactivity to negative emotions while a daily nap reversed this effect and enhanced the impact of positive stimuli. Based on these results the authors concluded that REM sleep may be necessary for the optimal homeostasis of emotional brain regulation.It should be outlined, however, that most of the literature reviewed in the present paper shows the effects of sleep deprivation on emotional experience. However, sleep deprivation is not an \u201cexperimental model\u201d of insomnia as the chronic sleep deprivation that characterizes insomnia disorder may be associated to adjustment processes that do not take place in the acute manipulation of sleep. Few studies evaluated the association between habitual poor sleep or habitual good sleep and emotional experience or emotion regulation suggesting that poor sleep is related to increased negative or reduced positive emotions. Again, poor sleep is not exactly the same as insomnia. Finally, the emotion regulation training proposed for BED has never been applied to insomnia. For these reasons, future research should address these issues considering patients with chronic insomnia.References1.

Introduction\nIn Denmark, the potential for further conversion to\norganic farming in the next 8\u201310 years has been\nestimated as 15% of the cultivated area (Christensen &\nFrandsen, 2001). Previous projections have estimated a\npotential of 30% conversion in 10 years (Action Plan II,\n1999). Most recently there has been a decline in the total\norganically farmed area in Denmark. Such discrepancies\nindicate that the premises on which these projections are\nbased do not fully capture the factors that determine the\nrate of conversion. The deliberations of farmers to\nconvert to organic farming range from pure production\nsystem considerations to conditions in the market\n(Christensen & Frandsen, 2001). By focusing on the\nproduction system, there is aneed to get abetter\nunderstanding of the importance of the factors that\ndetermine the conversion rate and the economics of\norganic farming. The required increased knowledge on\nthese factors include type of farm, labour situation and\neconomic constraints.\nOrganic farming is generally considered more labour\nintensive than conventional farming, as it is assumed\nthat chemical inputs are substituted by factors, such as\nincreased management knowledge, new practices and\ntechniques, capital and labour (Padel & Lampkin, 1994).\nHowever, the overall effect on labour and machinery\nusage when carrying out a transition from conventional\nto organic farming is dif\ufb01cult to predict. Most studies\nonly provide aggregated data, even though labour and\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n1537-5110/$30.00 127 r 2005 Silsoe Research Institute. All rights reserved\nPublished by Elsevier Ltdmachinery demand depend, in a complex way, on the\ntype of production and different farm-speci\ufb01c factors\nsuch as crop selection, rotation systems, degree of\nmechanisation and degree of specialisation. The existing\nliterature offers little detailed information about the use\nof evaluation tools capable of quantifying the labour\nand machinery demand at various farm levels as a\nfunction of internal and external organic farming\nconditions.\nStudies of the labour and machinery usage in the\ntransition from conventional to organic farming have\ngenerally assumed a signi\ufb01cant increase in the labour\ndemand and capital requirements (MacRae et al., 1990;\nDubgaard, 1994; Klemola, 1997; Rapp, 1998). The\nincrease in labour requirement has been assessed as\nranging from 15 to 70% in plant production systems,\ndue to, for example, more rotational crops, increased\nmechanical weed control and increased crop monitoring\n(MacRae et al., 1990). Limitations in the availability,\nquality and affordability of labour forces the organic\nfarmer to discard the use of, for example, sugar beet in\nthe rotation plan (Tersb\u00f8l et al., 2001). As aconse-\nquence, the farmer tends to adapt to the labour situation\nin a way that might not ful\ufb01l the biological demands of\nthe nutrient cycle on the farm. The introduction of\ninnovative technologies to reduce labour usage is seen as\na way of obtaining more biological ful\ufb01lling crop\nrotations in organic farming.\nWith regard to organic vegetables, Danish growers\nspend 100\u2013300hha\n 1 on hand-weeding onions and\ncarrots (Ascard, 1990; Melander & Rasmussen, 2001)\nand a time allocation of up to 500hha\n 1 is necessary\nunder particularly weedy conditions. This commitment\nis \ufb01nancially demanding for organic growers, not only in\nterms of direct labour costs, but also in terms of the\namount of time consumed for this single task, consider-\ning all the other urgent tasks necessary during the\ngrowing season. Furthermore, it is dif\ufb01cult to acquire\nsuf\ufb01cient local labour to carry out the hand weeding.\nSaunders et al. (1997) and Dabbert (2001) emphasise\nthat there is a lack of research data on \u2018real\u2019 farm system\nperformance involving an identi\ufb01cation and quanti\ufb01ca-\ntion of the technical constraints such as labour and\nmachinery inputs. Also, the professional management\nprinciples of conventional farming are increasingly\nbeing adopted by organic farmers. This creates a need\nfor acomprehensive knowledge ba se for the qua nti\ufb01ca -\ntion and evaluation of inputs of labour/technology\nresources in aholistic perspective ( Tzilivakis & Lewis,\n2001). The role of technology and knowledge is\nimportant, including the evaluation of the context of\nlabour data as related to capital and farm type.\nThe objective of this study is to design and test farm\nscenarios representing possible organic farming enter-\nprises based on milk, pig and plant production.\nFollowing the scenario construction, an integrated\napproach involving the determination of the technical\nproduction prerequisites, the establishment of labour\nbudgeting and the derivation of labour pro\ufb01les is\ninvoked. The currently available knowledge base for\noperational analyses is supplemented with acquired\nlabour data on managerial tasks and additional labour\ndata on outdoor pig production. Also included is an\nimpact analysis and feasibility study of introducing\ninnovative technologies into the organic production\nsystem.\nThis approach demonstrates the feasibility of bringing\noperational models and cost estimations to bear on the\nevaluation and documentation of labour and machinery\ninputs in organic farm systems. If the image of organic\nfarming is to be promoted to meet consumers\u2019 expecta-\ntions for agood working environment, documenta tion\nof the conditions relating to the working environment\nmust be available.\n2. Methodology\n2.1. Farm scenarios\nA preliminary analysis forms the basis for the design\nof organic farm scenarios. Scenario planning involves\ncombining factual data and expert evidence to create\nreasonable and credible scenarios envisioning possible\nfuture outcomes (Miller & Waller, 2003; van der\nSchilden, 2003). Participants in the scenario construc-\ntion included research experts and agricultural advisors\ncapable of providing insight and perspective on the\npossible future of organic farming, while at the same\ntime being aware of the current trends and key elements\nde\ufb01ning the organic farming environment. Through\nthis interactive process, a technical and biological\ndescription of anumber of model fa rms representing\ndifferent organic production systems (plant, cattle, pigs,\nmixed vegetables) was elaborated and the technical\nproduction characteristics detailed in Nielsen et al.\n(2003). The description involved organic farm types,\nwhich are plausible and internally consistent in terms of\nlogically following what is currently known and\nexpected in the near future (Account Statistics, 2001).\nTable 1 contains an overview of key production\ncharacteristics of the selected farm scenarios: four\nalternative cropping plans, P0, P1, P2 and P3; three\nmilk production scenarios, M1, M2 and M3; and one\npig production system, S1. Also, farm scenario P1 is\nused as the basis for simulation with band steaming\n(P1\u2013BS) and robotic weeding (P1\u2013RW).\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nC.G. S\u00d8RENSEN ET AL. 1282.2. On-farm analyses\nEmpirical studies on managerial ef\ufb01ciency are scarce\n(Trip et al., 2002). In terms of allocating time and labour\nto the management of the technical and biological\nprocesses in agriculture, previous attempts have often\nincluded an arbitrary assessment of a particular addition\nto the manual labour input (Nielsen & S\u00f8rensen, 1993;\nAchten, 1997; S\u00f8rensen et al., 2003). The data collection\nprotocol for the managerial tasks in this study included\nafa rm survey on 18 pre-selected groups of respondents\ndivided evenly between organic crop, dairy and pig\nproduction. The surveys included targeted question-\nnaires administered by an experienced researcher during\neach interview. The questionnaires included both closed\nand open-ended questions and followed established\nguidelines for surveys (Fink & Kosecoff, 1998). Efforts\nwere made to avoid any bias in the process of\ninterviewing farmers by introducing standardised lists\nof options to be answered. The results from the surveys\nallowed for the allocation of the labour requirements for\ntasks, such as production management in general,\nprofessional advancement, monitoring in the animal\nhouses and the \ufb01elds.\nA survey of six organic pig farmers was conducted to\ndetermine the daily and periodic labour requirements\nfor outdoor pig production.\nThe sampling method in both surveys was a\ncombination of methods based on the assessments from\nagricultural advisers and the advantage of the respon-\ndent\u2019s ability to identify the population under study.\nThis non-random method is considered feasible in terms\nof the main objective being a pilot study engaged in an\nexploratory analysis (Lohr, 1999).\n2.3. Analytical and modelling procedures\nBased on the information in Table 1, the model \u00d8-\nPLAN (Tvedegaard, 2002) was used to quantify a\nnumber of prerequisites constituting the basis for the\nsubsequent operational analyses. This dynamic planning\nmodel evaluates the economic consequences during\nconversion to organic farming as a function of the\nproduction technical relations and prevailing organic\nprovisions. By using selected parts of the model, many\nprerequisites including crop plans, fertiliser plans for\nanimal manure, crop yields, feed production and feed\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nTable 1\nFarm scenario description (adapted from Nielsen et al., 2003)\nFarm scenario\u0001\nP0 P1\ny P2 P3 M1 M2 M3 S1\nCrops, ha 10\nBarley/undersown 10 10 20 25 10\nSpring barley\nRye grass 05 05\nGrass clover 05 05 60 75 60\nFallow grass clover 10\nOats/undersown 10 10 05 10\nSugar beet 04\nCarrots 01\nPeas 10 10 05\nTriticale/catch crop 10 10\nPotatoes 10 05 10\nLucerne 26\nFallow grass 04\nWinter wheat 15\nSpring wheat 25\nMaize for silage 10 20 10\nBarley/peas/whole crop 15 10 20 25 30\nLupin 10 10\nAnimals, number\nCows 10\nz 75 110 93\nSows 70\n\u0001\u2018P\u2019, \u2018M\u2019 and \u2018S\u2019 indicate arable, dairy, and pig producing scenarios, respectively.\nyFarm scenario P1 is used as the basis for simulation with band-steaming (P1\u2013BS) or robotic weeding (P1\u2013RW).\nzAdditional, farm scenario P3 include 10 suckler cows and rearing as part of representing an versatile farm.\nORGANIC FARMING SCENARIOS 129plans, individual crop treatments and execution time for\ntreatments were derived (Fig. 1). In addition, the\nmachinery complement was selected and the capacity\nof individual machinery items was determined based on\na requirement assessment ful\ufb01lling average timeliness\nthresholds as speci\ufb01ed by S\u00f8gaard and S\u00f8rensen (2004).\nUpon quanti\ufb01cation of all prerequisites, the technical\noperational analyses of expected labour requirements\nand machine performance were carried out using\nthe generalised operations model DRIFT (Nielsen &\nS\u00f8rensen, 1993; Achten, 1997) supplemented with\nmodules for speci\ufb01c operations (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2003;\nS\u00f8rensen, 2003). These models enable the evaluation of\noperational performance to be adjusted to farm-speci\ufb01c\nconditions such as \ufb01eld size and shape, machinery\ncapacity and transport distance. Speci\ufb01cally, the labour\nrequirement for outdoor pig production was based on\ngeneralised data derived from a targeted study of six\npilot farms (Nielsen et al., 2003). The model estimates\ndetailed labour and machinery demands and evaluates\nthe scheduling of the operations to be performed. The\nlabour requirement may be estimated for an operation,\naspeci\ufb01c enterprise, or the whole fa rm, given techni-\ncal\u2013biological perquisites such as machinery system,\nmachinery size, \ufb01eld size, crop yield and with the\nintention of only identifying system-related differences.\nAccording to Nielsen and S\u00f8rensen (1993), an arbitrary\naddition covering the management tasks is included in\nthe total labour requirement. This addition amounts\nto 15 7% of the direct operational work load (see\nSection 4.1).\nThe operational technical evaluation of the model\nfarms includes both traditional working methods and\ninnovative technologies such as band steaming and\nrobotic weeding. The labour input, performance data\nand relevant economic parameters for these technologies\nare based on preliminary test data and expert assess-\nments. These data form the basis for analysing the costs\nand bene\ufb01ts. The economic consequences of implement-\ning innovative technologies have been calculated using\nconventional methods for estimating depreciation,\ninterest and maintenance of machinery (Madsen,\n2003). The costs were distributed over a10-yea r-lifetime\nas well as over the number of hectares being treated by\nthe machinery. A supplemental notion in terms of the\nmaximum acquisition value (MAV) is also used to assign\npro\ufb01tability, i.e. the capital amount that may be\ninvested in the new technology to achieve the same net\nresult as with the traditional technology.\n3. Introduction of innovative technologies\nThe continued development of organic farming\nrequires that innovative technologies are introduced in\norder to ful\ufb01l the perceived need for increased profes-\nsionalism, specialisation and use of rational production\nmethods (Christensen & Frandsen, 2001). The technol-\nogies for the organic sector need to be integrated and\nmust conform to a number of sustainability factors\ninstead of simply being redesigned conventional ma-\nchinery (Hagras et al., 2002). Reluctance to adopt novel\ntechnologies in organic farming requires special con-\nsideration (Bond & Grundy, 2001). Assuming full\ntechnology acceptance, two examples of technology\nadoption are envisaged, focusing on labour-intensive\nareas of organic production such as the substitution of\nmanual weeding with mechanical weeding.\n3.1. Band steaming for intra-row weed control\nA new prototype of an integrated machinery system\nfor weeding, which involves band steaming for intra-row\nweed control, has been developed (Melander et al.,\n2004). The soil is thermally treated in a narrow\nbandwidth of 8cm around the crop rows at a depth of\n5cm prior to crop establishment in order to reduce weed\nseedling emergence. The subsequent sowing is carried\nout automatically following a track pre-set by the\nbandsteamer. The control of inter-row weeds is carried\nout by means of traditional hoeing. The system is\nintended to increase the yield of organically grown row\ncrops such as outdoor vegetables, maize and sugar/\nfodder beet. Table 2 outlines the operational parameters\nfor the system divided into two machinery sizes.\n3.2. Robotic weeding\nThe ultimate objective of robotic weeding is to reduce\nthe manual labour requirement for organic vegetables\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nMachinery\nselection\nOperational\nLabour input\nMachinery input\nLabour profile\nBiological\nproduction\nprerequisites:\nanalyses and\nmodelling\n- crop plans\n- fertiliser plans\n- yields\n- feeding plans\n- crop treatments\n- timing of crop\ntreatments\nFig. 1.

Current prototype technologies are based on a\nsmall autonomous vehicle, equipped with vision systems\nfor precision guidance and for plant recognition, as well\nas active tools for weed removal ( ( Astrand & Baerveldt,\n2002). In some cases, the technology requires that the\npositions of the individual seeds are logged prior to the\nweeding during sowing, as opposed to pure sensing of\nthe target crop and weeds (Blasco et al., 2002). This\napproach enables the weeding robot to broadly recover\nthe plant positions, while the precise position is retrieved\nby using computer vision, enabling weed removal close\nto the crop plant. Weeding between the rows is done\nusing traditional hoeing, with or without automatic\nguidance (Tillett et al., 2002).\nThe operational capability of the weeding robot is\nbased on experiences from the development of an\nautonomous platform (Bak & Jacobsen, 2004; S\u00f8rensen\net al., 2002) for monitoring in-\ufb01eld weeds as the basis for\nweed mapping, displaying the intensity and types of\nweeds distributed throughout the \ufb01eld. Based on an\nexpected lower velocity of the weeding robot than when\nrunning in monitoring mode and experiences from the\ndevelopment of a weeding machine for maize (Griepen-\ntrog & S\u00f8gaard, 2003), the operational performance\ndata shown in Table 3 were derived.\nRecent research (Terawaki et al., 2003) indicates that\nthe prerequisites with respect to velocity, and thereby\narea capacity, might be lower than the data presented in\nTable 3. The economic consequences of such adevia tion\nin capacity are discussed in Section 4.3.\n4. Results and discussion\n4.1. Labour and machinery input\nThe labour demand was estimated for each of the\nfarm scenarios (Table 4). The labour requirement is\nrelatively high for the scenario P0. The considerable\ninput of labour is caused by the growing of potatoes on\n17% of the total adjoining area. In the case of farm\nscenario P1, potatoes, sugar beet, and carrots are grown\non 8 3%, 6 7% and 1 7% of the area, respectively. The\nintroduction of sugar beet and carrots to P1 increases\nthe labour demand by 53% compared with P0 due to the\nmanual weeding and the cleaning and sorting of the\ncarrots. Maintaining the altered crop plan and introdu-\ncing robotic weeding and band steaming for weed\nmanagement in sugar beet reduces the labour demand\nby 85% and 83%, respectively. The reduction in labour\ndemand for carrots equals 60% for both technologies,\nbecause much manual labour must still be devoted to\nthe cleaning and sorting of the carrots.\nAs observed, the amount of labour input differs\nconsiderably between the different production con\ufb01g-\nurations within the plant production system, and the\nallocation of the labour input during the year is also\naffected. Figure 2 shows the labour pro\ufb01les for the four\nfarm scenarios (P0, P1, P1\u2013RW and P1\u2013BS). The\nscenario P1 demonstrates a high labour demand for\nmanual weeding from week 22 to week 27 in contrast to\nthe labour demand for P1\u2013RW and P1\u2013BS. In general,\nthe farm scenarios P0, P1\u2013RW and P1\u2013BS re\ufb02ect the\nseasonal pattern of work throughout the spring and\nautumn.\nIn the case of farm scenario P2, the labour require-\nment is relatively low, caused by the fact that 50% of the\narea is cropped with lucerne and the rest is cropped with\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nTable 2\nOperational parameters and the price of a band steamer\n(adapted from Dyring, 2002)\nGenerator power\u0001\n726kW 1493kW\nCapacity, hah\n 1 0 20  4\nBandwidth, cm 8 8\nVelocity, kmh\n 1 1 12  2\nTurning time, service time, etc., % 10 10\nInvestment, h\ny 40323 56152\n\u0001The generator power is the rated output from the commercial\navailable steam generators.\nyCurrency conversion: 100 h \u00bc 744 DKK.\nTable 3\nExpected performance data and price for a weeding robot\nPerformance Sugar beet Maize\nVelocity, ms\n 1 0 50 1 00\nField ef\ufb01ciency\u0001, % 80 80\nWorking width, cm (2 rows) 100 150\nArea capacity\ny,h ah\n 1 0 18 (net 0 23) 0 54 (net 0 68)\nService time\nz, % 15 15\nInvestment\ny, h 26882\n*,yField ef\ufb01ciency and area capacity are estimated by simulating the\ndriving pa ttern on a2 ha\ufb01eld (100 by 200m) using agenera lised\noperation model (Nielsen & S\u00f8rensen, 1993)\nzThe service time includes labour allocated to maintain the robot\noperational analogous to traditional \ufb01eld operation (Nielsen &\nS\u00f8rensen, 1993).\nyThe expected initial price of the weeding robot is assessed by\ncombining the concepts of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) with the\nneed for additional subsystems and sensors to achieve the functionality\nof the perceived weeding robot (Garcia-Alegre et al., 2001; Blackmore\net al., 2002).\nORGANIC FARMING SCENARIOS 131cereals and fallow land. Since silo maize is included for\nscenario P3, supplemental labour input for weeding is\nrequired, causing a relatively high input of labour\ndespite cropping mainly with cereals.\nThe yearly labour input for the arable farm scenarios\nranges between 0 2 and 0 9 of the annual one-person\nwork of 1665h. The 60ha arable farm scenarios are only\ncapable of supplying part-time employment. In order to\nsustain a full-time employment more labour-intensive,\nand probably more pro\ufb01table, crops are required.\nThe labour demand in the \ufb01eld is relatively low for the\nmilk production scenarios, mainly because of the\nrelatively large areas of grassland used for grazing and\nsilage. No labour-intensive crops such as fodder beet are\ngrown. The labour demand is fractionally higher at the\npig farm, caused by the growing of silo maize and\nlupines and additional catch crops. The labour demand\nper livestock units (LU) in the livestock production\nsystems ranges from 19 4t o3 9  6 man hours, which\nprovides the possibility of employing outside help and\nthereby makes it easier to achieve harmony in the\noverall workload.\nThe operations performed by a contractor in the\nvarious scenarios range from 7 to 65% of the overall\n\ufb01eld work (Table 5). The use of acontra ctor is more\nwidely adopted in the milk production scenarios, where\nspecialised machinery often is needed for manure\nhandling, silage making, combine harvesting and other\ntasks with only seasonal utilisation. The high-cost\noperations allocated to contractors is evident from a\ncomparison of the share of \ufb01eld work performed by\ncontractors and total cost, since the share of total cost\nexceeds the share of \ufb01eld work.\n4.2. Targeted model validation\nThe results of the empirical studies on the managerial\nef\ufb01ciency for different organic production types indi-\ncated that the average management efforts ranged from\n13 7t o1 9  0% of the total labour input (Fig. 3) with a\ngross average of 15 7%. Statistical testing of the\nhypothesis that the management efforts for the different\nproduction systems are equal cannot be rejected\n\u00f0P40 05\u00de: Based on these \ufb01ndings, the gross average\nvalue of 15 7% is used in the labour input estimations.\n4.3. Band steaming for intra-row weed control\nThe considerable reduction in labour demand con-\ntributes to asigni\ufb01ca nt improvement of the economic\noutcome. If the system is assumed to be a part of the\nmachinery complement for farm scenario P1\u2013BS, a\ndecrease in gross margin by 270hha\n 1 is expected, while\nan increase of 986hha\n 1 can be obtained if a contractor\ncarries out the operation (Table 6). In the case of a\ncontractor performing the operation the annual operat-\ning hours are 135h, while the actual utilisation for the\nfarm scenario P1\u2013BS only amounts to 12 5hyr\n 1. The\npotential operating hours of 135hyr\n 1 are based on\nDanish weather conditions, where during the seeding\nseason an operational window of 15 days of 12 each and\na workability of 75% is expected in a normal year\n(Madsen, 2003).\nA critical prerequisite with respect to the improved\npro\ufb01tability is the ef\ufb01ciency with which the band\nsteaming is able to replace manual weeding.

A better utilisation of the capacity\ncan be obtained if a contractor or a cooperative of\norganic farmers carries out the operation as more\npotential operating hours are utilised. In an average\nyear, 20 days of acceptable weather conditions (of which\n75% are workable) are expected, and if the weeding\nrobot is able to operate for 12\u201320hday\n 1, respectively,\ndepending on the need for daylight, 180\u2013300hyr\n 1 are\navailable. The costs are reduced by 79 and 85%\ncompared with manual weeding.\nThe pro\ufb01tability improvements shown in Table 7 are\nbased on a reduction of manual weeding by 100%.\nHowever, N\u00f8rremark and Griepentrog (2004) and\nLamm et al. (2002) indicate that the weeding ef\ufb01ciency\nwould presumably be lower and could easily be reduced\nby 20\u201325%. If an ef\ufb01ciency of 75% is assumed, the cost\nreduction is no longer around 80% but is reduced to\n47\u201356% dependent on the degree of utilisation. Despite\nthis reduction, the technology is still pro\ufb01table to\nimplement regardless of ownership. In an economic\nsetting, the uncertainty of the purchase price is expected\nto signi\ufb01cantly in\ufb02uence the pro\ufb01tability. Focusing on\nthe uncertainty of costs and bene\ufb01ts by implementing\nrobotic weeding, the weeding ef\ufb01ciency, weed intensity,\npurchase price of the machinery, utilisation and area\ncapacity are key parameters. A reduction in the lifetime\nfrom 10 to 6 yr would change the total cost reduction\nfrom around 80 to 67%. In Fig. 4, the relationship\nbetween weeding ef\ufb01ciency and maximum acquisition\nvalue of the technology is illustrated at different levels of\nweed intensity and utilisation. The maintenance cost per\nhour is calculated as 0 04 pct of the acquisition value.\nFrom Fig. 4 it can be seen that, even at a low level of\nweed intensity and utilisation, the maximum acquisition\nvalue for a rational organic farmer would be just under\nh 40000.

If, on the other hand,\nthe actually obtained working velocity is lower than\nexpected, which might be the case under certain\ncircumstances as indicated by Terawaki et al. (2003),a\nhigher utilisation and weeding ef\ufb01ciency is required to\npay off the expected investment cost.\n5. Conclusion\nDetailed operational analyses of organic farm scenar-\nios formed the basis for predicting the labour and\nmachinery input for all work operations in the \ufb01eld and\nthe animal houses, selection of machinery types and the\nestimation of machinery sizes. The results show that the\nlabour demand ranges from 6 1t o2 5  3hha\n 1 for\n\ufb01eldwork and from 19 4t o3 9  6h per livestock unit\nfor work in the animal houses.\nThe introduction of sugar beet and carrots into a\nspeci\ufb01c crop plan increases the labour demand by 53%,\nbecause of the manual weeding and the cleaning and\nsorting of the carrots. By maintaining an altered crop\nplan and introducing the new technologies such as\nrobotic weeding and band steaming for weed manage-\nment, the labour demand is reduced by 85 and 83%,\nrespectively, for sugar beet production, and 60% when\ngrowing carrots.\nThe signi\ufb01cant reduction in labour demand reduces\nthe cost of growing carrots and sugar beet considerably.\nAssuming that the technologies are highly utilised, a\ngain in pro\ufb01tability of about 72\u201385% can be obtained. If\nthe machinery utilisation is low (5ha), the cost is\nreduced by 46% and increased by 20% in the case of\nrobotic weeding and band steaming, respectively.\nThe cost reduction is 47\u201356% for both technologies if\na weeding ef\ufb01ciency of only 75% is achieved instead of\n100%, assuming high utilisation. Apart from the\nweeding ef\ufb01ciency and the level of utilisation, the\npro\ufb01tability of both technologies is sensitive to weed\nintensity and the initial price in the case of robotic\nweeding. Assuming aweeding ef\ufb01ciency of 75%, yea rly\nuse of 180h and low weed intensity, a maximum\nacquisition value of under h 40000 is estimated for the\nrobotic weeding technology. In general, the analysis of\nthe economic consequences of implementing the new\ntechnologies indicates that robotic weeding is preferable\nto the band steamer if uncertainty is neglected. There is\nmore uncertainty related to robotic weeding, but even in\nthe worst case the technology is still pro\ufb01table.\nSince the selected new technologies only reduce the\ninputs of labour and cost when growing beet and\nvegetables, a limited part of the organic sector is\naffected. As a consequence, the devised limited applica-\ntion of innovative technologies is not likely to cause a\nbreakthrough in lowering of the production costs in the\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nWeeding efficiency, %\n20 40 60 80 100\nM\na\nx\ni\nm\nu\nm\n \na\nc\nq\nu\ni\ns\ni\nt\ni\no\nn\n \nv\na\nl\nu\ne\n,\n0\n20000\n40000\n60000\n80000\n100000\n120000\n140000\n160000\nFig. 4.

While the inhibition component executive \nprocess appears to be unaffected by ecstasy use, it is unclear whether this is true of heavy \nusers under conditions of high demand. Tasks loading on the updating component \nexecutive process have been shown to be adversely affected by ecstasy use. However, it \nremains unclear whether the deficits observed reflect the executive aspects of the tasks \nand whether they are domain general in nature affecting both verbal and visuo-spatial \nupdating. Fourteen heavy ecstasy users, 39 light ecstasy users and 28 non users were \ntested on tasks loading on the inhibition executive process (random letter generation) and \nthe updating component process (letter updating, visuo-spatial updating and computation \nspan). Heavy users were not impaired in random letter generation even under conditions \nof high demand. Ecstasy related deficits were observed on all updating tasks. These \ndeficits remained statistically significant following controls for various aspects of \ncannabis use. It was concluded that the inhibition component executive process is \nunaffected by ecstasy use even among heavy users. By way of contrast, the updating \ncomponent process appears to be impaired in ecstasy users with the deficit apparently \ndomain general in nature. \n \nKeywords: ecstasy (MDMA), inhibition, updating, executive, random generation, \nvisuo-spatial.  \nJohn E Fisk \n3 \nThere is cause to believe that among the many illicit drugs commonly in use, ecstasy in \nparticular causes long term impairment to cognitive processes through its effects on the \nserotonin system (Gouzoulis-Mayfrank & Daumann 2006; Morgan, 2000; Reneman et al \n2006).  Morgan (2000, page 234) has noted that \u2018it has been proposed that it [serotonin] \nmay play an orchestrating role in cognition\u2019. More specifically, the serotonin system is \nbelieved to underpin working memory processes through its modulation of the \ndopaminergic systems that support prefrontal executive processes (Luciana, Collins, & \nDepue, 1998; Robbins 2000).  \nRecent investigations of executive functioning suggest that the central executive \nis fractionated. For example, Miyake et al. (2000) studied the separability of three \nsupposed executive functions: mental set shifting (\u201cshifting\u201d), information updating and \nmonitoring (\u201cupdating\u201d), and inhibition of pre-potent responses (\u201cinhibition\u201d). Structural \nequation modelling revealed that the three executive functions were clearly separate and \nappeared to contribute differentially to performance on higher level tasks that are known \nto be reliant on prefrontal cortical resources. For example, the Wisconsin Cart  Sort Task \n(WCST) was linked to the shifting component, the Tower of Hanoi to the inhibition \ncomponent, random number generation to both the inhibition and updating components, \nand operation span to the updating component.  \nUsing factor analysis, Fisk and Sharp (2004) provided further support for Miyake \net al\u2019s model, finding that reading span and computation span (analogous to Miyake et \nal\u2019s operation span task), letter updating (Morris & Jones, 1990) and a visuo-spatial serial \nrecall task (Brooks, 1967) all loaded on a single factor corresponding to Miyake et al\u2019s \nupdating executive process. Aspects of random letter generation loaded on a separate \nJohn E Fisk \n4 \nfactor corresponding to Miyake et al\u2019s inhibition executive process, while WCST \nmeasures loaded on a third factor (equivalent to Miyake et al\u2019s switching executive \nprocess). Additionally, a fourth factor emerged which Fisk and Sharp termed access to \nlong-term memory and on which verbal fluency tasks loaded. \nPrevious research from our laboratory (Fisk et al, 2004; Montgomery et al, 2005; \nWareing et al 2004) utilising Miyake et al\u2019s conceptual framework, revealed ecstasy-\nrelated deficits in memory updating (computation span and letter updating), and access to \nlong-term memory (verbal fluency). No differences were observed on tasks assessing the \nswitching (the plus-minus and number letter task) and inhibition (random letter \ngeneration) component processes. However inconsistencies in this area of research have \nemerged. From our own laboratory, while Wareing, et al (2000) found ecstasy users to be \nimpaired in random letter generation, we have failed to obtain this outcome in subsequent \nstudies (Fisk, et al, 2004; Montgomery, et al, 2005).  Similarly the ecstasy-related deficits \nin relation to the updating executive component process that emerged from our own \nresearch (Montgomery et al, 2005) have not have been replicated by Dafters (2005) using \nthe keeping track task. \nClearly these inconsistencies require explanation and warrant further research.  \nWareing et al\u2019s (2000) participants had an atypically high estimated lifetime ecstasy dose \nexceeding 1000 tablets and the random letter generation task used, restricted participants \nto producing only consonants. In our later study (Fisk et al, 2004) those we tested had an \nappreciably lower lifetime exposure to the drug and we administered the original version \nof the task (Baddeley 1966) in which any letter of the alphabet may be produced. It is \npossible therefore that ecstasy might impair the inhibition component process but only at \nJohn E Fisk \n5 \nhigh does and only when the processing load is substantial. To resolve this ambiguity, it \nwould be desirable to repeat the consonants only random generation task on a group of \nhigh dosage users in order to replicate our previous findings. \nQuestions have also emerged concerning our previous results which demonstrated \necstasy-related updating component executive deficits. First at six letters, the \nmaintenance element of the updating task exceeded the letter span of the majority of \nparticipants that we tested. Consequently many participants may have adopted a free \nrecall recency based strategy negating the need for updating (Collette et al, 2006; Smith-\nSpark et al, 2003). It would be desirable to repeat our original experiment ensuring that \nthe maintenance component of the task does not exceed the letter span of our participants. \nSecond, we have recently demonstrated ecstasy-related deficits in visuo-spatial working \nmemory tasks (Wareing et al, 2004; 2005) although it is unclear which executive \ncomponent processes may be implicated in this regard. Recent conceptualisations of \nexecutive function tasks suggest the processing component of these is domain general \n(e.g., Bayliss et al 2003; Kane et al , 2004). If the updating component does reflect some \ndomain general process it would be expected that the impairments that we have observed \nin verbal updating would also manifested in visuo-spatial updating . \n \nMethod \n \nDesign and Analysis.  \nFor the random letter generation task, a mixed design was used with rate of letter \ngeneration (with three levels; 4 seconds, 2 seconds, and 1 second)) within participants \nJohn E Fisk \n6 \nand ecstasy users group (with three levels; heavy, light, and nonuser) between \nparticipants. Dependent variables were the number of alphabetically ordered pairs, \nnumber of repeated pairs, redundancy, and the number of vowel intrusions. With regard \nto the updating executive component tasks, verbal and spatial updating, and the \ncomputation span task, a multivariate design was used with user group (3 levels) between \nparticipants and the three measures of executive functioning as dependent variables. \nOrthogonal contrasts were employed in which heavy ecstasy users were compared to \nlight users and the two ecstasy user groups combined compared with nonusers. \nOrthogonal contrasts were used as they allow inter-group comparisons to be made while \ncontrolling the Type 1 error rate without the need to adjust the alpha level per comparison \n(Tabachnick & Fidell, 2001). \nParticipants.  \nFourteen heavy ecstasy users (mean age 22.86; 9 male), 39 light ecstasy users \n(mean age 21.41; 19 male) and 28 non-user controls (mean age 20.71; 7 male) took part \nin the study. The heavy users group comprised all of those users with an estimated \nlifetime dose exceeding 400 tablets, (mean 1000.21, s.d., 786.41). Light users were those \nwith an estimated lifetime dose of less than 400 tablets, (mean 149.69, s.d., 96.91). The \ncut off point of four hundred tablets was determined by trial and error so as to produce a \nhigh use group with a mean lifetime dose of 1000 tablets as this was the level of exposure \ncharacterising the ecstasy users in our previous study (Wareing et al 2000). Nonusers \nwere those who indicated that they had never used ecstasy. Participants were recruited via \ndirect approach to university students, and the snowball technique (Solowij et al, 1992). \nWith 14 ecstasy users, the present sample is sufficient to detect a difference of 1.2\u0018\u0003IRU\u0003\u012e\u0003\nJohn E Fisk \n7 \n \u0003\u0011\u0013\u0018\u0003DQG\u0003\u0215\u0003 \u0011\u0015\u0013\u0003\u000b+LQNOH\u0003HW\u0003DO\u000f\u0003\u0014\u001c\u001c\u0017\f\u0011\u00033DUWLFLSDQWV\u0003ZHUH\u0003UHTXHVWHG\u0003WR\u0003UHIUDLQ\u0003IURP\u0003HFVWDV\\\u0003\nuse for at least 7 days and ideally 10 days prior to testing. The mean period of abstinence \nwas actually 22 and 27 weeks for heavy users and light users respectively; median \nabstinence period 5.5 and 4 weeks respectively. Participants were also requested not to \nuse any other illicit drugs for at least 24 hours and ideally for 7 days prior to testing.  \nMeasures.  \nPatterns of drug use and other relevant lifestyle variables were investigated via \nmeans of a background questionnaire. The questionnaire gauged the use of ecstasy and \nother drugs, as well as age, years of education, general health and other relevant lifestyle \nvariables. In relation to other drugs, participants were asked a range of questions \nincluding frequency and duration of use and the last time that they had used each drug. \nParticipants were also questioned concerning their history of drug use, and using a \ntechnique employed by Montgomery, et al (2005), these data were used to estimate total \nlifetime use for each drug. Average weekly dose and the amount of each drug consumed \nwithin the previous 30 days were also assessed. Fluid intelligence was measured via \nRaven\u2019s Progressive Matrices (Raven et al, 1998), and premorbid intelligence was \nassessed via the National Adult Reading Test (NART, Nelson, 1982).   \nLetter Span: Consonants were presented sequentially on a computer screen for \n1.25 seconds. Participants were then required to recall the letters in the order in which \nthey were presented. The task commences with three sets of two letters, and is then \nincreased to three sets of three, four, five etc., until the individual fails on at least two out \nof three trials. Digit span was administered in a similar manner except that the letters \nwere replaced with digits. \nJohn E Fisk \n8 \nUpdating. Updating has been used extensively as a measure of prefrontal \nexecutive functioning. (see for example, Fisk & Sharp, 2003; 2004; Miyake et al, 2000; \nMorris & Jones, 1990; Smith-Spark & Fisk, in press; van der Linden et al 1999). The \nparticipant\u2019s letter span, \u2018n\u2019, was determined. In the consonant updating task the \nparticipant was presented with a random sequence of between n and n+6 consonants on a \ncomputer screen. Twenty-four such lists were presented, and in each case, the participant \nwas unaware of the number of consonants to be presented. The task was always to recall \nthe most recent \u2018n\u2019 consonants in the order in which they were presented. (Thus the \nmaintenance element of the task was limited to the individual\u2019s actual span. This \ncontrasts favourably with our previous study where at six letters the maintenance \nrequirement exceeded the span of most of our participants.) The participant experienced \nsix trials at each of the four list lengths: n, n+2, n+4, and n+6 items. The order in which \nthe lists were presented was randomised. A single composite score of updating was \ncalculated by computing the average number correct for each serial position over the 6 \ntrials at each list length. The resulting figures were then averaged over list length and \nserial position. \nThe spatial updating task was analogous to consonant updating except that it \ninvolved the serial recall of cells that were highlighted sequentially, one at a time, in a \nCorsi style display. The participant\u2019s spatial span, \u2018n\u2019, was determined. In the updating \ntask the participant was presented with a random sequence of between n and n+6 cells \nhighlighted on a computer screen in a Corsi style configuration. Twenty-four such \nsequences were presented, and in each case, the participant was unaware of the number of \ncells that were highlighted. The task was always to recall the most recent \u2018n\u2019 cells in the \nJohn E Fisk \n9 \norder in which they were presented. As in the consonant task, the participant experienced \nsix trials at each of the sequence lengths. The order in which the lists were presented was \nrandomised. A single composite score of updating was calculated using the same \nprocedure as outlined for the consonant updating task.  \nComputation Span. Computation span has been used extensively as an indicator \nof working memory functioning in the cognitive ageing literature (Fisk & Warr, 1996; \nSalthouse & Babcock, 1991) and it is similar to the operation span measure used by \nMiyake, et al (2000) in their investigation of executive processes. Participants were \nrequired to solve a number of arithmetic problems (e.g., 4+7 = ?) by circling one of three \nmultiple-choice answers as each problem was presented. They were also required to \nsimultaneously remember the second digit of each presented problem. At the end of each \nset of problems the second digits had to be recalled in the order in which they were \npresented. The number of arithmetic problems that the participant had to solve, while at \nthe same time remembering each second digit, gradually increased as the test proceeded. \nFor each of the first three trials only a single problem was presented. For the next three \ntrials, two problems were presented. Subsequently, the number of problems presented per \ntrial increased by one every third trial. In order to proceed, the participant was required to \nbe correct in at least two of the three trials at the current level. Computation span was \ndefined as the maximum number of end digits recalled in serial order, with the added \nrequirement that the corresponding arithmetic problems had been solved correctly. In \norder to take account of individual differences in the non-executive maintenance \ncomponent of the task, the load on executive resources was computed as the percentage \nJohn E Fisk \n10 \ndifference between the computation and digit span scores. Large percentage differences \nare indicative of poor executive functioning. \nRandom letter generation. A computer display and concurrent auditory signal was \nused to pace responses. Participants were asked to speak aloud a letter every time the \nsignal was presented. They were told to produce only consonants (i.e., to avoid the letters \na, e, i, o, and u); to avoid repeating the same sequence of letters; to avoid producing \nalphabetically ordered sequences; and to try to speak each letter with the same overall \nfrequency. Individuals attempted to produce three sets of 100 letters; one set at a rate of \none letter every 4 s, a second set at one letter every 2 s, and a third at one letter every 1 s. \nThe order in which the sets were generated was randomised. The experimenter recorded \nthe responses on an answer sheet. The test yields four scores. First, the number of \nalphabetically ordered pairs; second, a repeat sequences score corresponding to the \nnumber of times that the same letter pair is repeated; third, a \u201credundancy\u201d score, which \nmeasures the extent to which all 26 letters of the alphabet are produced equally often (0% \nbeing truly random); and fourth, the number of vowel intrusions. In all cases, higher \nscores are indicative of poor performance.  \nProcedure.  \nParticipants were informed of the general purpose of the experiment, and written \ninformed consent was obtained. The tests were administered under laboratory conditions, \nand a computer running MS-DOS was used for the computer based tasks. The tests were \nadministered in the following order: background questionnaire, random letter generation, \ndigit, letter, and spatial span, computation span, letter and spatial updating, Raven\u2019s \nprogressive matrices, and the NART. Participants were fully debriefed, paid \u00a315 in store \nJohn E Fisk \n11 \nvouchers, and given drugs education leaflets. The study was approved by the Ethics \nCommittee of Liverpool John Moores University, and was administered in accordance \nwith the Declaration of Helsinki.  \n \nResults \n There were no significant differences between the groups on the Raven\u2019s and \nNART measures and the number of years of education. Inspection of Table 1 reveals that \nage differed significantly between the groups. Tukey\u2019s test revealed that heavy users were \nsignificantly older than the other two groups, p<.01 and p<.05 in relation to nonusers and \nlight users respectively. Light users and nonusers did not differ significantly from each \nother. Table 1 also contains mean simple span scores (digit, letter and spatial) for each of \nthe three groups. Ecstasy users were unimpaired on these measures in fact scoring \nmarginally higher compared to non ecstasy users. \n<Insert Table 1 about here> \nThe vast majority of all of the groups had previous exposure to cannabis. Ninety-\nthree percent of heavy ecstasy users, 87% of light users and 75% of non ecstasy users \nindicated that they had used cannabis. Cocaine use was also common among ecstasy \nusers. All heavy ecstasy users and 72% of light ecstasy users indicated that they had \npreviously used cocaine. However, only 11% of nonusers had had any exposure to this \ndrug. Other drugs that had been previously used included amphetamine and LSD but use \nof these was less prevalent and limited to the ecstasy user groups. Sixty-four percent of \nheavy ecstasy users and 33% of light ecstasy users indicated that they had previously \nused amphetamine. The equivalent figures for LSD were respectively, 64% and 13%. For \nJohn E Fisk \n12 \nthose drugs where it was possible to quantify the level of use a number of relevant \nmeasures are set out in Table 2. Heavy ecstasy users also consumed substantial quantities \nof cocaine and cannabis. Light ecstasy users also used these drugs but to a lesser extent. \nAmong non ecstasy users the only illicit drug that was used was cannabis but the \nexposure to this drug was of a lower order compared to the other two groups. (Three non \necstasy users indicated that they had used cocaine on one or two previous occasions but \nwere unable to quantify the amount.) For the most part the measures of drug use were not \nnormally distributed. In many instances the median response was zero and more generally \nthe distributions were positively skewed. In addition the group variances were generally \nheterogeneous. As a consequence nonparametric analyses were used with the results \nrevealing that most of the indicators of drug use set out in Table 2 differed significantly \nbetween the groups. With regard to differences between the two ecstasy user groups, \nheavy users scored significantly higher than light users in terms of total lifetime and \naverage weekly consumption of both cannabis and cocaine. Heavy users had used ecstasy \nand cocaine significantly longer than light users although length of cannabis user did not \ndiffer significantly between the two ecstasy user groups. Also there were no significant \ndifferences between heavy and light ecstasy users in terms of their use of illicit drugs in \nthe previous 10 and 30 days. \n <Insert Table 2 about here> \nOutcomes for the different aspects of executive functioning are set out in Table 3. In all \naspects of random letter generation the scores were similar between the groups. Mixed \nANOVA was used with group between participants and rate of letter generation within. \nConsistent with the trends evident in the means, none of the group effects were \nJohn E Fisk \n13 \nstatistically significant, for each of the four analyses (redundancy, repeat sequences, \nalphabetical sequences and vowel intrusions), F < 1. Also in each case the interaction \nbetween group and rate of letter generation was non significant, again in each of the four \nanalyses, F < 1. The number of letters produced was close to ceiling (i.e., 100 letters) for \nall groups at the four and two second generation rates. Although performance declined at \nthe one second rate this was equally apparent for all groups. The maximal number of \nletters generated by most participants at the four and two second rates prevents \nmeaningful analysis. However, ANOVA with group between participants and the number \nof letters generated at the one second rate as the dependent variable revealed no \nsignificant difference between the groups, F < 1.  Thus to summarise the present results \nprovide no evidence of ecstasy-related differences in the inhibition component executive \nprocess on which random letter generation is known to load. \n<Insert Table 3 about here> \n The percentage reduction in capacity associated with the concurrent processing \ncomponent of the computation span task is set out in Table 3 along with the outcomes for \nthe spatial and verbal (consonant) updating tasks. All three measures are believed to load \non the updating executive component process. For each of these three indicators of \nexecutive functioning non ecstasy users outperform both ecstasy user groups. Non users \nexhibit substantially lower costs in relation to the processing component of the \ncomputation span task. They also exhibit more efficient updating both in relation to \nverbal and visuo-spatial stimuli. MANOVA with user group between participants and the \nthree measures of the updating component executive process as dependent variables \nrevealed a significant multivariate group effect, Wilks\u2019 lambda = .836, F(6,150)=2.34, \nJohn E Fisk \n14 \np<.05. Regarding the univariate outcomes, the group differences were statistically \nsignificant for both computation span and spatial updating, with F values of 3.23 and 3.97 \nrespectively on 2,77 degrees of freedom, p<.05 in both cases. The group difference for \nthe verbal updating task failed to reach significance, F(2,77) = 2.23, p>.05. Difference \ncontrasts revealed that nonusers performed significantly better than the combined user \ngroups on the computation span and spatial updating measures, p<.05 and p<.01 \nrespectively, the difference approached significance for the verbal updating task, p=.091. \nHowever, the contrasts revealed that the two user groups did not differ from each other \non any of the updating measures, p>.05 in all cases. \n As inspection of Table 2 revealed, ecstasy users (especially heavy users) \nconsumed considerably more cannabis compared to non ecstasy users both in terms of \nlong term and recent use. It is possible therefore that various aspects of cannabis use may \nhave accounted for the ecstasy-related group differences that were obtained on the \nupdating executive component measures. To control for this possibility, the MANOVA \nwas repeated with the two long term (total lifetime consumption and average weekly \nconsumption) and two short term measures of cannabis use (amount used in the last 10 \nand 30 days) as covariates. The multivariate group effect remained significant, Wilks\u2019 \nlambda = .793, F(6,118)=2.42, p<.05. Regarding the univariate outcomes, the group \ndifferences were statistically significant for verbal updating and spatial updating with F \nvalues of 3.86 and 3.62 respectively on 2,61 degrees of freedom, p<.05 in both cases. The \ngroup difference for the computation task approached significance, F(2,61) = 3.02, \np=.056. Difference contrasts revealed that nonusers performed significantly better than \nthe combined user groups on all three measures, p<.05 in all cases, while the two user \nJohn E Fisk \n15 \ngroups did not differ significantly from each other on any of the measures, p>.05 in all \ncases. Tests for homogeneity of regression were conducted for each covariate with \nrespect to each of the dependent variables yielding a total of 12 analyses. In 11 of the 12 \ncases, homogeneity of regression was obtained, p>.05, for the covariate by group \ninteraction in all cases. In one case homogeneity of regression was not obtained. This was \nin relation to average weekly cannabis consumption and the computation span measure \nwhere the covariate by group interaction yielded F(2,62) = 4.81, p<.05.  \n The absence of cocaine users among the non-ecstasy users makes it impossible to \ncontrol statistically for the potentially confounding effects of cocaine use since it is not \npossible to test for homogeneity of regression. To evaluate the extent to which cocaine \nuse (as well as ecstasy and cannabis use) is associated with performance on the updating \nexecutive component measures we examined the correlations (Spearman\u2019s rho) between \nthe different aspects of drug use and the outcomes on the updating measures. The results \nare set out in Table 4. It is clear that only aspects of ecstasy use are significantly \ncorrelated with the updating executive component measures. None of the aspects of \ncocaine use are associated with statistically significant correlations. \n<Insert Table 4 about here> \nDiscussion \n No significant ecstasy-related differences were observed in the random letter \ngeneration task. The consonants only version used here was the same as that used in our \nearly research and as noted above this was associated with a significant group difference \nin our initial study (Wareing et al, 2000). Mean lifetime consumption of ecstasy tablets \nexceeded 1000 in that study which is appreciably higher than was apparent in our \nJohn E Fisk \n16 \nsubsequent research. Furthermore there is clear evidence that restricting the letter set to \nconsonants only, caused particular problems for the ecstasy users groups in Wareing et \nal\u2019s (2000) study as they produced significantly more vowel intrusions under all \ngeneration rates. Thus it had been conjectured that deficits might be found in the present \nstudy among heavy chronic users on the consonants only version of the task. However, \nthe results presented here demonstrated that this was not the case. The basis for the \nsignificant group difference in our original study (Wareing et al, 2000) remains unclear. \nWith just 10 participants in each group, the sample sizes were small. Furthermore in our \nprevious study, we did not assess participants on measures of intelligence. Thus it \nremains possible that the differences we observed might have been due to some \npremorbid factor other than drug use. The fact that the present study along with other \nrecent results from our laboratory (Fisk et al 2004; Montgomery et al 2005) have not \nrevealed ecstasy related deficits in random letter generation suggest that this aspect of \ncognitive functioning is unimpaired. Since random letter generation is an established \nmeasure of the inhibition component executive process, it would seem reasonable to \nconclude that ecstasy use does not adversely affect this aspect of cognition. \n Research from our own laboratory has suggested that ecstasy use may be \nassociated with deficits in the updating executive component process. Two measures of \nthe updating function appear to be subject to ecstasy-related impairment, computation \nspan and letter updating (Montgomery et al, 2005). However, with regard to the latter, in \nour previous study, participants were required to maintain a load of six letters while \nconcurrently performing the updating task. It appears that this load exceeded the letter \nspan of the majority of participants and for these individuals it would have been \nJohn E Fisk \n17 \nimpossible to perform the maintenance element of the task. This raises the question of \nwhether any serial rehearsal element and concurrent updating activity was actually \noccurring. It is possible that participants may have adopted a free recall strategy with a \nreliance on the recency component of the process. Baddeley and Hitch (1993) have \nargued that the recency phenomenon is distinct from the maintenance and processing \nfunctions of working memory. Thus while we have demonstrated an ecstasy related \ndeficit in letter updating, this may not in fact reflect an executive function deficit. In an \nimportant early study of the updating process Morris and Jones (1990) addressed this \nproblem by running two experiments, the first with a load of six letters and the second \nwith a load of four letters. However, reducing the load to four letters is not without \nproblems as it makes it possible for those individuals with large letter spans to avoid \nupdating all together by encoding and serially rehearsing the entire sequence where the \npresented sequence length allows this. In order to address this problem, in the present \nstudy participants were required to maintain a load that was equivalent to their letter span. \nThe orthogonal difference contrasts revealed that following control for group differences \nin cannabis consumption ecstasy users performed worse than nonusers on all three \nmeasures of the updating component executive process, including the letter updating task, \ncomputation span, and visuo-spatial updating. Thus it can be argued with some degree of \nconfidence that ecstasy users are impaired on this executive component function. \nIt has been argued that the storage aspects of the working memory system are \ndomain specific while processing is domain-general in nature (e.g., Bayliss et al 2003; \nKane et al , 2004). Thus verbal and visuo spatial information would be stored by \nfunctionally separate systems but the processing component of tasks utilising this \nJohn E Fisk \n18 \ninformation would be domain-general in nature. Given that ecstasy users have been found \nto exhibit deficits in verbal updating, the domain general nature of the process would \nimply that deficits should also be apparent in updating visuo-spatial information. In our \nprevious research we have found ecstasy users to be impaired in a visuo-spatial complex \nspan task (Wareing et al, 2004; 2005). While analogous verbal tasks have been found to \nload on the updating component executive process (Miyake et al, 2000; Fisk & Sharp, \n2004), it is unclear whether this applies to the visuo-spatial working memory task that we \nemployed previously. The present study has used an analogue of the verbal updating task, \nin which individuals were required to maintain and update a spatial sequence and it was \nestablished that ecstasy users were significantly impaired on this task relative to nonusers. \nThe presence of deficits on both the verbal and visuo-spatial updating tasks is consistent \nwith Baylis et al (2003) and Kane et al\u2019s (2004) view of working memory and it may be \nthat the deficits observed reflect an ecstasy-related impairment in this domain general \nupdating process. \nThe present findings may be viewed in the context of recent neuroscience \nevidence. It is known that MDMA affects both serotonergic and dopaminergic systems \n(e.g. Kish et al, 2002). Functional neuroimaging studies indicating that ecstasy/polydrug-\nrelated neurotransmitter changes may be concentrated in the dorsolateral and parietal \nregions of the prefrontal cortex (Cohen et al, 1996), and in addition may give rise to \nsignificantly lower grey matter concentrations in multiple brain regions (bilateral BA 18 \nand cerebellum, left BA 21 and left BA 45, as well as the midline brainstem; Cowan et al. \n2003). Memory updating has been particularly linked to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex \n(Goldman-Rakic, 1996) while performance on the letter-updating task is most strongly \nJohn E Fisk \n19 \nassociated with the left fronto-polar cortex (Collette et al, 2006; Van-der-Linden et al, \n1999). So it is likely that the deficits observed in the present study reflect reduced \nserotonergic/dopaminergic functioning in specific regions of the prefrontal cortex.  \nAs with most studies in this area, a number of limitations need to be \nacknowledged. Due to the quasi-experimental design of the study, it is possible that the \ngroups in each study may have differed on some variable other than ecstasy use. The \ngroups differed significantly in age and although the tests administered are subject to age-\nrelated decline, this does not typically occur until old age. None of the participants tested \nin the present study were more than 27 years old. Group differences in other variables \nsuch as general health, nutrition, or some premorbid condition predating drug use \n(Verheul, 2001) cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, due to limited resources we were \nunable to provide an objective measure of recent drug use (e.g. from hair or urine \nsamples). However, most published studies testing cognitive deficits among ecstasy users \nhave not used these techniques (e.g. Fox et al, 2002; Morgan, 1998; Rodgers, 2000). We \nwere able to statistically control for group differences in both recent and longer term \naspects of cannabis use. Furthermore, aspects of ecstasy use were more closely correlated \nwith the cognitive outcomes compared to the equivalent correlations with cocaine use. \nHowever it must be acknowledged that a minority of the ecstasy users had in the past \nused amphetamine and a small number LSD. We cannot therefore entirely exclude the \npossibility that these drugs may have played some role in the results that were obtained. \n \n \n \nJohn E Fisk \n20 \nReferences \nBaddeley AD (1966).

Our study shows that attentional training using the dot probe task \nmay influence the amount of attention that is given to the spatial location of threat, but \nnot necessarily the amount of attention that is given to the semantic content of stimuli. \n \n \nKeywords: attentional bias, training, threat, anxiety, transfer \nTRANSFER OF ATTENTIONAL RETRAINING \n \n3 \nLimited Transfer of Threat Bias Following Attentional Retraining \nA basic tenet of several cognitive theories of anxiety disorders is that certain \ninformation processing biases are at the core of fear and anxiety disorders (e.g., Beck, \nEmery, & Greenberg, 1985; Eysenck, 1992; Mogg & Bradley, 1998; Williams, Watts, \nMacLeod, & Mathews, 1997). For instance, Williams et al. suggested that anxious \nindividuals are more likely to interpret ambiguous events as threatening (interpretation \nbias), to recall threatening episodes from memory (memory bias), and to orient to \nthreatening information in their environment (attentional bias). Importantly, these \nprocessing biases have been argued to be not just epiphenomena of fear and anxiety, but \nmay be causally involved in the aetiology or maintenance of fear and anxiety (e.g., \nWilliams et al.).  \nA crucial test of this causality assumption was provided by MacLeod, \nRutherford, Campbell, Ebsworthy and Holker (2002), who trained participants to either \navoid or attend to threatening words using a dot probe paradigm (MacLeod, Mathews, \n& Tata, 1986). In this paradigm, two cues (typically one threatening and one neutral \nstimulus) are presented on different spatial locations, and participants are required to \nrespond as quickly and as accurately as possible to the location or the identity of the \ntarget. An attentional bias towards threatening stimuli is inferred from faster responses \non trials where the target appears on the same location as the threatening cue (congruent \ntrials) compared to trials where the target appears on the location of the neutral cue \n(incongruent trials). In order to change attentional bias, MacLeod et al. (2002) \nmanipulated the proportion of congruent and incongruent trials between participants. In \nan attend threat group, they presented more congruent trials, whereas in an avoid threat \ngroup, they presented more incongruent trials. After this attentional training phase, \nTRANSFER OF ATTENTIONAL RETRAINING \n \n4 \nparticipants who were trained to avoid threat experienced less emotional distress during \na stressful task compared to participants who were trained to attend to threat. This result \nhas inspired researchers to investigate the clinical application of computerized attention \ntraining to reduce anxiety symptoms. Recently, experimentally induced reductions in \nattentional bias using the modified dot probe task have been shown to reduce symptoms \nof social anxiety (Amir, Weber, Beard, Bomyea, & Taylor, 2008; Amir, Beard, Taylor \net al., 2009; Li, Tan, Qian, & Liu, 2008; Schmidt, Richey, Buckner, & Timpano, 2009) \nand generalized anxiety disorder (Amir, Beard, Burns, & Bomyea, 2009; Hazen, Vasey, \n& Schmidt, 2009). As such, the reduction of attentional bias seems to be effective as a \nclinical intervention for anxiety disorders (e.g., Hakamata et al., 2010).  \nDespite the clinical potential of attentional bias training for anxiety disorders, \nsome reservations need to be taken into consideration. First, attentional bias training \nseems not to be effective for all anxiety disorders. For instance, Reese, McNally, Najmi \nand Amir (2010) found no differences in spider fear between participants who were \ntrained to avoid spiders and participants in a no-training control group (see also Van \nBockstaele et al., 2011). Second, although attentional bias modification is effective in \nreducing symptoms of anxiety, we know little about the processes through which this \ntherapeutic effect is accomplished. One such mechanism may be generalization. Indeed, \nit is often implicitly assumed that the training for a specific set of threatening stimuli \ngeneralizes to other stimuli. That is, it is assumed that after training the individual will \navoid all threatening stimuli, and not only the stimuli that were used during training. \nLikewise, it is often implicitly assumed that the attentional effects obtained after \ntraining with the dot probe task are not restricted to that particular paradigm, but also \nmay be found in other situations or paradigms. Noteworthy, the selection of the dot \nTRANSFER OF ATTENTIONAL RETRAINING \n \n5 \nprobe task as a training procedure has mainly been based on practical considerations \n(see Mathews & MacLeod, 2002), and there is yet little research on whether the \nmodified dot probe task is suitable to change attentional functioning in everyday life. As \nsuch, the applied potential of the modified dot probe task as an attentional training task \ndepends on how well the obtained attentional training effect transfers to other tasks, \nsettings, and stimuli. At present, this feature of the modified dot probe task has received \nonly limited study. In two studies, Amir and colleagues (Amir et al., 2008, Amir, Beard, \nTaylor et al., 2009) found that attentional training with the dot probe task generalized to \nattentional bias for threatening words as measured with a spatial cueing task. However, \nthe spatial cueing task is highly similar to the dot probe task so this effect only suggests \nthat there is transfer of training to conditions that very closely resemble the training \nconditions (close transfer). To date, more broad levels of transfer of training have not \nbeen scrutinized.  \nIn the present study, we investigated transfer of training of two different \nattentional manipulations in the dot probe task on emotional interference. Emotional \ninterference was assessed both within the dot probe task and in a separate interference \ntask, similar to the one used by Mogg, Garner, Holmes, and Bradley (2008). We trained \none group of participants to attend towards threatening pictures, whereas we trained \nanother group of participants to avoid threat. This training was preceded and followed \nby a standard version of the dot probe task to investigate whether training was \nsuccessful in changing attentional bias, and whether the training led to reduced \ninterference within the dot probe task. After the attentional training phase, participants \ncompleted an emotional interference task with a new set of pictures. In this task, a \nsingle stimulus, either threatening or neutral, preceded the presentation of a target. \nTRANSFER OF ATTENTIONAL RETRAINING \n \n6 \nTypically, participants are slower to respond to the target if it was preceded by an \nemotional picture relative to a neutral picture (e.g., Schimmack, 2005). The underlying \nmechanism of the interference effect has been related a difficulty to disengage attention \naway from threatening stimuli (e.g., Fox, Russo, Bowles, & Dutton, 2001). According \nto this view, the irrelevant emotional dimension of the cue holds attention, which in turn \nimpairs the processing of other, task-relevant stimuli and thus delays the appropriate \nresponse (see also De Houwer & Tibboel, 2010). If the interference effect is based on \nsuch difficulty to disengage attention away from threat, the attentional training \nmanipulation should have a clear impact on this effect. More specifically, as participants \nin the avoid threat group are trained to disengage their attention away from threat, they \nshould be less influenced by the threatening cues in the interference task, leading to a \nsmaller interference effect. Finally, after the interference task, participants rated all \nstimuli for arousal, valence and threat value. In general, fear and anxiety are emotions \nthat are marked by high levels of arousal and negative affect (e.g., Rachman, 1998). \nTherefore, one can hypothesize that a therapeutic intervention that is supposed to reduce \nfear and anxiety \u2013 such as the attentional bias modification procedure \u2013 might also \nreduce these feelings of arousal and negative affect.  \nMethod \nParticipants  \nFifty-nine first-year students (21 men, average age = 20.54 years old, SD = 2.96) \nparticipated in the experiment as a partial fulfilment of course requirements. All \nparticipants signed an informed consent form prior to the beginning of the experiment.  \nApparatus and Materials \nTRANSFER OF ATTENTIONAL RETRAINING \n \n7 \nThe entire experiment was programmed using the Inquisit Millisecond 2.0 \n(2007) software package, and it was run on a Dell Optiplex GX520 desktop computer \nwith a 100Hz 19-inch colour monitor. We selected 24 pictures from the International \nAffective Picture System (IAPS; Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert, 2005; pictures of the IAPS \nhave been validated for the current population, Verschuere, Crombez, & Koster, 2001).\n1\n \nOf these 24 pictures, 12 were threatening and 12 were neutral. We divided the \nthreatening pictures in two subsets, matched for valence and arousal (IAPS ratings: \nvalence subset 1 = 2.98, SD = 0.74, valence subset 2 = 2.67, SD = 0.79, arousal subset 1 \n= 6.83, SD = 0.37, arousal subset 2 = 6.90, SD = 0.27; ts < 1). Likewise, the neutral \npictures were also divided in two subsets (IAPS ratings: valence subset 1 = 4.95, SD = \n0.45, valence subset 2 = 5.00, SD = 0.36, arousal subset 1 = 2.86, SD = 0.52, arousal \nsubset 2 = 2.93, SD = 0.72; ts < 1). For both threatening and neutral pictures, one subset \nwas used in the dot probe task, and the other was used in the interference task. The \nassignment of different subsets of pictures to either the dot probe task or the interference \ntask was counterbalanced across participants. Finally, we selected an extra set of six \nneutral pictures (IAPS ratings: valence = 5.30, SD = 0.51, arousal = 2.68, SD = 0.32) for \npractice trials and neutral dot probe trials (see below).  \nQuestionnaires \nWe used the Dutch translations of the state and trait versions of the State and \nTrait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S and STAI-T: Spielberger, Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg, & \nJacobs, 1983; van der Ploeg, Defares, & Spielberger, 1980) to assess our participants\u2019 \nlevels of anxiety. Both questionnaires consist of 20 items, and each item is scored on a \nfour-point Likert scale. The STAI-S assesses the individual\u2019s present level of anxiety, \nwhereas the STAI-T measures a more general susceptibility to experience emotional \nTRANSFER OF ATTENTIONAL RETRAINING \n \n8 \ndistress over an extended period of time. Alpha coefficients in the present study were \n.88 for the STAI-S and .93 for the STAI-T.  \nDot Probe Task \nThe dot probe task contained four different trial types. On congruent trials, the \ntarget was presented on the location that was cued with a threatening picture. On \nincongruent trials, the target appeared on the location of the neutral picture. On neutral \ntrials, both cue pictures were neutral, and the target could follow on either location. \nFinally, we encouraged participants to focus on the centre of the screen by presenting \ndigit trials. On these trials, the fixation cross was replaced by a digit ranging from one \nto three after 1000 ms. This digit remained on the screen for 100 ms. Participants were \nrequired to indicate which digit they had seen by pressing the corresponding key on the \nupper left of a standard AZERTY keyboard. Participants were required to guess if they \nwere unsure about the answer. In this manner, poor performance on digit trials indicates \npoor motivation of the participant or a lack of fixation on the fixation cross.  \nAll stimuli in the dot probe task were presented on a black background. Each \ntrial started with the presentation of a fixation cross in the centre of the screen, and two \ngrey rectangles, one above and one below the fixation cross. These rectangles were 4 \ncm high by 5.3 cm wide, and the distance between the centre of the rectangles and the \nfixation cross was 4 cm. All cues and targets were presented in the centre of the grey \nrectangles. In congruent and incongruent trials, the cue pairs consisted of one randomly \nselected threatening picture and one randomly selected neutral picture, whereas on \nneutral trials, both pictures were neutral. The pictures were adjusted to fit the size of the \ngrey rectangles. The pictures were presented for 500 ms, and were replaced by a 20 ms \ngrey mask. Next, a target stimulus appeared. Targets consisted of either the letter \u2018F\u2019 or \nTRANSFER OF ATTENTIONAL RETRAINING \n \n9 \nthe letter \u2018E\u2019, and remained on the screen until a response was given. Participants \nresponded by pressing either the \u20181\u2019 or the \u20183\u2019 key of the numeric pad of the keyboard \nwith the index or middle finger of their dominant hand, and the next trial started 500 ms \nafter a response was given. Targets were presented equally often above as below the \nfixation cross, and were equally often an E as an F. The assignment of the response keys \nto the targets was counterbalanced across participants.  \nThe dot probe task consisted of four different phases. First, participants \ncompleted a practice phase consisting of 24 neutral trials and 3 digit trials. In this \nphase, an error message appeared on incorrect responses. The data of this phase were \nnot analysed. The second phase was the pre-training assessment phase. This phase \nconsisted of 48 congruent trials, 48 incongruent trials, 24 neutral trials and 6 digit trials. \nThe third phase was the attentional training phase. In this phase, participants were \nrandomly assigned to one of two groups. In the attend threat group, we presented three \nblocks consisting each of 96 congruent trials, 24 neutral trials and 6 digit trials. In the \navoid threat group, we also presented three blocks, each consisting of 96 incongruent \ntrials, 24 neutral trials and 6 digit trials. The fourth and last phase was the post-training \nassessment phase, which was identical to the pre-training assessment phase. This last \nphase allowed us to investigate whether our manipulation of attention successfully \ninduced an attentional bias towards versus away from threat.  \nInterference Task \nEach trial in the interference task started with the presentation of as single grey \nrectangle (5.3 cm wide by 4 cm high) in the centre of the screen, and a black fixation \ncross in the centre of this rectangle. After 1000 ms, the fixation cross was randomly \nreplaced by either a threatening or a neutral picture. All pictures were adjusted to the \nTRANSFER OF ATTENTIONAL RETRAINING \n \n10 \nsame size of the grey rectangle. The picture remained on the screen for 200 ms, and was \nreplaced by a grey mask for 50 ms. Then, a target appeared in the centre of the screen. \nThe target was either an \u2018&\u2019 or an \u2018@\u2019, and participants were required to identify the \ntarget as fast and as accurately as possible by pressing the \u2018W\u2019 or the \u2018?\u2019 key of a \nstandard AZERTY keyboard with their left or right index finger respectively. Both \ntargets were presented equally often, and the assignment of the response keys to specific \ntargets was counterbalanced across participants. The intertrial interval varied randomly \nbetween 500 and 1050 ms.  \nThe interference task consisted of two phases. First, in order to acquaint \nparticipants with the task at hand, they completed a practice phase. In this phase, we \nused the same pictures as the ones that we used in the neutral dot probe trials. The \npractice phase consisted of 24 trials, and an error message was presented on incorrect \nresponses. The data of the practice phase were not analysed. The second phase was the \ntest phase, which consisted of two identical blocks. In each block, each picture was \npresented eight times, for a total of 96 trials per block. No error messages were \npresented on incorrect responses in the test blocks.  \nPicture Ratings \nAfter the interruption task, participants were shown all pictures that were used in \nthe experiment (12 threatening and 12 neutral), except the six neutral pictures from the \npractice phases and the neutral dot probe trials. Each picture was presented against a \nblack background, and participants could look at the picture for as long as they wanted. \nIn order to proceed to the rating screen, participants pushed the space bar. We recorded \nthe picture viewing time as the time between the onset of the pictures and the bar-press. \nLang, Greenwald, Bradley and Hamm (1993) showed that people look longer at \nTRANSFER OF ATTENTIONAL RETRAINING \n \n11 \narousing pictures than neutral pictures, and as such, viewing time can be used as an \nindicator of the arousal of the picture. Upon pressing the space bar, the picture \ndisappeared and participants rated on three separate nine-point Likert scales how \nthreatened (1 = \u201cnot threatened at all\u201d through 9 = \u201cvery threatened\u201d), aroused (1 = \n\u201ccalm, relaxed\u201d through 9 = \u201cvery aroused\u201d) and positive or negative (1 = \u201cpositive\u201d \nthrough 9 = \u201cnegative\u201d) they felt while viewing the picture.  \nGeneral Procedure \nThe experiment was conducted in a dimly lit room, and participants were seated \napproximately 50 cm from the computer screen. First, they completed the STAI-S and \nthe STAI-T. Next, they practiced the dot probe task and their pre-training attentional \nbias was assessed. Upon completion of the pre-training attentional bias assessment \nblock, participants were randomly allocated to either the attend threat group or the avoid \nthreat group and completed the corresponding version (attend threat versus avoid threat) \nof the attentional training task, followed by the post-training attentional bias assessment \nblock and the interference task. Finally, they rated the threat value, arousal and valence \nof all experimental pictures and they again completed the STAI-S.  \nResults \nGroup Characteristics \nAt the beginning of the experiment, average trait anxiety was 35.14 (SD = 8.59) \nand average state anxiety was 31.46 (SD = 5.73). The two groups did not differ on either \ntrait or state anxiety, both Fs < 1, both ps > .46.  \nReaction Time Data \nData reduction and outlier analysis. For the dot probe task, we first removed all \ntrials with errors (3.40%). Next, we trimmed the data by removing reaction times faster \nTRANSFER OF ATTENTIONAL RETRAINING \n \n12 \nthan 150 ms and slower than 1500 ms (0.48%). Individual outliers were defined as \nreaction times deviating more than three SDs from the individuals\u2019 mean, and were also \nremoved (1.59%). We did not analyse the data of neutral trials and the data of the \nattentional training blocks, because these data do not allow for the calculation of \nattentional bias scores. Two participants performed poorly on digit trials (participants\u2019 \nscores = 77% and 80% correct, group mean = 96% correct, SD = 5.06), indicating a lack \nof focus on the fixation cross. Furthermore, two participants made many errors overall \n(participants\u2019 scores = 86% and 87% correct, group mean = 97% correct, SD = 2.62), \nand one participant was overall very slow (participant\u2019s mean latency = 897 ms, group \nmean = 594 ms, SD = 78.73). The data of these five participants were not further \nanalysed. For the remaining 54 participants, we calculated attentional bias scores for \nboth the baseline phase and the test phase by subtracting the mean reaction time on \ncongruent trials from the mean reaction time on incongruent trials. Positive attentional \nbias scores indicate an attentional bias towards threatening stimuli, whereas negative \nattentional bias scores indicate attentional avoidance of threat. We also calculated threat \ninterference scores for the baseline phase and the test phase of the dot probe task by \nsubtracting the mean reaction time on neutral trials (i.e., the trials in which two neutral \npictures were used as cues) from the mean reaction time on trials with a threatening \npicture (i.e., the congruent and incongruent trials). Positive interference scores indicate \nmore interference on trials with a threatening picture than on trials with two neutral \npictures.  \nFor the interference task, we also removed trials with errors (3.54%), latencies \nfaster than 150 ms and slower than 1500 ms (0.47%), and latencies deviating more than \nthree SDs from each individuals\u2019 mean (1.71%). From the remaining data, we calculated \nTRANSFER OF ATTENTIONAL RETRAINING \n \n13 \ninterference scores by subtracting the mean reaction time on neutral trials from the \nmean reaction time on threatening trials. Scores larger than zero indicate interference by \narousing pictures. \nAttentional training effects. We conducted a 2 (Experiment Phase: pre-training \nversus post-training) by 2 (Attention Group: attend threat versus avoid threat) repeated \nmeasures ANOVA on the attentional bias scores. This analysis yielded a marginally \nsignificant main effect of Attention Group, F(1, 52) = 3.13, p = .08. More importantly, \nthe interaction was also significant, F(1, 52) = 16.26, p < .001 (see Figure 1). Follow-up \nanalyses showed that, before the training phase, the attend threat group tended to avoid \nthe threatening pictures relative to the avoid threat group, F(1, 52) = 3.49, p = .07, \nCohen\u2019s d = 0.51.2 In this phase, the attentional bias score of the attend threat group was \nsignificantly smaller than zero, t(25) = 2.12, p < .05, whereas the attentional bias score \nof the avoid threat group did not differ from zero, t(27) < 1, p = .64. After the training \nphase, participants in the attend threat group oriented significantly more to the \nthreatening pictures compared to participants in the avoid threat group, F(1, 52) = \n14.56, p < .001, Cohen\u2019s d = 1.04. Participants in the attend threat group showed a \nmarginally significant attentional bias towards threat, t(25) = 1.81, p = .08, whereas \nparticipants in the avoid threat group showed attentional avoidance of threat, t(27) = \n3.53, p < .005. Finally, the attend threat group showed a significant increase in \nattentional bias from pre- to post-training, F(1, 25) = 7.92, p < .01, Cohen\u2019s \u0192 = 0.56, \nand the avoid threat group showed a significant decrease in attentional bias from pre- to \npost-training, F(1, 27) = 8.54, p < .01, Cohen\u2019s \u0192 = 0.56.3 A 2 (Experiment Phase) x 2 \n(Attention Group) repeated measures ANCOVA with state and trait anxiety at the \nbeginning of the experiment as covariates did not change this pattern of results. In sum, \nTRANSFER OF ATTENTIONAL RETRAINING \n \n14 \nthese data show that we successfully induced an attentional bias towards threat in the \nattend threat group, and we successfully induced attentional avoidance of threat in the \navoid threat group.  \nEffects of attention training on emotional interference. Our design allowed us to \ninvestigate the effect of the attention training on emotional interference in both the dot \nprobe task and the interference task. First, for the dot probe task, we entered the \ninterference scores in a 2 (Experiment Phase: pre-training versus post-training) x 2 \n(Attention Group: attend threat versus avoid threat) repeated measures ANOVA. There \nwere no significant main effects, both Fs < 1, but the interaction was marginally \nsignificant, F(1, 52) = 3.12, p = .084. However, this interaction was mainly driven by a \nmarginally significant difference between the two groups in the baseline phase (Mattend = \n16.19, SD = 22.91; Mavoid = 3.82, SD = 23.29), F(1, 52) = 3.86, p = .055, Cohen\u2019s d = \n0.54. In the test phase, there was no significant difference between the two groups \n(Mattend = 4.12, SD = 30.98; Mavoid = 9.04, SD = 20.41), F(1, 52) < 1. Comparisons of the \ntwo experiment phases revealed that neither the decrease in interference in the attend \nthreat group nor the increase in interference in the avoid group were significant, both Fs \n< 1.99, both ps > .17.  \nNext, we conducted a univariate ANOVA on the interference scores as measured \nin the interference task with Attention Group as a between subjects factor. This analysis \ndid not reveal a significant difference between the two groups, F(1, 52) < 1, p = .37, \nCohen\u2019s d = 0.25. One-sample t-tests showed that both the attend threat group, t(25) = \n5.53, p < .001, and the avoid threat group, t(27) = 3.65, p < .005, responded slower to \ntargets when they were preceded by a threatening picture compared to when they were \npreceded by a neutral picture (see Figure 2). Entering state and trait anxiety before the \nTRANSFER OF ATTENTIONAL RETRAINING \n \n15 \nbeginning of the experiment as covariates in the analyses did not change the pattern of \nresults. Finally, the interference score of the dot probe test phase was significantly \ncorrelated with the interference score of the interference task, r = .33, p < .05. In sum, \nboth attention groups experienced more interference by threatening pictures compared \nto neutral pictures, but the attention training had no effect on the magnitude of the \ninterference effect.  \nEffects of attention training on self reported appraisal of pictures. Overall, the \nthreatening pictures were rated as more threatening, F(1, 53) = 157.27, p < .001, more \narousing, F(1, 53) = 92.30, p < .001, and more negative, F(1, 53) = 92.58, p < .001, than \nthe neutral pictures. There were no differences between the two attention groups on any \nof the ratings of the threatening pictures, all Fs < 1.02, all ps> .31 (see Table 1). Similar \nanalyses but now separately for the set that we used in the dot probe task and the set that \nwe used in the interference task again showed no differences between the two groups on \nany of the picture appraisal variables, all Fs < 1.03, all ps > .31. However, overall, the \nthreatening pictures that were used in the dot probe task were rated as more arousing, \nF(1, 52) = 4.36, p < .05, more threatening, F(1, 52) = 4.18, p < .05, and more negative, \nF(1, 52) = 3.91, p = .053, than the pictures that were used in the interference task. \nFinally, a 2 (Attention Group) x 2 (Picture Type: neutral versus threatening) repeated \nmeasures ANOVA on the viewing times revealed only a main effect of Picture Type, \nF(1, 52) = 51.24, p < .001; all other Fs < 1. As expected, participants looked longer at \nthreatening pictures (M = 2419 ms, SD = 1111) than neutral pictures (M = 1784 ms, SD \n= 717). Hence, our data show that the attentional training had no impact on the appraisal \nof threatening stimuli.  \nDiscussion \nTRANSFER OF ATTENTIONAL RETRAINING \n \n16 \nAccording to several authors, training anxious or fearful individuals to attend \naway from threat is promising therapeutic tool to reduce anxiety (MacLeod, Koster, & \nFox, 2009). More specifically, attentional bias reduction could be an easy to administer \nand cheap first line intervention. In the current study we tested the implicit assumption \nunderlying attentional training research that the attentional changes obtained through the \ntypically used modified dot probe task are not a reflection of mere practice in the dot \nprobe task, but that these attentional changes also transfer to other attention tasks and \nthus fundamentally change attentional processing in everyday life. Despite the \nsuccessful training of attentional bias towards and away from threat as measured with a \nstandard dot probe task, training showed no transfer to levels of emotional interference \n(either measured within the dot probe task or on a subsequent interference task), nor did \nit influence self-rated stimulus properties.  \nAs the absence of any effects of the attentional training on the emotional \ninterference task is unexpected, the validity of this null-finding should be considered. \nFirst, it is possible that our training manipulation was not strong enough to produce the \nexpected pattern of results. Contrary to this explanation, both groups showed a \nsubstantial change in attentional bias in the expected direction from pre- to post-training \nas measured with the dot probe task, with Cohen\u2019s d = 0.55 for both groups. These \nresults clearly show that we induced changes in attentional bias in the dot probe task, \nand thus that our training manipulation was relatively strong.  \nThere are at least two different explanations for why this strong training effect \ndid not transfer to the interference task. First, we used a different picture set for the \nemotional interference task than for the attention training. It is possible that the training \nmanipulation was only effective in changing the allocation of attention for the pictures \nTRANSFER OF ATTENTIONAL RETRAINING \n \n17 \nthat were used in the dot probe task, but not in changing attention for the new pictures \nthat were used in the interference task. However, several studies have shown that \nattentional retraining transfers to new stimulus materials (e.g., Amir, Beard, Burns et al., \n2009). Thus, though possible, it seems unlikely that the absence of group differences in \nthe interference task is caused by the use of a new set of stimuli. Second, it is possible \nthat the attentional training did not transfer to the interference task because the dot \nprobe task involves the spatial allocation of attention, whereas the interference task has \nno such spatial component. The emotional interference effect is driven by a difficulty to \ndisengage attention away from the semantic content of certain stimuli (e.g., Fox, Russo, \nBowles, & Dutton, 2001), whereas attentional bias as measured with the dot probe task \nis mainly based on a difficulty to disengage attention away from the spatial location of \nthreatening stimuli (Koster, Crombez, Verschuere, & De Houwer, 2004). Thus, it is \npossible that the effects of attentional training with the dot probe task are limited to \nspatial attention, and that the effect fails to generalize to other components of attention. \nHowever, we acknowledge that our study offers only a first attempt to investigate the \ntransfer of the attentional training effect in the dot probe task to a non-spatial attention \ntask. Future research in which other measures of attentional bias are used, such as for \ninstance the emotional Stroop paradigm or the attentional blink task, are needed in order \nto further address the question of transfer to other tasks. Bearing this limitation in mind, \na lack of generalization across different sets of stimuli or attentional processes does, \nhowever, pose a challenge for the dominant theories of attentional bias modification. \nAccording to these theories, in order for attention training to influence attention in the \nreal world, training should generalize to both different stimulus materials and different \ncomponents of attention, and thus different measures of attention.  \nTRANSFER OF ATTENTIONAL RETRAINING \n \n18 \nThe present data point to an important hiatus in our knowledge on the attentional \nmechanisms affected by attentional retraining (see also Koster, Baert, Bockstaele, & De \nRaedt, 2010), and they imply that future work should further improve upon the existing \nprocedures to train attention. It is noteworthy that the current version of the dot probe \ntraining has been developed mainly because the dot probe task is a widely used measure \nof attentional bias (Mathews & MacLeod, 2002). From a training perspective, several \nmodifications of current attentional retraining procedure could be useful to optimize the \ntransfer of training to different tasks and situations. First, a training procedure could \nincorporate training on multiple components of attention in different types of visual \ndisplays, instead of the fixed stimulus presentation format in the current training. \nTraining procedures could also be presented to different modalities to facilitate cross-\nmodal transfer of training. Finally, training conditions could be dynamically adjusted \nbased on individual performance. Hence, given the applied potential of attentional \nretraining (e.g., Bar-Haim, 2010), the investigation of optimal training procedures is a \npromising area of research.  \nOur study has several limitations. For instance, in line with other research (e.g., \nAmir et al., 2008; Hazen et al., 2009), we chose to present the cue pictures in the dot \nprobe task for 500 ms. Recently, Staugaard (2010) has argued that this presentation \nduration of 500 ms might be suboptimal, and that the measurement of attentional bias at \nthis presentation duration becomes less reliable. Also, our experiment was conducted \nwith a non-anxious student sample. Further research with (clinically) anxious \nindividuals is needed to investigate whether our observed lack of transfer can be \nreplicated in such populations. Another limitation concerns the difference in attentional \nbias between the two groups in the pre-training assessment phase. As we assigned \nTRANSFER OF ATTENTIONAL RETRAINING \n \n19 \nparticipants randomly to one of the two groups, this baseline difference is hard to \nexplain. However, it is important to note that both groups showed a change in \nattentional bias that was in line with the training manipulation. That is, participants in \nthe attend threat group had a higher attentional bias towards threat after the training, \nwhereas participants in the avoid threat training group showed a decrease in attentional \nbias from pre- to post-training. A more fundamental limitation concerns the possibility \nthat our study lacked the statistical power to capture the possible transfer of these effects \nto the interference task. Using G*Power 3 (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner, 2007), we \ncalculated the magnitude of effect sizes that we should have detected, given our sample \nsize and the conventional value of .80 for minimal statistical power. This analysis \nshowed that our sample was only large enough to detect a relatively large difference, \nwith Cohen\u2019s d = 0.78. Hence, it is well possible that our sample was not large enough \nto detect small to moderate effects. We also did not include a pre-training assessment of \nemotional interference, nor did we ask participants to rate the arousal, valence and \nthreat value of the pictures before the training. Therefore, it is possible that both groups \nshowed a similar decrease in emotional interference and a similar decrease in ratings of \narousal, negative valence and threat value of the stimuli. A final limitation is the \nabsence of a no-training control group. If both attentional manipulations had similar \neffects on the amount of interference, these effects should appear in comparison with \nsuch a no-training control group. Although at first sight it may seem contradictory that \nthe two opposite attentional manipulations have the same effect (e.g., MacLeod et al., \n2002), such data have been reported before. For instance, Klumpp and Amir (2010) \ntrained socially anxious participants to either attend to or avoid threat, and compared \ntheir levels of state anxiety in response to a social stressor with a no-training control \nTRANSFER OF ATTENTIONAL RETRAINING \n \n20 \ngroup. Interestingly, they found that both the attend threat group and the avoid threat \ngroup showed a smaller increase in state anxiety compared to the no-training control \ngroup in response to the social stress task. In sum, the absence of a no-training control \ngroup and a pre-training assessment phase complicates the interpretation of the data of \nour current experiment. It is both possible that neither manipulation of attention had an \neffect on the level of interference and the appraisal of the stimuli, and that both \nmanipulations had the same effect. Therefore, our study does not allow for strong \nconclusions with respect to the influence of changes in attention on the assessment of \nthe arousal, valence and threat value of stimuli. However, our data do suggest that \ntraining individuals to disengage their attention away from threat in a dot probe task \ndoes not necessarily transfer to measures of emotional interference.  \nTRANSFER OF ATTENTIONAL RETRAINING \n \n21 \nAcknowledgements \nPreparation of this paper was supported by Grant BOF/GOA2006/001 of Ghent \nUniversity.

The following IAPS pictures were used in the experiment: threat subset 1: \n1050, 1201, 1930, 6260, 6350, 6550; threat subset 2: 1120, 1300, 6230, 6313, 6540, \n6560; neutral subset 1: 5510, 7006, 7090, 7150, 7190, 7234; neutral subset 2: 7002, \n7009, 7140, 7175, 7224, 7550; neutral practice: 5720, 5740, 6150, 7000, 7050, 7080.  \n2. Effect sizes of group differences were estimated with Cohen\u2019s d. According to \nCohen (1992), values around 0.20 represent small effects, values around 0.50 represent \nmedium effects and values of 0.80 and larger represent large effects. Effect sizes for \nwithin-group differences and interactions were estimated using Cohen\u2019s \u0192, with values \nfrom 0.10 representing small effects, values from 0.25 representing medium effects and \nvalues from 0.40 representing large effects (Cohen, 1992). We calculated \u0192 using the \nfollowing formula: \u0192 = \u221a[\u03b7p\u00b2 / (1 - \u03b7p\u00b2)]. \n3. Overall, the neutral pictures (M = 96.09 cd/m\n2\n, SD = 34.62, range = 41.87 cd/m\n2\n \n- 150.46 cd/m\n2\n) had a marginally higher luminance than the threatening pictures (M = \n68.01 cd/m\n2\n, SD = 35.95, range = 31.51 cd/m\n2\n - 156.21 cd/m\n2\n), F(1, 22) = 3.80, p = \n.067. In order to investigate whether the difference in luminance between the neutral \nand the threatening pictures had a profound effect on our data, we removed all trials \ncontaining one of the two neutral pictures with the highest luminance and all trials \ncontaining one of the two threatening pictures with the lowest luminance levels from the \ndata set. As a result, threatening and neutral pictures did no longer differ with regard to \ntheir luminance, F(1, 18) < 1. A repeated measures ANOVA on the attentional bias \nscores from the remaining data set with Experiment Phase (pre-training versus post-\ntraining) as a within subjects factor, and Training Group (attend threat versus avoid \nthreat) as a between subjects factor revealed a significant interaction between \nTRANSFER OF ATTENTIONAL RETRAINING \n \n31 \nExperiment Phase and Attention Group, F(1, 52) = 11.61, p < .005. Follow-up contrast \ncomparisons showed that participants in the attend threat group attended more to threat \nafter the training (M = 5.09, SD = 28.18) than before the training (M = -12.89, SD = \n28.05), F(1,25) = 6.91, p < .05. Participants in the avoid threat training group avoided \nthreat more following the training (M = -17.73, SD = 31.43) compared to before the \ntraining (M = 1.74, SD = 28.82), F(1, 27) = 5.28, p < .05. Overall, these results closely \nmirror the results of the analyses on the complete data set, and they show that the \ndifferences in luminance between the threatening and neutral pictures are unlikely to \naccount for our general pattern of findings. \n",

This leads to\na degradation of service quality and availability. There-\nfore, the manual reaction to such slow processes under-\nmines the robustness and performance of the complete\nsystem.\nAdding autonomic capabilities to the COSARA system\nThe autonomic computing paradigm aims to develop\nsystems capable of self-management, which make deci-\nsions on their own and respond with appropriate actions\non system failures or optimizations. This concept is in\nanalogy with the autonomic nervous system, which man-\nages our vital functions in the body without conscious\ndirections [1]. In autonomic computing, an autonomic\nmanager implements control loops in which the man-\naged element and the environment is monitored, data is\nanalyzed, and actions are taken if components are in an\nundesirable state. It envisions a self-aware software sys-\ntem. In this article, we extend the existing COSARAhealth\ncare platform with autonomic components. COSARA is\nan infection surveillance and antibiotic management ser-\nvice platform for the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) [2]. We\npropose extensions to COSARA by introducing multiple\nautonomic control loops. The reactive control loop takes\nan immediate action when slow data query executions\nare detected. In the deliberative control loop the deci-\nsion to act is evaluated in an anomaly detection algorithm\nwith detection of anomalies in the execution times of data\nretrievals. Anomalies are also predicted in the reflective\ncontrol loop by detecting temporal periods with slow per-\nformance. A detailed analysis has been performed based\non real-life data logs from the COSARA platform in the\nICU of Ghent University Hospital. This article is struc-\ntured as follows. In Section \u2018Related work\u2019, an overview of\nautonomic computing architectures is presented and spe-\ncific models from the health care domain are explored.\nThe problem of managing COSARA data queries is thor-\noughly explained in Section \u2018Problem statement\u2019. The\nextended architecture of the COSARA service platform\nis presented in Section \u2018Architecture\u2019. Section \u2018Design of\nFOCALE-based control loops in the COSARA architecture\u2019\ndescribes the multiple control loops, which enhance per-\nformance of data queries. This includes a reactive loop,\na deliberative loop that takes a decision by executing\nan anomaly detection algorithm and a reflective con-\ntrol loop that takes a proactive approach by detecting\ntemporal patterns. Subsequently, the optimizations are\nevaluated in detail in Section \u2018Results and discussion\u2019.\nFinally, Section \u2018Conclusions\u2019 presents the conclusions of\nthis paper.\nRelated work\nAlthough autonomic management has received attention\nin enterprise wide network platforms, only a limited num-\nber of studies apply autonomicmanagement to health care\nplatforms. In this section we examine related work in both\ndomains.\nAutonomicmanagement in health care\nAutonomic computing has already been applied in body\narea networks in health care. On-body sensors moni-\ntor the patient\u2019s vital functions such as heartbeat, body\ntemperature or electrocardiogram (ECG) in a body area\nnetwork and transmit the signals to a processing unit.\nSince this equipment is hard to maintain by its develop-\ners, the system should adapt automatically to changes. The\ntelemonitoring applications that use continuous mon-\nitoring of patients\u2019 health conditions require the self-\nmanagement ability that autonomic systems propose [3].\nIn [4], an event service for autonomic management sup-\nport for e-health systems is proposed using Self-managed\ncells (SMCs). SMCs are autonomic systems that are able\nto add or remove components, detect failures of sensors\nautomatically and adapt the system. In [5], it is described\nas an architectural pattern to provide Autonomic Man-\nagement of Ubiquitous e-health Systems (AMUSE). The\nsystem needs to be self-configuring and self-managing\nwith limited user interaction and autonomously adapts\nto changes in user activity, device failure and service\naddition. The SMC consists of an event bus, for com-\nmunication between devices and management services, a\ndiscovery service and policy service [4]. The policy service\nspecifies the adaptation strategy (adaptation, authoriza-\ntion policies and event-condition-action rules) whereas\nthe discovery service implements the protocol to search\nand integrate new devices in the SMC and maintains the\nconnections. Changes in the environment are indicated\nby events, which trigger policies in the policy service\nand hence perform the action [6]. In the used publish-\nsubscribe mechanism, messages are published on the\nevent bus and delivered to its subscribers, instead of\ndirectly delivering the message. In the VESTA system, the\nAMUSE system is extendedwith security support and pol-\nicy management for authentication and access control [6].\nIn [7], an autonomic model for the management of health\ncare applications has been presented, adopting the MAPE\ncontrol loop. This control loop consists of monitor, anal-\nyse, plan and execute phases and interacts with a knowl-\nedge layer. The model has been used to assure process\nquality of the medical information system and as supervi-\nsor of the compliance of medical decisions with the pro-\ntocols [7]. It has been applied for the treatment planning\nof diabetes. The prediction service in this system, which\npredicts the patient\u2019s diagnosis using multiple regression,\nis implemented as a web service. Autonomic computing\nSteurbaut et al. BMCMedical Informatics and DecisionMaking 2013, 13:120 Page 3 of 18\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/13/120\nhas also been applied in the hospital\u2019s emergency depart-\nment to maintain optimal quality of service and optimize\nperformance of operations [8]. These departments suf-\nfer from a high workload due to an increased demand\non health resources and a limited clinicians staff. Sen-\nsors monitor the state of the environment (for example by\nusing optical sensors, radio-frequency identifiers (RFIDs)\nand counters for people and workload). However, related\nwork in papers covering autonomic health care mainly\nconcentrates on the architectural models. To the authors\nbest knowledge, no previous studies have been conducted\nwhich design, implement and evaluate autonomic con-\ntrol loops in the intensive care, with the aim to increase\nperformance of data retrievals.\nAutonomic architectures\nAutonomic architectures have been applied in industry\nsystems to find early indications of failures and to inves-\ntigate fault causes. The MAGNETO project [9](2010)\nfocuses on probabilistic fault diagnosis to find the cause\nof service problems, such as service degradation and ser-\nvice breakdowns, in home area networks. The causes\nof network failures and observed network variables are\nmodeled in a bayesian network which can infer the prob-\nability of the cause of a service failure. Several initiatives\nfor building autonomic network architectures have been\ninvestigated in [10], consisting of hierarchical architec-\ntures, flat autonomic architectures and self-organizing\nnetworks. One of the hierarchical architectures is the\nAutonomic Internet project (AutoI) which deals with the\nautonomic management for the future internet in which\nautonomic management is applied to the management\nof virtual resources. The Component-ware for Auto-\nnomic, Situation-aware Communications, and Dynam-\nically Adaptable Services (CASCADAS) deals with the\ndevelopment of an autonomic framework for creating,\nexecuting, and provisioning situation-aware and dynam-\nically adaptable communication services [11]. In [12], an\nanomaly detection framework was proposed to provide\ntechniques to analyze and detect anomalies in runtime\ndata of cloud systems by applying (i) data transformation,\n(ii) feature selection, (iii) outlier detection. Anomalies or\noutliers are patterns in data that do not conform to a\nwell defined notion of normal behavior [13]. Detection\ntechniques have been developed to find these patterns\nwhich often represent exceptions, indications of system\nfailure or interesting data which should lead to actions.\nAnomaly detection has been used in a variety of domains\nsuch as fraud detection of credit cards, fault detection\nin safety critical systems, insurance or health care, mili-\ntary surveillance using a diversity of techniques such as\nstatistical methods, data mining, machine learning [13].\nRabatel et al. [14] addressed the problem of maintaining\ncomplex systems through preventive maintenance which\ndetects abnormal behavior though collecting sensor data\nand analysis and found that these anomalies may lead to\nfailure. In our case, we want to detect low data query\nperformance.\nControl loops\nThe core of an autonomic system is the Autonomic Man-\nager (AM) which includes one or more control loops that\nmonitor the resources, analyze the data to determine if the\nstatus is normal or if adaptations are needed. If actions are\nneeded, these are planned and executed. This type of con-\ntrol loop maps the sequence: Monitor, Analyze, Plan and\nExecute (MAPE), as introduced by IBM [1]. Since the orig-\ninal proposal of autonomic computing by IBM several new\ncontrol loops have been proposed extending the MAPE\ncontrol loop. One of the most widely used set of control\nloops is those of the FOCALE architecture. The FOCALE\nautonomic architecture (Foundation - Observe - Compare -\nAct - Learn - rEason) consists of advanced control loops\nwith extended capabilities for knowledge use and learn-\ning [15]. The FOCALE control loops have served as basis\nfor the CASCADAS architecture and have been success-\nfully applied to, amongst others, fault management [16]\nand management of the home network [17]. Because of\nits popularity, we use the FOCALE control loops as the\nbasis of our autonomic manager and discuss its details\nin the remainder of this section. The FOCALE control\nloops are shown in Figure 1. The components in FOCALE\nare connected by an enterprise service bus (ESB), an\nevent-driven message broker that supports different types\nof knowledge and performs processing before delivery.\nFOCALE uses a combination of information/data mod-\nels and ontologies [15]. The FOCALE control loops are\nformed by running through a number of steps. In the\nObserve step, monitored observations are retrieved and\nfed to a model-based translation process of the Normal-\nize step. The process facilitates the translation of device\nspecific information into a normalized form. This normal-\nized data is then analyzed to determine the current state\nof the system. Subsequently the current state is compared\nto the desired state of the system in the Compare step. In\nthe Reason step, a reasoning algorithm evaluates the deci-\nsions and in the Learn step future predictions are made.\nFOCALE features several dynamic control loops, which\ncan be classified into three categories that also resem-\nble actions identified in mental concepts of the human\nbrain [18]. More specifically, FOCALE allows to define\nthree different types of control loops that each have an\nincreasing level of cognitive capabilities. Reactive control\nloops take immediate responses based on external stim-\nuli. They react in order to carry out one or multiple goals.\nAdditionally, shortcuts can be taken in order to perform\nhigh-priority and urgent tasks. The reactive control loops\nrun at the highest frequency and circumvent the decide,\nSteurbaut et al.

FOCALE features several dynamic control loops: reactive, deliberative and reflective control loops. The\ncontrol loop is formed by the following steps: Observe, Normalize, Compare, Decide, Act, Reason and Learn. The different types of control loops are\nshown on the figure. The reactive control loop takes immediate action based on external observations. The deliberative control loop uses long and\nshort memory to create an action plan. The reflective control loop uses the learning component to take preventive actions in the future.\nreason and learn components. Deliberative control loops\nreceive data from and can send commands to the reactive\nprocesses. They use long and short termmemory to create\nmore elaborate plans of action. The deliberative loops run\nat a lower frequency and circumvent the learning com-\nponent. Finally, the reflective control loops supervise the\ndeliberative processes. They study decisions made in the\npast, and analyse them. The conclusions are then used to\nprevent sub-optimal actions from being taken again in the\nfuture. The reflective loops run at the lowest frequency.\nThe major advantage of the above described FOCALE\ncognitive control loop approach is its high variety in\noffered pro-activeness. As it consists of multiple control\nloops with different characteristics (reactive, deliberative\nand reflective) urgent tasks can be a less complex con-\ntrol loop (e.g., a reactive variant) and iteratively improved\nlater on by a more complex control loop (i.e., a deliber-\native or reflective control loop). The FOCALE cognitive\ncontrol loops have mainly seen an implementation in\nthe area of network and service management. In previ-\nous work, we applied it to manage multimedia services\nby extending it with semantic capabilities [19]. In this\nwork, the focus was on combining different elements to\njointly manage a service such as the streaming of multi-\nmedia in a computer network. Choi et al. have embedded\nthe FOCALE control loop in their HiMang architecture\n[20]. Their focus is more on the architectural aspect\nof the FOCALE architecture and less on the algorith-\nmic implementations of the different control loops: they\ninvestigate the integration with policies and information\nmodels. Moreover their application domain is different\nto our approach as they study cloud-based networks,\nQuality of Service management and fault management.\nKim et al. have implemented the FOCALE control loops\nto manage OpenFlow-based networks (i.e., the protocol\nthat steers the Software-Defined Networking paradigm)\n[21]. Their solution uses the FOCALE control loops to\nallow setting up and maintaining paths in OpenFlow,\neven if unexpected link failures occur. Their approach\nfocuses on maintaining datapath connectivity, while our\napproach has query optimization and management as pri-\nmary goal. For this reason, the algorithmic approach is\ncompletely different. The same authors have also imple-\nmented the FOCALE control loops to prioritize and\ngroup alarms raised by a network management system\n[16]. As this corresponds with a classification problem,\nit is more related to our approach. However, we use a\nsemi-supervised learning approach through an anomaly\ndetection algorithm, while they propose a more static\nrule-based approach.\nControl theory approaches to query optimization\nIn this article, we propose an autonomic management\napproach to query optimization in a health information\nsystem. We present anomaly detection based algorithms\nthat implement the aforementioned FOCALE cognitive\ncontrol loops. The concept of control loops stem from\ncontrol theory [22], which is a paradigm that allows to\ndynamically manage a system based the maximization of\nan objective and periodic or continuous feedback from\nthe managed system. In the past, control theory has been\nsuccessfully applied to many application domains (e.g.,\nresource allocation [23], web server management [24],\napplication server management [25]). Typically these con-\ntrol loop approaches try to predefined service level objec-\ntives. Parekh et al. describe a methodology for designing\ncontrol loops for managing service level objectives in\nperformance management [26]. Through the design of\na statistical model, fit to historical measurements, they\navoid requiring large and complex mathematical models.\nOur proposed system, and more specifically the reflective\nand deliberative control loops, uses the same approach:\nby detecting temporal patterns in historical data opti-\nmal actions are learned without requiring a model of the\ncomplete system. Hellerstein et al. also introduced the\nconcept of such a statistical approach to predict future\nSteurbaut et al. BMCMedical Informatics and DecisionMaking 2013, 13:120 Page 5 of 18\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/13/120\ndemands of software systems (e.g., a Web Server) [27].\nOur approach extends this idea and introduces different\nlevels of learnings.\nOptimization of query processing often re-uses con-\ncepts of control theory and has mainly been studied in\nthe context of grids [28]. More recently, with the grow-\ning attention towards Big Data, new application domains\nof this research have been found [29]. These approaches\ntypically focus on large scale and distributed databases. As\nsuch, they are complementary to our approach as they can\nbe used if the scale of the database system itself increases\n(e.g., introducing a higher level of replication). Also in\nthe area of query optimization, dynamic management\napproaches have been proposed. Paton et al. [30] propose\nan adaptive query processing algorithmwith the same goal\nas our approach: reducing the overall response times of\nquery processing. They focus mainly on the joint opti-\nmization of multiple queries as they are often grouped,\nrequested by a single user. Park et al. present an approach\nwhere queries consisting of multiple joins are optimized\n[31]. Their main approach consists of developing mul-\ntiple candidate processing plans and only selecting the\nbest plan after some initial pre-processing steps. Avnur\net al. focus on adaptive query processing in large-scale\nand federated databases [32] by continuously reorder-\ning joins inside a single query based on the observed -\nand highly dynamic - response times of subqueries in\nsuch a federated database. The above approaches can\nbe seen as complementary solutions to our approach as\nthey focus on the optimization of specific queries. As\nsuch, they investigate the structure of each query but\nare agnostic to the application demands regarding these\nqueries. Instead, we focus on the application demands\nand allow the application to prioritize the queries based\non the application logic and user expectations. By dis-\nabling less important queries we can already considerably\nimprove the response time. This response time could\neven be improved further by applying the aforementioned\ntechniques.\nMore generally speaking, the problem investigated in\nthis article relates to dynamic scheduling in a resource\nconstrained environment. In this area, several well-known\ntechniques exist for scheduling requests (in our case:\nqueries) such as earliest deadline first, first come first\nserved, etc. We refer to the work of Suresh et al. for a com-\nplete survey of these approaches [33]. Also in grids [34]\nand, more recently, cloud systems [35] job and applica-\ntion scheduling algorithms have been successfully applied.\nThese techniques typically have a very broad applica-\ntion domain but also often parameters to be set (e.g., the\ndeadline of every request). In our approach, these tech-\nniques can be used as an alternative to the current applied\noptimization action: the disablement of less important\nqueries. We chose not to use these actions as we observed\nlittle effect in performance compared to a higher complex-\nity in the configuration of the algorithm.\nIn summary, compared to the current state of the art,\nour approach is novel for the following reasons. First, the\nadopted three-layer approach, inspired by the FOCALE\ncognitive control loops, provides an important flexibility\nin the level of proactiveness that can be achieved. Com-\npared to other data management approaches, we are able\nto quickly react to local problems and at the same time\ncarry out more complex optimizations on a larger time\nscale. Second, to the best of the authors\u2019s knowledge, our\napproach is the first that implements these control loops\nfor data management. As such, the proposed anomaly\ndetection algorithms and their integration with the three\ndifferent loops, are completely novel and fundamentally\ndifferent from previous approaches, which focused more\non network and service management.\nMethods\nProblem statement\nThe COSARA platform is a platform for infection surveil-\nlance and antibiotic management in the intensive care [2].\nIt is being used by physicians and nurses at the ICU of\nGhent University Hospital, as part of the clinical work-\nflow. COSARA is designed as a service oriented architec-\nture and manages the antibiotic consumption and infec-\ntion related information in the ICU [2]. The COSARA\nsystem collects data from the laboratory, the clinical infor-\nmation system, and its own historical COSARA-database,\nprocesses these data, and presents the information or\nmedical advice on a bedside computer, desktop at the\nphysician\u2019s office or at a mobile device.\nThemost frequently consulted data on the bedside com-\nputers consists of the patient\u2019s clinical values and the\nmicrobiology results in this ICU. COSARA has a module\noffering a clinical overview with the values of tempera-\nture, white bloodcell count (WBC), thrombocytes, organ\nfailure score, and prescribed antibiotics, and a module\ngiving all microbiology results (samples with cultures,\nantibiogram and blood analyses). The COSARA system is\ndesigned in such a way that each time a physician or nurse\nrequests the clinical values of a patient, all necessary infor-\nmation is requested through a series of queries (called a\nquery group). This typically results in a burst of queries,\neach time a patient record is requested.\nBesides these queries who feed the displayed modules,\nother COSARA queries update data in the background.\nOn an average day, approximately 2 million COSARA\nqueries are executed, with an average of approximately\n85,000 queries per hour. The growing popularity of the\nCOSARA application affects the data response times in\nthe client. With more queries being executed simultane-\nously, the execution time of data retrievals increases and\ndelays are noticed. This is illustrated in Figure 2, which\nSteurbaut et al.

As shown, the highest peaks of the\n98th percentile show execution times of 182 s, 162 s and\n59 s in a 60 minutes time frame, whereas average execu-\ntion times are observed around 27 s execution time. As\nphysicians depend on the application to support their clin-\nical decision, high delays have to be prevented. The human\noperator is unable to guard the execution of the 150 dif-\nferent query types in the COSARA database. Therefore,\npotential delays in the data retrieval should be prevented\nautonomously by system components.\nArchitecture\nThe system should identify, manage and thus prevent\nthe performance issues autonomously by reacting quickly\non behavior changes in the system components. These\nchanges can result, for example, from high utilization\nor an increased frequency of data retrievals. To make\nappropriate and reliable decisions, the concern is to pos-\nsess data that is accurate enough, timely enough and\nconsistent enough [36]. Figure 3 illustrates the domain\nwhere autonomic management is applied in health care:\n(i) the data management of timely bedside procedures\nand (ii) the management of data retrieval and process-\ning. The COSARA service-oriented architecture consists\nof layers for presentation, business processing and data\npersistence [2]. We extended the architecture with com-\nponents, as shown in Figure 4. The client is designed in\na modular way (Modules and Module Manager) using\nthe OSGi technology as basis. Modules can be added,\nremoved or updated on all bedside clients by chang-\ning the configuration on the server. Both in client and\nplatform services, monitoring and logging components\nare added in order to be able to track the state of bed-\nside client and server-side components. The Data Lookup\nService (DLS), which forms the interface towards the data\nsources, is extended with a statistics component. The DLS\nlogs every data access and includes the invocation time,\nthe logical query name and the query\u2019s execution time\n(in milliseconds). The DLS executes all queries (antibi-\notics, laboratory, microbiology, infection-related queries)\non the different data sources (the laboratory database\nGLIMS, the intensive care information system (ICIS) or\nthe COSARA database). The autonomic analyzer ensures\nthat the monitored data and logs are examined dynam-\nically (as detailed in the control loops). In the iterative\ndesign and evaluation of COSARA, we already started\nwith the addition of recovery tools and limited detection\nmechanisms, but the loop was not closed and the human\nadministrator had to take action. The analyzer now\ndetects performance decreases in the execution of queries\nand instructs the Controller-Anticipator to respond and\nadapt the query executions autonomously to optimize the\nquality of service. In the implemented control loops, the\nController-Anticipator responds by temporarily disabling\nless important queries, which are typically part of the\nquery group stemming from a physician\u2019s or nurse request\nfor a patient record or background queries.\nFigure 5 illustrates how this functional architecture is\nmapped to the physical infrastructure. As shown, the busi-\nness logic, deployed at the application server responds\nto user queries and/or background tasks (e.g., periodic\nmaintenance). This results in the execution of a series of\nqueries, which are forwarded to the different databases,\nvia the controller. Each query execution has a certain\nresponse time. These response times are monitored and\naggregated: for each query execution the delay before\nSteurbaut et al.

The particular problem\ntackled in this manuscript, however, has to deal with long\npeak periods. As during peak periods, new high prior-\nity queries are constantly being introduced, low-priority\nqueries are continously ignored, until their relevance\nbecomes obsolete. As a result, their execution becomes\nuseless and the effect is similar to action we chose,\nwhich is disabling the less important queries from the\nstart.\nQuery selection process\nAs described above, the approach presented in this arti-\ncle aims at reducing the response times of queries during\npeak hours in the COSARA architecture by temporarily\ndisabling less important queries. A first step in achieving\nthis is the selection of queries, which have lower prior-\nity for the users of the COSARA system. This requires\ndomain knowledge about the application. In this section,\nwe first describe how this knowledge is modelled and\nsubsequently present an algorithm for selecting candidate\nqueries.\nKnowledgemodel\nWe model the domain knowledge of the COSARA appli-\ncation using RDFa, which is a standardized model for data\ninterchange. One advantage of RDF is that models for\nwell-known and generic concepts are available in RDF or\nthe ontology language OWLb, which uses RDF-based seri-\nalization. For this reason, we re-use existing models for\nincorporating the relevant knowledge as much as possible.\nMore specifically, we use the IntelLEO Workflow\nontologyc to model how users and background pro-\ncesses interact with the COSARA system. The IntelLEO\nWorkflow ontology defines concepts such as roles and\nusers, and allows defining a sequence of activities and\ntasks. As will be described below, this is used to define\nthe clinical decision process of the users in combination\nwith the COSARA system. In defining these workflows,\nwe often need to refer to medical terminology. Therefore,\nwe use the Galen ontology [37], which defines this ter-\nminology and their links. Finally, we need to model the\napplication specific knowledge linked with the COSARA\napplication (e.g., which queries are executed when). We\ndo this by linking newly defined concepts to the tasks and\nactivities defined in the workflow. More specifically, we\nallow a task to refer to a set of queries: each query can have\nsubqueries and has attributes such as a value defining its\ncomplexity and priority.\nFigure 6 provides an example of how the knowledge is\nmodelled for the COSARA application. For the sake of\nreadability, we only show the link with the workflows and\nqueries, not with the Galen ontology. Here we defined\ntwo workflows: one periodic activity belonging to a back-\nground process in the application and one patient spe-\ncific activity, which is carried out by a COSARA user\n(either a physician or nurse). The periodic activity con-\nsists of several maintenance tasks, which are sequentially\nexecuted. Each task has its own query, with multiple\nsubqueries (not shown in the figure). As these are mainte-\nnance task, their priority is small (note that a high priority\nSteurbaut et al.

This figure shows an example of how domain knowledge about the COSARA application, and more specifically the\ninteraction between workflow and query optimization, is modeled in our approach. Two illustrative workflows are shown: one corresponding with\nan automated background process and one corresponding with a sequence of activities carried out by a COSARA user.\nvalue, corresponds to a low priority). The user-triggered\nactivity details how a user accesses microbiology results\nin the COSARA application. The user is first shown a\nsummarized view on the patient\u2019s details. To create this\nview several queries are required. The user then has the\noption to eithermodify the patient\u2019s details (after which he\nreturns to the patient overview) or to get an overview of\nthe microbiology details. This microbiology activity con-\nsists of one mandatory task (with several queries required\nto create this view) and one optional task, which performs\nthe analysis of the results.\nIdentification of candidate queries for disablement\nIn this section, we present an assisted algorithm for iden-\ntifying less important queries. The algorithm ranks the\ndifferent queries in the COSARA system based on their\nimportance for the users. This ranking is then given to an\nadministrator as an aid in selecting the queries that can be\ndisabled when a scarcity in resources occur.\nOverall, the ranking is done based on three factors\n(i) the visibility of the queries in the application, (ii)\nthe query\u2019s complexity and (iii) the importance of the\nqueries in the clinical decision process. The algorithm\nprovides a formal implementation of a manual heuristic,\nwhich was initially carried out by the administrator of the\nCOSARA system. An overview of the algorithm is given in\nAlgorithm 1. As shown, the algorithm iterates on all dif-\nferent activities and corresponding tasks and queries in\nthe workflow. Each query is given an initial rank of 1,\nwhich corresponds to the highest importance. However,\nseveral factors can increase the rank value (i.e., lower the\nquery\u2019s importance). For example, background processes\nand optional activities or tasks are penalized with a factor\n(PenaltyNonUser, PenaltyOptionalActivity and Penalty-\nOptionalTask, respectively). Moreover, high complexity\nand priority values further increase the rank value. The set\nof queries and their according rank are stored, sorted and\nfinally presented to the administrator for revision. The\nquery selection process only determines the order of the\nqueries and leaves it up to the administrator to select the\nactual queries for disablement.\nAlgorithm 1 Algorithmic details of the query selection\nprocess.\n1: queries \u2190 \u03c6\n2: activities \u2190 getAllActivities()\n3: for all activity \u2208 activities do\n4: rank \u2190 1\n5: if activity.assignedToRole == BackgroundProcess\nthen\n6: rank \u2190 rank \u00d7 PenaltyNonUser\n7: if activity.type == Optional then\n8: rank \u2190 rank \u00d7 PenaltyOptionalActivity\n9: for all task \u2208 activity.tasks do\n10: if task.type == Optional then\n11: rank \u2190 rank \u00d7 PenaltyOptionalTask\n12: for all query \u2208 task.queries do\n13: qrank \u2190 rank \u00d7 query.complexity\n14: qrank \u2190 qrank \u00d7 query.priority\n15: queries \u2190 queries + {query\u2192qrank}\n16: sort(queries)\n17: return queries\nSteurbaut et al.

The goal of all three control\nloops is to keep the response time of a query group below\na threshold, which corresponds with an acceptable delay.\nNote that the quantization of an acceptable delay is a sub-\njective matter as it relates to how the users of the system\nperceive it quality (i.e., the so called Quality of Experience).\nFurthermore, what is acceptable also depends both on\nthe type of application and type of operation performed\n(i.e., the type of query group). For our COSARA system,\nan acceptable delay for the most occurring query group\n(i.e., the microbiology query group) is up to approximately\n25 seconds. This value was determined through discus-\nsions with the users of the COSARA system and based on\ntheir day-to-day experience with the system.\nPerformance is monitored via a statistics component in\nthe data lookup service (DLS) which stores the execu-\ntion time for each query. By analyzing the execution time\nand deciding when a serious performance delay occurs,\nother queries can be disabled temporarily to ensure faster\nretrieval of patient\u2019s data in the displayed client mod-\nule. The method to decide and take action differs in the\nthree presented control loops. Figure 7 depicts the activ-\nities of each control loop as explained below. Reactive\ncontrol loops take immediate actions based on immedi-\nately perceived external stimuli, while the deliberative and\nreflective loops feature an increased level of learning: the\nfirst based on anomaly detection, while the later focuses\non the clustering and detection of temporal patterns. We\ndescribe the details of all three loops in the remainder of\nthis section.\nReactive control loop\nThe goal of the reactive control loop is to detect the occur-\nrence of a large disruption of the system. Only if the per-\nformance of the system is severely affected, an immediate\naction is taken corresponding with the disablement of less\nimportant queries. As such, the reactive control loop con-\ntinuously monitors the delay of page loads, as observed by\nthe physician, in the COSARA application. To do this, the\nexecution times of all all queries in the DLS component\nare monitored (FOCALE\u2019s monitor step) and summed to a\ntotal delay as several queries will be responsible for a single\npage load (observe step). When this total delay is unac-\nceptably high, denoted by the threshold treactive, an alarm\nis raised in the control loop (Compare step). The effect of\nthis alarm is the following: on one hand the administrator\ngets notified of the data problem to allow him to have a\ncloser look of the root cause of the anomaly. On the other\nhand, an automatic action is also taken to ensure a grace-\nful degradation of the system. Therefore, the automatic\nexecution of a subset of queries, corresponding to less\nimportant data retrievals (e.g., cron jobs, side informa-\ntion) is disabled for a time window Wreactive. As the total\nnumber of queries will decrease, the goal of the reactive\ncontrol loop is to considerably reduce the overall per-\nceived delay. For example, to improve the execution of\nmicrobiology samples, redundant queries of urine sedi-\nment are disabled because these queries are not shown in\nthe module. If the physician wants to consult this urine\nvalue, a warning informs him that the query is disabled\ntemporarily. The physician can retrieve the value by click-\ning a request button, in which case the value is retrieved\nusing a duplicate urine sediment query (which can only\nbe executed on request and is not filtered). As these urine\nsediment queries will only be executed when the data is\nactually required by the physician, the number of queries\nwill be considerably reduced.\nDeliberative control loop\nIn the deliberative control loop, decisions and actions are\nmade using an anomaly detection algorithm. In this loop\nthere is an explicit evaluation of the decision before act-\ning. This control loop continuously monitors the query\nexecution time of each individual query and groups them\naccording to the query type. Note that, in contrast to\nthe reactive control loop, the monitoring occurs based on\nMonitor DLS\nStatistics (query\nexecution time)\nCompare\nexecution time\nof queries\nAnomaly\nDetection\nAlgorithm\nReactive Deliberative\nPredict\nAnomaly\nTime Windows\nExecute\nAction\nReflective\nFigure 7 Activities in the control flows for performance optimization.

The figure shows the three control loop types.\nSteurbaut et al.

By monitoring each query type, a specific\nmodel is built that represents the typical expected query\nexecution time of each query type. Based on this model,\nan anomaly detection algorithm can detect out of profile\nbehaviour, i.e., outliers. If the share of recently detected\noutliers becomes abnormally high, a similar query disable-\nment action as carried out in the reactive control loop\nis executed. Queries are proactively disabled when a dis-\nruption of the system is likely to occur (i.e., signalled by\nan increased share of abnormal individual query execu-\ntions). This is in contrast to the reactive control loop\nwhere queries are disabled after a system disruption is\ndetected. Therefore, the deliberative control loop detects\npatterns that typically occur just before a shortage of\nresources (leading to high response times) and enforces\na pro-active disablement of queries to avoid the resource\nshortage. Additionally the deliberative control loop incor-\nporated knowledge from a domain expert to detect the\noutliers. As such, the control loop consists of a training\nphase, where the system is trained to build the model\nand detect outliers, and a deployment phase, where the\noutliers are detected on-line and appropriate actions are\ntaken. We discuss the algorithmic details of both phases\nin the remainder of this section.\nTraining phase During the training phase, a model is\nbuilt for each query type based on knowledge from a\ndomain expert. This is shown in Figure 8. In a first step, a\nhistorical data set D containing the query execution times\nand query types over the course of a day is labeled by the\ndomain expert (e.g., the system operator). The goal of the\nlabelling is to select a subset Dnormal corresponding with\nnormal query execution times for each query type. Conse-\nquently, the subsetDoutlier \u2261 D\\Dnormal corresponds with\nabnormal or out of profile query executions. In a second\nstep, a random subset Dtrain \u2282 Dnormal is taken as train-\ning set. In our case, we take 85% of random samples out\nofDnormal. Based onDtrain, a model can be built of normal\nquery execution times by calculating the mean and stan-\ndard deviation of the population in Dtrain. These values\nare then used to determine whether a random sample x\nof query execution times belongs to the calculated model\nor not. To do this, a z-score is calculated, which is a well\nknown anomaly detection algorithm, as follows:\nz(x) = |x \u2212 \u03bc(Dtrain)|\n\u03c3(Dtrain)\n(1)\nHere, \u03bc(Dtrain) denotes the mean of Dtrain, while\n\u03c3(Dtrain) is the standard deviation ofDtrain. The larger the\ncalculated z-score is, the more likely the sample x is to\nbe an outlier. However, it is difficult to define a threshold\nfor this as this depends on the distribution of the dataset,\nwhich is unknown. To address this, in a third and final\nstep, the remaining dataset Dtest \u2261 D \\ Dtrain is used for\ndetermining a threshold zt . Based on this threshold, a ran-\ndom sample x can be classified as an outlier (if z(x) > zt)\nor not. Note that Doutlier \u2282 Dtest : hence, Dtest will con-\ntain both normal and out of profile query execution times.\nFor each x \u2208 Dtest , the z-score as defined in Equation\n(1) is calculated. Furthermore, for several possible values\nof zt , the samples x are classified and the classification\nis compared with the labelling of Doutlier and Dnormal by\nthe domain expert. By comparing the classification for a\ngiven zt parameter configuration and the classification by\nthe domain expert, the best zt parameter configuration\ncan be chosen. More specifically, we select the zt param-\neter that maximises the precision and recall values, two\nmetrics that are used to assess the accuracy of a classi-\nfication system.

BMCMedical Informatics and DecisionMaking 2013, 13:120 Page 12 of 18\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/13/120\ntrue positives (i.e. the number of true outliers) divided\nby the total number of elements belonging to the posi-\ntive/outliers class (i.e. the number of detected outliers by\nthe algorithm, and also including those that were listed as\noutlier but are not observed outlier). Recall is defined as\nthe number of true positives divided by the total number\nof elements observed as outlier (i.e. the number of out-\nliers that were detected, and also including those that were\nmissed by the outlier detection). The result of the training\nphase is (i) a model for each query type, defined through\nthe mean and standard deviation of a population of that\ntype, that defines the normal behaviour of query execution\ntimes for that query type and (ii) a threshold zt for each\nquery type that can be used to perform an on-line outlier\ndetection in the deployment phase.\nDeployment phase Once trained, the calculated model\nand threshold can be used to detect the occurrence of\noutliers on-line for each query type and act accordingly.\nTherefore, the deliberative control loop will continuously\nmonitor the query execution times for each individual\nquery and will classify each execution time as being nor-\nmal or out profile according to the trained configuration.\nNext, the share of outliers compared to the total set of\nqueries in the last time window Wdelib is continuously\ncalculated. If the calculated share exceeds a predefined\nthreshold soutlier , the deliberative control loop assumes\nthat there is a high risk of system degradation. As a reac-\ntion, it decides to execute actions that can reduce the\ntypical query execution times (e.g., disabling other queries\nas discussed in Section \u2018Identification of candidate queries\nfor disablement\u2019.\nReflective control loop\nIn the reflective control loop, the long term memory is\ntaken into account to take proactive actions (i.e, before\nthe execution of the actual queries). The reflective loop\ndetects temporal patterns in the occurrence of outliers\nand proactively disables low priority queries. In practice,\nthe COSARA system often experiences quality degrada-\ntions during peak periods (e.g., at the beginning and end of\nthe work day of physicians). The goal of the reflective con-\ntrol loop is to autonomically detect these peak periods and\ndisable the queries accordingly. Therefore, the reflective\ncontrol loop has a similar goal as the deliberative control\nloop: it proactively disables queries to avoid high response\ntimes. The main difference is that the reflective control\nloop focuses on diurnal effects (i.e., patterns that can be\nobserved on a daily basis) and disables queries for a longer\ntime period (i.e., at least 30 minutes) based on detected\nhistorical patterns on a very long time frame (i.e., several\nweeks).\nThe reflective control loop works as follows. Based on\nthe data setDoutlier , constructed in the deliberative control\nloop using the z-score-based anomaly detection algo-\nrithm, a new data setDrefl is derived. As discussed,Doutlier\ncontains all queries (with their response time and time of\nexecution information), which are identified by the delib-\nerative control loop of having abnormally high execution\ntimes (i.e., being outliers).\nBased on this set of outliers, the data set Drefl denotes\nthe frequency of outliers given the current time of day.\nTo determine the frequency, we use bins of correspond-\ning to a 30 minute time window. Hence, Drefl contains 48\nelements. Note that, two outliers occurring on complete\ndifferent days but on the same time of day will be assigned\nto the same bin. The relevance of this newly constructed\ndata set is the following: we observed that peak periods\noften occur at the moment in time across days. This is\nbecause the physicians and nurses often use the COSARA\nsystem, as part of their routine, at the same time each day.\nThe typical busy hours every day correspondwith the start\nand end of every working day as well as the lunch break\n(around noon).\nBy deriving the data set Drefl we can identify the afore-\nmentioned busy hours, as they will correspond with a\nhigh number of outliers in Doutlier and thus in large val-\nues for the frequency in that time zone. In order to detect\nthe highest values, we apply the same anomaly detection\nalgorithm as discussed above: we calculate the z-score as\nwell as the optimal z-score threshold and classify a time\nwindow as an outlier if its z-score is above the defined\nthreshold. This process is illustrated in Figure 9.\nIn this context, the detection of an outlier signifies\na time window of 30 minutes, where the deliberative\ncontrol loop has found an abnormal amount of high\nresponse times. Hence, this builds further on the knowl-\nedge learned in the previous control loop. If such a time\nwindow is identified as an outlier, the queries are disabled\nduring that time window. This is done pro-actively on\nevery day in the future, until the reflective control loop no\nlonger flags this as a busy period.\nResults and discussion\nIn this section we study the influence of the actions of the\nFOCALE based reactive and deliberative control loops on\nthe query execution time. The executed queries of a ran-\ndom day in January 2012 were taken and executed again in\na test environment, as described in the evaluation setup.\nThe duration of each COSARA query was measured. In\nthese experiments we evaluated the impact of an imme-\ndiate action in reactive control loop, the decision to take\naction by the described anomaly detection algorithm in\nthe deliberative loop and its impact.\nEvaluation setup\nThe COSARA platform is set up in the real life produc-\ntion environment of the Ghent University Hospital.

For executing the query selection process, we set the\npenalty parameters PenaltyUser, PenaltyOptionalActivity\nand PenaltyOptionalTask to 10, 5 and 3, respectively. The\nUrineSediment queries retrieve the urine sediment value.\nThe Identification queries retrieve changes made to the\nidentification. Both queries are not important when the\nphysician is actually displaying the patients\u2019 microbiology.\nThe results include the average query execution time of\nthe query executions. These percentiles show the worst\nexecution times. These executions cause delay on the\nphysicians screen while displaying microbiology samples.\nThe experiments were carried out on one core Intel Xeon\nE5620 processor with 2.40 GHz and 3.0 GB RAM. We\nemulated the client and server interaction by replicat-\ning the COSARA queries of the trace log. As such, it\nshows behavior identical to the query executions in pro-\nduction environment. Figure 10 shows the test setup.\nOn the server node a MySQL database server 5.0.51 is\nrunning and on the client node we rerun the real exe-\ncuted queries and measure its execution time and the\nimprovements by the actions in the presented control\nloops.\nPerformance evaluation of the control loops\nPerformance evaluation of the reactive control loop\nIn the reactive control loop an action is immediately taken\nif the performance is severely affected. We set parameter\ntreactive to 90,000 ms and parameter Wreactive to 2 min-\nutes. The value treactive corresponds to the execution time,\nwhich is considered very obstructive by the COSARA\nuser. It is expected that similar high execution times are\nFigure 10 Setup of COSARA client and server on nodes of the generic test environment. The generic test environment consists of an emulator\nfor the COSARA client and for the COSARA server. The client system executes the queries on the COSARA database, a MySQL database.

In the deliberative\ncontrol loop the decision and action are made using an\nanomaly detection algorithm. In this section we evaluate\nthe effect of the deliberative control loop on the query\nexecution times. First we determine the detection score\nzt , as discussed in Section \u2018Deliberative control loop\u2019.\nWe varied the score from 2 to 8. Figure 12 shows an\nexample of the determination of the anomaly detection\nscore with precision and recall (based on training set,\ndata log of January, 19, 2012). Based on this we set the\nanomaly detection score zt to 2 because of its highest pre-\ncision and recall. The figure also shows the precision and\nrecall of Dtest (log results of January, 20, 2012, the test\nset). We analysed the queries which retrieve microbiology\nsamples, cultures, antibiogram and analyses and deter-\nmined the scores. Then, we set Wdelib to a time period of\n1000 ms in which queries were executed. The parameter\nsoutlier was set to 20% to obtain the best share of outliers.\nThe action, identical to the disabling of queries in the\nreactive loop, was performed when soutlier was exceeded.\n0\n0,1\n0,2\n0,3\n0,4\n0,5\n0,6\n0,7\n0,8\n0,9\n1\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8Pr\nec\nis\nio\nn \nan\nd \nre\nca\nll \n(%\n)\nAnomaly Detection Score\nD test Recall (19-01) D test Recall (20-01)\nD test Precision (19-01) D test Precision (20-01)\nFigure 12 Example of the determination of anomaly detection score based on highest precision and recall.

The combi-\nnation of the reactive, deliberative and reflective actions\naffects the query group execution times additionally\nduring the selected time intervals.

The average\nmicrobiology query execution time is compared. The figure shows the query exeuction time of the reactive, deliberative and reflective control\nloops. It shows the affected average query execution times with the combined control loops and the baseline over 24 hours.\nDiscussion\nThe proposed solution introduces an alternative to sim-\nply increasing the amount of resources by upgrading the\nphysical infrastructure. The control loop solution is viable\nas the response times in query processing experience\nimportant peak periods during certain moments in time\n(e.g., the beginning and end of the day). Upgrading the\nphysical infrastructure to accommodate these peaks is\npossible, but at the same time costly as the infrastructure\nwould often be idle during less busy periods. As our solu-\ntion takes care of the abnormally high peaks in response\ntime, the result is a more flat behaviour of response\ntime over the day. Therefore, if the system\u2019s usage would\nincrease further, deploying alternative solutions such as\ndatabase replication in combination with our proposed\nsolution will be more advantageous.\nFigure 15 and Figure 16 summarize all the evalu-\nation results. Figure 15 compares the average query\ngroup execution times. The reactive control loop reduces\nthe average execution time by 8.61%. The combination\nof the actions of the reactive and deliberative control\nloop reduce the average execution time by 10.92%.

By disabling the\nqueries during the whole day the baseline is set. Although\nthis shows the highest possible gain, the queries COSARA\nUrineSediment and Identification are disabled completely.\nCompared to the baseline, the control loops provide a\nreduction of more than one third of the possible improve-\nment. The baseline showed a difference of 32.09% com-\npared to the average execution time without actions. We\nalso compared the effect on the 95th and 98th percentile,\nas shown in Figure 16. The reactive control loop, reac-\ntive and deliberative control loop, and reactive, delibera-\ntive and reflective show reductions of 8.79%, 11.04% and\n13.57% respectively in the 95th percentile. In the 98th per-\ncentile the execution time is reduced by 6.27%, 8.07% and\n8.50% respectively.\nOverall, the solution has a high scalability for several\nreasons. All three control loops rely on detecting peaks\nbased on summarized data. This means that the memory\nconsumption does not grow linearly with an increasing\nnumber of users of the system. Furthermore, the control\nloops introduce only amarginal overhead in terms of com-\nputational complexity. Finally, in the design of all three\nloops, care has been taken to maintain a good scalabil-\nity. For example, the reactive control loop was deliberately\nkept relatively simple in terms of computational complex-\nity and memory consumption as it needs to run at a very\nhigh frequency (i.e., in the order of seconds). Control\nloops which run on a more daily basis (e.g., the reflective\ncontrol loop) are allowed to introduce a higher complex-\nity. Note that, as the reflective control loop mainly relies\non clustering, it also has a high scalability as the number\nof users increases.\nConclusions\nThis paper presents the extension of the existing health\ncare platform COSARA in the ICU with autonomic con-\ntrol loops. The introduced control loops provide an auto-\nmated mechanism to detect low performance and to take\naction, thereby limiting human technical interventions.\nThe monitoring of the execution times of the data queries\nof this real life intensive care platform allow the inves-\ntigation of low performance. A reactive, deliberative and\nreflective control loop have been proposed to optimize\nthe data query performance and thus the page load of\nthe microbiology module. In the reactive control loop\nthe action is immediately taken when the performance of\nthe system is affected. The action disables less important\nqueries not relevant for the display of microbiology data.\nIn the deliberative control loop we use an anomaly detec-\ntion algorithm with an explicit evaluation of the decision\nbefore the action is taken. In the reflective control loop,\nproactive actions are taken after temporal patterns of out-\nliers are detected.We evaluated the impact of the reactive,\ndeliberative and reflective control loop on the query exe-\ncution of the microbiology data. The results show a time\nreduction of 8.61% by the reactive control loop on the\naverage query execution times. The addition of the delib-\nerative control loop reduced the average query execution\ntime by 10.9% and by combining the three control loops\nthe average execution time was reduced by 13.04%.\nEndnotes\na Resource Description Framework (RDF) - http://\nwww.w3.org/RDF/\nb OWLWeb Ontology Language Overview - http://\nwww.w3.org/TR/owl-features/\nc IntelLEOWorkflow ontology - http://www.intelleo.\neu/ontologies/workflow/spec/\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions\nThe work presented was carried out in collaboration between all authors.

Introduction \n \nAlready in the late 1960s and early 70s, teamwork was important in \nmanufacturing. During this period, the aim of teamwork was to im-\nprove working conditions. In West Germany, teamwork was sup-\nported by the HdA programme, a quality of working life programme \nby the Brandt-government (Auer 1988: iv). During the 1980s, team-\nwork became important again with the spread of new production \nconcepts in the German manufacturing industry (Kern/Schumann \n1984). Teamwork was meant to facilitate a more intense utilisation \nof labour. \nSince the beginning of the 1990s, teamwork has experienced another \nrevival. In opposition to the 1970s and 1980s, it now is about two \nends, improvement of working conditions and rationalisation, how-\never the latter is clearly dominating (Gerst et. al. 1994: 5).   \nOne major cause for this revival of teamwork was the MIT-study on \nthe Japanese motor-car industry (Womack et al. 1990). The authors \nexplained the world-wide success of the Japanese motor-car indus-\ntry with what they called lean production, which bases on organisa-\ntional efficiency and an intense utilisation of labour. One central \ncomponent of lean production is teamwork. \nThe motor-car industry played a key role in the \u2018sudden boom of \nteamwork\u2018 (Endres/Wehner 1993). In Germany, all major motor-car \ncompanies implemented teamwork in the early 1990s (Roth 1996a). \nIn Britain, too, most major car manufacturers adopted lean produc-\ntion methods, including teamwork, in the 1990, following the estab-\nlishment of Japanese car plants (where work practices are based on \nlean production) in the UK (IRS 1993: 5, FT 01/09/1995). \nThe models of teamwork in different car factories vary considerably, \nand so do the judgements about them. Teamwork is described as ei-\nther post- or neo-fordist, innovative or conservative, work enhanc-\ning or work controlling (cf. below). This variety of teamwork pro-\nvides the starting point for this article, which compares teamwork in \ntwo German and two British car plants. 154  European Political Economy Review  \n \n \nThe following section introduces the two research questions \u2013 \nwhether teamwork in different car factories can be categorised into \na bi-polar model of teamwork, and whether the introduction of \nteamwork brings about a development towards post-fordism. The \nthird section reviews the literature on teamwork in the automobile \nindustry, and introduces two opposite models of teamwork. The \nfourth section contains four case studies, which are compared and \nevaluated the following two sections. The seventh section concludes. \n \n2. Research  Questions \n \nThe development of teamwork in the automotive industry since the \nmid-1990s seems to be characterised by a \u2018struggle of two lines\u2019 \n(Roth 1996b), which represent two contrary \u2018conceptual poles\u2019 \n(Kuhlmann 1996: 114) of teamwork.  \nVarious German authors have attempted to conceptualise this. An-\ntoni (1994) confronts \u2018partly autonomous teams\u2019 with \u2018production \nteams\u2019, Roth (1996b) talks about self-organised and taylorised \nteamwork, while Gerst et al. (1995) contrast innovative teamwork \nwith structural conservative teamwork. Similar approaches to divide \ndifferent models of teamwork into two opposite groups, such as \n\u2018 work enhancing\u2019 or \u2018work controlling\u2019, have been made by British \nauthors (cf. Babson 1995, Bacon/Storey 1995, Wadding-\nton/Whitston 1996). However, there is no research that examines \nwhether these bipolar models are applicable across countries. \nThe first question is: Can teamwork in different plants be classified \nusing a bi-polar model of teamwork, as conceptualised by these au-\nthors?  \nThe second question regards the consequences of the introduction \nof teamwork, which has brought about substantial changes in the \norganisation of production.  \nThere is wide disagreement about the extent and quality of these \nchanges as well as about their consequences. Influential conceptu-\nalisations describe them as either neo- or post-Fordist, i.e. as either \na renewal or a transcendence of Taylorism (Lane 1995: 146). Wergin: Teamwork in the Automobile Industry 155 \nThe proponents of the post-fordism thesis, such as Piore and Sabel \n(1984) predict that these changes would entail a move away from \nthe taylorist division of labour, and lead to increased skills and \nautonomy for workers. Kern and Schumann (1984) share this opti-\nmism, predicting \u2018the end of the division of labour\u2019\n1. \nIn contrast, members of the French \u00e9cole de r\u00e9gulation (e.g. Coriat \n1980) are very critical of the developments including the introduc-\ntion of teamwork. They interpret them as a renewal rather than a \ntranscendence of Fordism that leads to an intensification of work \nand managerial control, rather than creating better working condi-\ntions and empowering workers. Thus, they talk of neo-fordism \nrather than post-fordism. \nThe more recent industrial relations literature has dealt with these is-\nsues, too. Again, there are two sides. The optimists argue that new \nproductions concepts, of which teamwork is a central element, em-\npower workers and create a better and more stimulating work envi-\nronment. Walton (1985) postulated a shift from a \u2018Management of \nControl\u2019 to a  \u2018Management of Commitment\u2019, which implies \u2018a pro-\ngressive withdrawal of managerial control in favour of employee \nautonomy\u2019 (Gallie et al. 1998: 57). \nThe \u2018simplistic and unitarist biases of these accounts\u2019 \n(Geary/Dubbins 2001: 4) have been criticised widely (cf. ibid.). Ba-\nsically, the criticism is similar to that by the Regulation School. \nHyman and Mason (1995: 191), for example, argue that \u2018empow-\nerment becomes a euphemism for work intensification\u2019.  \nThe second question is: Does teamwork in the automobile industry \novercome the taylorist division of labour and bring about the intro-\nduction of post-fordist modes of production, or is it merely part of a \nneo-fordist rationalisation of production according to the principles \nof Fordism, renewing it rather than transcending it? \nBoth questions are, while dealing with different issues, closely \nlinked. The two polar models of teamwork (to which question one \nrelates, and which will be elaborated upon in the following section) \n                                                 \n1   This is the title of their book. Yet, it should be noted that it is followed by a ques-\ntion mark. While Kern and Schumann are optimistic, they seem to have doubts. 156  European Political Economy Review  \n \n \ncorrespond to \u2018post-fordist teamwork\u2019 and \u2018neo-fordist teamwork\u2019. \n \n3.  Teamwork in the Automobile Industry \u2013  \n  Theory and Literature \n \nAccording to Shaw\u2019s definition (1981: 8),  \n\u2018a group is defined as two or more persons who are interacting with one \nanother in such a manner that each person influences and is influenced by \neach other person.\u2019 \nFurthermore, teams\n2, as opposed to aggregates of people,  \n\u2018(1) endure for a reasonable period (\u2026), (2) have a common goal or goals, \nand (3) have developed at least a rudimentary group structure\u2019 (ibid.). \nIn line with that, Katzenbach/Smith (1993: 45) define a team as: \n\u2018a small number of people with complimentary skills who are committed \nto a common purpose, performance goals, and approach for which they \nhold themselves mutually accountable.\u2019  \nThese definitions refer to small groups of people, as interaction and \nmutual accountability are less likely in large groups. Rosenstiel \n(1978: 40) furthermore stresses the necessity of a \u2018we-feeling\u2019, i.e. \nthe existence of group cohesion, in order to call an aggregate of \npeople a team. The cohesion of a group of people is influenced by \ntheir interdependence, based on the division of labour and their \nemotional relations (ibid.). \nThere are different forms of teamwork. On the one hand, there are \nso-called off-line teams that meet only from time to time, such as \nproposition groups and quality circles. On the other hand, there are \npermanent teams that are part of the regular organisation of work. \nThis article is about the latter form of teamwork. \nThere are different models of teamwork of the latter type. It has \nbeen suggested that two opposing models of teamwork are evolving, \nas stated earlier. Antoni (1994) distinguishes \u2018partly autonomous \nteams\u2019 from \u2018production teams\u2019, Roth (1996b) talks about self-\norganised and taylorised teamwork, while Gerst et al. (1995) con-\ntrast \u2018innovative teamwork\u2019 with \u2018structural conservative teamwork\u2019.  \n                                                 \n2   The terms \u2018group\u2019 and \u2018team\u2019 are used interchangeably here. Wergin: Teamwork in the Automobile Industry 157 \nThese concepts are presented below. While the above-mentioned \nauthors use different terms, their concepts are compatible. I there-\nfore summarise partly autonomous teams, self-organised and inno-\nvative teamwork on the one hand, and production teams, taylorised, \nand structural conservative teamwork on the other.  \n \nFigure 1: Organisation of Tasks and Responsibilities in SATs \n \n                 \n             \n  Personnel \n \nhiring \ntransfers \npromotions \n \nGeneral \nManagement \n \ntarget agreements \nfeedback \nco-ordination \nevaluation \n \nProduction \nManagement \n \nprogram planning \n  Job-Planning \n \nprocess planning \nrationalisation \ntime economics \n \n             \n   \n \norganisation of \nwork \nholiday scheduling \n \nmicro planning \n   \n \nconsultation if \nmembers of team \nare affected \n         \n \ncontinuous im-\nprovement \n \n    semi-autonomous team     \n     small repairs  \nservicing \n \nhandling+transport \nof material \n \nproduction control  \nSPC \n \n  participation in \nchanges \n \n     \n       \n   \n \nmaintenance \ncentral workshop \n \nMaintenance \n      re-planning \npre-planning \nserial planning \n \nEngineering \n \n     \ndisposition  \nstorage \nlogistic planning \n \nLogistics   \naudit  \ninspection planng. \nreceipt of goods \ncontrol \n \nQuality-\nManagement       \n                                  : tasks within the team\u2019s area of responsibility    \n       \n      : tasks outside the team\u2019s area of responsibility   \n                   \n   \nSource: Antoni 1994: 36 \n \n \n3.1  Innovative Teamwork: Semi-Autonomous Teams \n \nThe concept of socio-technical teamwork with semi autonomous \nteams (SAT) became popular through the experiments of the Swed-158  European Political Economy Review  \n \n \nish companies Saab and Volvo, and by projects that were part of the \nGerman HdA programme (cf. introduction) (Berggren 1991). SATs \nare used to overcome traditional structures of work. \n \nThe crucial feature of SATs is that they produce complete compo-\nnents such as engines largely self-organised and self-dependent. \nSATs carry out a considerably extended range of tasks (compared to \nworkers on the assembly line) and assume considerable discretion \nfor the organisation and conduct of their work, independent of supe-\nriors. Besides an extension of direct productive tasks, indirect pro-\nduction and planning tasks are transferred to the team, such as holi-\nday scheduling, maintenance of machines, and the micro-regulation \nof the production process (cf. figure 1) (Gerst et. al. 1995). \nAs a means of self-regulation, team meetings take place on a more \nor less regular basis. In these meetings, work is co-ordinated and \nplanned, and internal problems are discussed. Furthermore, the team \nelects a team speaker who represents the team, but is no superior. \nOne important element of SATs is a decentralisation of the func-\ntions of specialists (Antoni 1994: 35ff). The concept of the SAT \ncomprises accordingly job enrichment (or \u2018vertical integration of \ntasks\u2019), i.e. the integration of indirect production and planning tasks \nand functions (or secondary tasks) into the area of responsibility of \nthe team, as well as job enlargement (or \u2018horizontal extension of \ntasks\u2019), i.e. an extension of direct production tasks (or primary \ntasks) performed by each worker (ibid.: 26ff) (cf. figure three). Job \nenlargement is normally achieved by job rotation\n3. Thus, SATs are \ncharacterised by a quantitative and qualitative extension of tasks.  \n \n3.2  Structural Conservative Teamwork: Taylorised Assembly \nTeams \n \nAssembly teams are fundamentally different from SATs. Here, the \n                                                 \n3   However, job rotation is not necessarily confined to direct production tasks, it \ncan also include indirect production and planning tasks, cf. the case study on \nMercedes A-City.

It is expected, as a \nrule, that each employee be acquainted with at least three stations \nfrom within its section of the line. This makes possible a limited job \n                                                 \n4   The assembly line does not necessarily have to be based on a conveyor belt. \nThe crucial fact here is that manufacturing does not take place stationary. 160  European Political Economy Review  \n \n \nrotation, and thus a high flexibility in the deployment of personnel. \nThe integration of indirect tasks is limited (Antoni 1994: 42f). \nThe self-organisation of these teams, too, remains restricted to few \nareas. The prerequisites for this, such as own scope to act and de-\ncide, team meetings or possibilities to gain additional qualifications \nare normally absent.  \nTeam leaders appointed by the management head teams. They con-\ntrol and evaluate their team and assign work to team members. Con-\nsequently, they take over the role of a superior or foreman, in oppo-\nsition to elected team speakers, who are primus inter pares. \n Planning and execution of work are still largely divided. Separate \ndepartments or superiors are still in charge of all aspects of person-\nnel/HRM, general management, production management, Engineer-\ning, logistics and often maintenance. Only parts of quality manage-\nment, job planning and, sometimes, maintenance are transferred to \nthe teams (Gerst et. al. 1995, Roth 1996b). \n Thus, \n\u2018(t)he reality of work for the employees remains, as before, characterised \nby precise instructions, low requirements and a largely disciplining \nframework. (\u2026) The conditions of work do not differ from traditional mo-\ntor-car plants in most respects; the stress lies mainly on a high workload\u2019 \n(Gerst et. al. 1995: 42f).  \n \n \n4. Case  Studies \n \nThis article is based on four case studies in two British and two \nGerman automobile plants. A comparison of teamwork in Britain \nand Germany is interesting as Britain and Germany are prototypes \nof different production models, the Anglo-Saxon model on the one \nhand, the Rhineland model on the other. While Germany is a highly \nregulated high-wage economy, the British economy is identified \nwith its supposed flexibility and its ability to compete on the basis \nof low labour cost.  Wergin: Teamwork in the Automobile Industry 161 \nThe four studied plants are Nissan Sunderland and Vauxhall Luton \nin Britain and Opel Eisenach and Mercedes-Benz A-City\n5 in Ger-\nmany. Two of the plants, Luton and Eisenach, are owned by the \nsame corporation, General Motors (GM). Therefore, sample allows \ncomparing teamwork within countries as well as within one corpo-\nration across countries\n6. \nIn the following four sections, teamwork in the four mentioned \nplants will be described by looking at the tasks of the teams, the or-\nganisation of work within teams, and the role of team leaders.  \nThe case studies draw on various unpublished materials\n7 and 23 in-\nterviews. \n \n4.1  Opel Eisenach  \nOpel\u2019s Eisenach plant is located in Thuringia in East Germany. It \nopened in 1992 and currently employs about 2,000 people. Eisenach \nis Opel\u2019s first plant that is organised completely according to the \nprinciples of lean production. However, Japanese production meth-\nods were adapted to German circumstances. \nOpel was the first company to emulate Japanese manufacturing \nmethods without a Japanese joint-venture partner. Opel could, how-\never, draw on experiences from other GM plants. Eisenach thus \nrepresents the case of a \u2018transplant\u2019 modelled after the Japanese \nconcepts of \u2018lean production\u2019, but set up by a western company \n(Enderle 1994, Shaiken et al. 1997, J\u00fcrgens 1998: 326ff, Reitz \n1999: 133). \nThe plant is highly productive. Eisenach was identified as most \nproductive car plant in Europe in 1995 (EIU 1995).  In 2002, Eisen-\nach was still fifth most productive plant in Europe (Financial Times, \n07/08/2002). \n                                                 \n5   A large amount of unpublished material on this plant was made accessible to \nthe author with the condition not to reveal the name of the plant. \n6   Because of the small number of cases, the results remain tentative. \n7   These include internal sources from companies and memos from works council-\nlors and researchers. 162  European Political Economy Review  \n \n \nThe Eisenach plant started from the beginning with teams as the ba-\nsic work units (Lieske 1993). As the Eisenach plant is a greenfield \nsite, Opel could implement a working organisation of its choice \nwithout the need to consult a works council.  \nRecruitment for Eisenach was highly selective. Opel hand-picked \nout of a huge reservoir of skilled car workers. As a result, all of the \nline workers are Facharbeiter (skilled workers) (J\u00fcrgens 1998: 332). \n \nThe Teams  \nThe average size of teams is 4.65 members. Within the teams, every \nemployee is expected to master all tasks. Next to direct production \ntasks, teams are responsible for material supply, holiday scheduling, \nselection of new team members, and occasionally for dealing with \nexternal customers and suppliers (Gerst 1995a: 4, Opel 1999a: 7). \nBesides material supply, teams have very few responsibilities for \nindirect production tasks, as there are specialised teams for mainte-\nnance and quality assurance. Teams carry out only minor mainte-\nnance and quality control. Per work cycle (currently around 100 \nsec), team members have about three to six seconds to check the \nquality of their work. \nAn important task of teams in Eisenach is the participation in Kai-\nzen, the continuing improvement process, by making improvement \nsuggestions. Team members are requested to \u2018strive for improve-\nments in cost, quality, productivity etc\u2019 (Opel 1999a: 5). The most \nimportant task in this respect is the reduction of times for the stan-\ndard operation procedures. Management tries to provoke this by \nconstantly reducing cycle times (Gerst 1995a: 6), a method called \n\u2018management by stress\u2019 (Parker/Slaughter 1988). The suggestion \nsystem is quite successful in Eisenach: Workers currently make \nabout 20 suggestions per annum on average. \nIn theory, workers have to stick to the standard operation sheets \n(Opel 1999a: 5), but in practice, this is not supervised, and workers \ndeviate from the standard operation procedures.  Wergin: Teamwork in the Automobile Industry 163 \nTeams are allowed to refuse production targets if they think that \nthese are out of reach, however this does not happen in practice  \n(ibid.). \nJobs are rotated on a regular basis for training and ergonomic rea-\nsons (J\u00fcrgens 1998: 331). Teams determine jointly and independ-\nently how to rotate jobs, which may be weekly, daily or after each \nbreak (Buleweg 1995: 27). According to the works council chair-\nman, job rotation strengthens solidarity and brings about an equal \ndistribution of strain between the members of the team. \nTeam meetings have tailed off in recent years. There are obligatory \nmonthly meetings that last about one hour. They are outside regular \nworking hours and paid as overtime. The meetings are about the or-\nganisation of work as well as quality issues, improvement sugges-\ntions etc. Topics are not given by management (ibid.). \n \nThe Team Leaders \nTeam leaders in Eisenach assume a broad range of responsibilities. \nThey cover for absentees, co-ordinate and allocate work, organise \nteam meetings, train team members, perform most personnel func-\ntions besides holiday scheduling, and assure that the team fulfils the \nperformance standards (Gottschall 1994: 246, Opel 1999a: 6ff).  \nFurthermore, they evaluate and forward improvement suggestions \nmade by members of their team, carry out time measurements, and \nadminister the standard operation sheets and Kanban-cards, i.e. se-\ncure material supply, check the quality of the supplied material, and \nsupervise the production process (Gerst 1995a: 4, Mickler et al. \n1996: 117, J\u00fcrgens 1998: 331). \nThus, the team leader could be described as a \u2018revalued foreman\u2019, \nGerst (1995a: 5) concludes. The works council chairman agrees \nwith this assessment (interview notes). However, team leaders in \nEisenach have no disciplinary functions and no authority to instruct. \nThese functions are performed by so-called \u2018area engineers\u2019. Thus, \nteam leaders are no superiors; they are \u2018organisers\u2019 (ibid.) and \u2018co-\nordinators\u2019 (Buleweg 1995: 27). 164  European Political Economy Review  \n \n \nTeam leaders are appointed by management on suggestions of \nforemen and the works council (K\u00f6hler 1993: 12). They are paid 20 \nper cent more than normal employees.  \nIn a survey in 1996 years ago, 88 per cent of team members indi-\ncated that they were dissatisfied with their team leaders (Opel 1996), \nbut in a more recent survey (Opel 1999b), team members assessed \ntheir leaders \u2018surprisingly positive\u2019 (interview notes). The most \nlikely reason for this is a change in the team leader\u2019s understanding \nof their role, i.e. that team leaders behave less like a superior and \nmore like primus inter pares.  \n \n4.2 Mercedes-Benz\u2019  A-City Plant \nThe Mercedes-Benz plant in A-City, founded at the end of the nine-\nteenth century, produces Engines and engine components. The plant \nhas continuously been extended, is highly mechanised and currently \nemploys 2,700 people. \nBefore teamwork was introduced, production jobs had been limited \nto operating individual machines, i.e. tasks were basically confined \nto machine tending and handling parts. These jobs were highly re-\npetitive, and employees were exposed to considerable physical \nstrain.  \nA company-wide agreement (Mercedes-Benz 1995) between Mer-\ncedes-Benz and the company-wide works council was the basis for \nthe introduction of teamwork. According to this agreement, a joint \nsteering committee was established \u2018to co-ordinate the introduction \nof teamwork and to further develop it\u2019 (ibid.: 246, own translat.). \nFurthermore, workers were involved in the design of their new \nwork areas (Gerst et al. 1995: 376f). The previous workforce was \ntaken over completely. \nThe Teams  \nTeams in A-City consist of 13 members, including the team speaker. \nThe company agreement on teamwork states that \u2018Holistic job de-\nsigns are to be introduced by means of integrating direct, indirect Wergin: Teamwork in the Automobile Industry 165 \nand planning tasks and functions\u2019 (Mercedes-Benz 1995: 242, own \ntranslat.). This has been realised: There are no more dedicated per-\nsonnel for machine setting and manning and quality control \u2013 these \nfunctions are now carried out by the teams \u2013 and there are only few \nmaintenance staff left for major breakdowns. Teams conduct most \nmaintenance tasks too \u2013 not just minor maintenance.  \nIn addition to ten workstations on machines per team that are cycle-\nbound, the comprehensive integration of indirect and related func-\ntions led to the creation of three additional, non-repetitive jobs per \nteam where most indirect tasks \u2013 which were formerly carried out \nby specialists \u2013 are concentrated. These are rotated routinely among \nteam members (Kuhlmann 1996: 126). \nIn addition to indirect production tasks, teams have collectively \ntaken over responsibility for most planning functions. Teams now \nadminister their shift and holiday timetables independently, and or-\nganise the production programme and the sequence of orders to be \nfulfilled independently. \nWithin the team, all tasks and functions are rotated routinely, in-\ncluding the three jobs that are not cycle-bound. Team members ad-\nminister the rotation independently (Gerst et al. 1995: 376ff, Kempe \n2000: 20). \nAccording to the company agreement, \u2018A time of about thirty min-\nutes per week is guaranteed for team meetings\u2019 (Mercedes-Benz \n1995: 245, own translat.). These are led by the team speaker. Man-\nagement does not prescribe the content of the meetings. \n \nThe Team Speakers \nThe team speaker in A-City is fully integrated into the production \nprocess and has hardly any additional responsibilities compared to \n\u2018normal\u2019 team members. Their only additional responsibilities are \npreparation and leadership of team meetings, and the representation \nof the team. Team speakers hold no hierarchical position and posses \nno disciplinary or supervisory functions and have no authority to in-\nstruct. 166  European Political Economy Review  \n \n \nAll indirect and planning tasks were devolved to the team as a \nwhole. Thus, decisions are made by the entire team, not just the \nspeaker. Gerst et al. (1994: 12, own translat.) found that \u2018The team \ninterprets their area of responsibility explicitly as a common task\u2019. \nThe team speaker is elected by his team (Mercedes-Benz 1995: 244) \nand does not receive any additional compensation.  \n \n4.3  Nissan Sunderland  \nNissan\u2019s Sunderland plant in Tyne and Wear opened in 1986. Nis-\nsan started from scratch on a greenfield site, with no traditions of \ntrade unions organisation or established shop-floor custom and \npractice. Nissan thus has been able to experiment with a model of \nits choice from the beginning (Oliver/Wilkinson 1992: 214). All \nworkers have been organised in teams from the very beginning on. \nSunderland is a comparatively large plant: it employs around 5,000 \nand produces three passenger car ranges. In 1999, Nissan\n8 became \nBritain\u2019s biggest carmaker. The plant was the first so-called Japa-\nnese \u2018transplant\u2019 in the UK. It became the benchmark among Euro-\npean manufacturers and was an important catalyst for the diffusion \nof Japanese production methods in Europe (J\u00fcrgens 1998: 323). \nFor the last six years, Sunderland has led the productivity tables for \nEuropean car plants (Financial Times, 07/08/2002, EIU 1997-2002). \n \nThe Teams  \nAll approximately 5,000 employees working on the assembly line \nare organised in teams. Each team consists of eight to 17 workers; \nthe average size is about ten. \nWithin each team, workers are responsible for basic maintenance, \nsub-assembly tasks, and quality assurance for their own work. \nHowever, there are special personnel for maintenance and quality \nassurance. Team members do not assume responsibility for these \n                                                 \n8   Sunderland is Nissan\u2019s only plant in the UK. Wergin: Teamwork in the Automobile Industry 167 \ntasks completely. There is one so-called check-and-repair-person \nfor each two teams who checks the quality of tasks performed by \nthese two teams and repairs faults. Similarly, there is still dedicated \nstaff for maintenance. Yet, in opposition to the traditional taylorist \nplant, team members are expected to assist maintenance personnel \nwhen they come along. \nWorkers\u2019 autonomy in Sunderland is very restricted. According to \nthe AEEU regional officer responsible for Sunderland, work at \nSunderland is \u2018dictated\u2019 (interview notes). Corresponding with that, \na member of NMUK\u2019s company council stated that team members \ncan make \u2018no decisions at all\u2019 (ibid.). \nEven the possibility to make changes to their work routines inde-\npendently does not exist, as supervisors do not allow even the \nslightest deviation from the \u2018standard operation routines\u2019\n9, and \nchanges in the standard operation procedures must first be cleared \nby several superiors before they can be implemented. Several work-\ners reported that in many instances, even though they could provide \nbetter solutions, these were frequently ignored or deferred. \nWorkers are expected to master different tasks from their team\u2019s \nsection, but not all. The team\u2019s supervisor assures that each team \nmember is able to cover three jobs, and that each job is to be cov-\nered by three people. Nissan thinks that \u2018this formula will allow \nenough flexibility so that all jobs can be covered at all times\u2019 (Gar-\nrahan/Stewart 1992: 84). Therefore, a complete rotation (of all men \nthrough all jobs) is not possible. In fact, jobs are not changed much \nat all. One employee said: \u2018On-line I would say I move around \npretty rarely. On-line you are given a specific job and it is very rare \nyou will change from this job unless somebody is absent\u2019 (quoted in \nibid.: 83). \nThere are daily team meetings at the beginning of each shift that last \nabout five minutes. Discussions do not usually take place in these \nmeetings; they are to give information to team members merely. \nWhat Nissan calls \u2018consultative decision making\u2019 (Wickens 1985: \n                                                 \n9   Standard operation routines, recorded on so-called \u2018standard operation sheets\u2019, \nare a central element of Taylorism.  168  European Political Economy Review  \n \n \n19ff) (in the meetings) is in fact a process of managers and team \nleaders \u2018informing and imposing the pre-ordained \u201cright\u201d answer\u2019 \n(Garrahan/Stewart 1992: 96ff). \n \nThe Team Leaders  \nThe team leader has not many tasks; he is merely responsible for \ntraining and development in his team, for leading the daily team \nmeetings, and for few planning functions. He works on-line regu-\nlarly with his team members. He has no disciplinary functions and \nno authority to instruct. \nThe supervisor, on the other hand, is responsible for basically eve-\nrything that happens in his zone (Wickens 1985: 21), he is \u2018like a \nmanaging director\u2019 (interview notes) for his zone, which comprises \ntwo teams, and \u2018holds together everything\u2019 (ibid.). He is responsible \nfor finance, personnel, efficiency, quality and Kaizen, and has dis-\nciplinary functions, among other functions.  \n \n4.4  Vauxhall Luton  \nThe Vauxhall Luton plant in Bedfordshire near London was built in \n1902. Substantial investments were made to upgrade it in the 1990s. \nThe plant closed down\n10 in 2001, by which time it employed about \n2,000 people. \nThe investments in the 1990s led to plant-wide changes focusing on \nthe implementation of lean production techniques, including team-\nwork. Negotiations on the introduction of teamwork began in 1990. \nInitially, unions were suspicious of teamworking\n11 . However, \nteamwork had already been introduced in Vauxhall\u2019s Ellesmere Port \nplant, and there was consensus that it wouldn\u2019t be possible to reject \nteamwork altogether. Therefore, unions \u2013 in particular the TGWU \u2013 \n                                                 \n10  This happened shortly after interviews were carried out. Still, I am using the \npresent tense in this case study. \n11  Unions feared that teamwork would lead to job losses and poorer and harder \nworking conditions and that unions\u2019 influence would be reduced. Wergin: Teamwork in the Automobile Industry 169 \nchose to \u2018engage and change\u2019 rather than to oppose teamwork alto-\ngether.  \nAs the strategy of Vauxhall\u2019s management was to get union consent \nin all stages in order to avoid damaging confrontations, unions got \nsome concessions from management. In the final agreement, both \nsides achieved their objectives (Stewart 1997: 5). It states, among \nother things, that the role of union representatives would be pre-\nserved and that team leaders have no role in discipline and griev-\nance cases (Carr 1994: 201ff, Murakami 1998: 802). \nA ballot of union members in August 1992 accepted the agreement. \nThe previous workforce was taken over completely. \n \nThe Teams \nTeams in Luton may consist of five to 15 people according to the \nplant agreement. However, as there have been problems to manage \nlarge teams, the maximum size of teams was, in fact, seven, while \nthe average size at the time of the interviews was 6.3.  \nTeams members take over responsibilities for minor maintenance \nand self-inspection \u2018subject to time allowance\u2019 (Vauxhall 1992: 19) \nand are requested to ensure that the required quality standards are \nmet and to rectify defective parts, wherever possible. However, \nthere is still dedicated staff for maintenance and quality assurance \nas well as material handling (Vauxhall 1992: 19ff, Vauxhall 1996).  \nFurthermore, team members are expected to participate in Kaizen \nby doing their own time and motion studies, by helping to control \nscrap, and by looking for improvements in the design of the product \nand the safety of the work area (ibid.). That is \u2018as far as it goes\u2019 (in-\nterview notes); other tasks are not devolved to team members. \nAt the time of the interviews, workers in Luton made just two im-\nprovement suggestions on average per year. If workers have ideas \nto improve the work process or the product, they usually talk about \nthis with their fellow team members initially. If the intended \nchanges are rather small, they might be tested straight away on-line. 170  European Political Economy Review  \n \n \nThen, a formal improvement suggestion is filled out, usually by the \nwhole team collectively. Depending on the level of the change, the \nteam leader, supervisor, shift manager or unit manager, who may \nconsult engineers when necessary, decides whether to adopt the \nsuggestion or not.  \nAs in other plants, Standard Operation Sheets exist in Luton, but \ntheir compliance is not supervised, and in practice, workers deviate \nfrom them. \nJobs are rotated within the team, and where necessary, also between \nteams within job classifications (Murakami 1998: 801). Job rotation \ntakes place on a regular, scheduled base. Teams decide independ-\nently on how to rotate jobs. While it is officially the team leader\u2019s \nresponsibility to organise and plan job rotation, the team usually \nagrees jointly on how to rotate. Jobs may be rotated weekly, daily or \ntwice daily, for example. As team members are expected to master \nall jobs from their team\u2019s section, a \u2018complete rotation\u2019\n12 is possible. \nTeam-meetings take place as the need arises. They are rather short \nand informal. Often, meetings are hold in breaks, which last 25 \nminutes\n13.  Form and contents of team meetings are subject to joint \nregulation according to the plant agreement (Vauxhall 1992). \nMeetings may be about work scheduling or improvement sugges-\ntions, for example. However, Kaizen is not usually an important \ntopic, as there is a separate, daily Kaizen meeting, which is attended \nmainly by specialists. From time to time, team members of \u2018affected \nteams\u2019 may attend these meetings, but this does not happen often, \nprobably once a year.  \nThis \u2013 that Kaizen is not usually an important topic \u2013 may explain \nthe fact that team members make less than two improvement sug-\ngestion on average per annum, despite the team\u2019s responsibility for \nKaizen. \n \n \n                                                 \n12   i.e. everyone performs all of the team\u2019s jobs subsequently, not just some \n13   Which is not to say that the \u2018team meeting\u2019 lasts the entire break. Wergin: Teamwork in the Automobile Industry 171 \nThe Team Leaders \nManagement appoints team leaders. Eighty per cent of team leaders \nare former foremen who were \u2018transformed\u2019 to team leaders in 1992, \nwhen teamwork was introduced (Murakami 1995a: 97, Murakami \n1998: 800ff).  \nMurakami (ibid.) predicted that team leaders\u2019 responsibilities would \nbe expanded into those of a traditional supervisor, resulting in team \nleaders and supervisors sharing management responsibilities. How-\never, unions ensured that this has not happened. The deputy conve-\nnor for the TGWU at the Luton plant reported that there were some \nteam leaders who actually tried to take over the role of a foreman or \nsupervisor, but \u2018we (the unions, N.W.) made sure that didn\u2019t hap-\npen\u2019 (interview notes). \nTeam leaders must be able to perform all operations within the \nteam\u2019s area, as they cover for absentees. They plan and organise job \nrotation, ensure material supply, monitor if team members meet \ntheir responsibilities\n14, take a leading role in cost-reduction activi-\nties within the team, and train team members. They also regulate in-\nternal matters and disputes. \nDespite the range of functions they perform, team leaders are re-\nsponsible only for minor decisions, such as how to rotate jobs and \nwhich tools to use. Supervisors or managers make all bigger deci-\nsions. Team leaders have no disciplinary functions, either. These are \nperformed by supervisors, who are responsible for around four \nteams and perform all personnel issues (Vauxhall 1994).  \nSince team leaders are appointed, \u2018many workers seem to view \nthem as a new form of supervision rather than integral part of their \nteams\u2019 (Murakami 1998: 804f). \n \n5.   Comparison \nIn this section, teamwork in the four studied plants is compared.  \n                                                 \n14   Here, team leaders do take over supervisory functions, even though they do \nnot officially have those functions. 172  European Political Economy Review  \n \n \nThe first part deals with production technology, while the following \nparts deal with organisational aspects \u2013 horizontal and vertical inte-\ngration of tasks, the role of the team-leaders, and the degree of self-\nregulation. \n \n5.1 Production  Technology \nTeams in all four plants work on a rather short-cycled assembly line \nwith cycle times below two minutes. In this respect, all plants are \nidentical. However, there is one important difference concerning \nproduction technology: Eisenach, Luton and Sunderland are final \nassembly plants. In the units where the large majority of employees \nworks, trim and final assembly, work is almost purely manual\n15. \nThe Mercedes plant, on the other hand, is an engine plant that is \nhighly mechanised\n16. The conditions for job enrichment are more \nfavourable in areas of mechanised production than in areas of man-\nual work, as there are more indirect tasks to be performed in \nmechanised areas, such as maintenance\n17   and machine set-up \n(Kuhlmann 1996, Schumann/Gerst 1996). \nAnother important technological difference between A-City and the \nthree other plants is the low level of buffers in Sunderland, Luton \nand Eisenach. In A-City, there are comparatively many buffers, \nwhich allow for a de-coupling of the production flow.  \nAs the production technology, or \u2018technological framework\u2019 at Eis-\nenach, Luton and Sunderland is basically the same\n18, there are no \ntechnological reasons for different forms of working organisation in \ngeneral and different models of teamwork in particular in these \nplants. \n                                                 \n15   The preceding units (press, body, paint) are highly automated, and thus only \nfew people work in these areas. \n16   The plant is mechanised, but not automated, i.e. there are many machines in \nA-City, but no robots. \n17   There are maintenance tasks to be performed in areas of manual work, too, \nbut as there are far fewer machines in areas of manual work than in automated \nones, there are far less maintenance tasks to be performed. \n18   There are many minor differences in the production technology between these \nthree plants, but these differences don\u2019t have a significant impact on the work-\ning organisation. Wergin: Teamwork in the Automobile Industry 173 \nAs the assembly line with short cycle times remains central to all \nfour plants, technological dependence (i.e. workers\u2019 dependence on \nthe assembly line) is rather pronounced  (which is even increased by \nthe low level of buffers in Sunderland, Luton and Eisenach), which \nrestricts the scope for (teams\u2019) self regulation, regardless of whether \nindependent decisions by teams are permitted. Thus, this techno-\nlogical framework does not provide good conditions for the imple-\nmentation of innovative, self-organised teamwork such as in the \nVolvo factories Kalmar and Uddevalla\n19, and thus the empowerment \nof employees. \nAfter dealing with production technology, I will now turn to organ-\nisational aspects. \n \n5.2 Job  Enlargement \nIn A-City, Eisenach and Luton, workers master all jobs from their \nteam\u2019s section, and teams rotate regularly and completely (i.e. \nthrough all jobs). In Sunderland, on the other hand, each worker is \nrequested to master only three jobs (and in practice, they do not \nnormally master more than that), so that complete rotation cannot \ntake place. Furthermore, while job rotation in the other plant takes \nplace on a scheduled basis, this is not the case in Sunderland. Most \nteam members stay at their workstation most of the time and change \nonly it in order to cover for absentees. Therefore, a balancing of dif-\nferent motion routines does not take place. If jobs are rotated in \nSunderland, this is prescribed by supervisors, while teams decide \nthemselves on how to rotate in the other plants. \n \n5.3 Job  Enrichment \nThe integration of indirect production and planning tasks and func-\ntions in the team\u2019s area of responsibility (also called \u2018vertical inte-\ngration\u2019 of jobs or \u2018job enrichment\u2019) is most pronounced in A-City. \nThis comprehensive integration improves co-operation within the \n                                                 \n19  In the Kalmar and Uddevalla plants, there were no assembly lines (thus as-\nsembly took place stationary), and cycle times were around two hours \n(Berggren 1991, 1992, 1997). 174  European Political Economy Review  \n \n \nteam, brings about a reduction of hierarchy and a re-qualification of \nproduction work (Gerst et al. 1995), breaking with the taylorist \nprinciples that production workers should be only minimally quali-\nfied and that planning and execution of tasks are to be carried out \nby different people.  \nThe case of Mercedes-Benz shows that \u2018a consistent implementa-\ntion of self-organisation has positive effects even under otherwise \nunchanged work structures\u2019 (Gerst et al. 1999: 390). \nJob enrichment in the other plants is considerably less comprehen-\nsive. Both teams in Luton and Sunderland have only few additional \ntasks besides their direct production tasks. As there are still dedi-\ncated personnel for maintenance and quality assurance in both \nplants, team members are only responsible for minor maintenance \nand a short self-inspection of performed jobs. Furthermore, team \nmembers are expected to participate in Kaizen, the continuous im-\nprovement process. Other indirect production tasks or planning \nfunctions are not devolved to the teams. Thus, job enrichment for \nteam members in Luton and Sunderland turns out to be very limited. \nEisenach lies between those two poles (A-City on the one hand, Lu-\nton and Sunderland on the other), as team members are also respon-\nsible for material supply, holiday scheduling and the selection of \nnew members next to their responsibilities for quality assurance and \nKaizen. \nBecause of their responsibility for Kaizen and Quality, employees \nin Eisenach are \u2018qualificatory challenged\u2019 (Mickler et al. 1996: 118) \nand become integrated into decision processes, for which superiors \nand specialists were responsible exclusively before. This results in a \nreduction of hierarchy, according to Adler (1992) and a higher \ncommitment of production workers. However, the permanently high \nlevel of performance is impeding for the maintenance of this com-\nmitment, Mickler et al. (1996: 118) object. \nAs in Eisenach, Kaizen and Quality are among the tasks of teams in \nLuton, however Kaizen seems to be less important than in Eisenach, \nas workers in Eisenach make about ten times more improvement \nsuggestions than workers in Luton, and as Kaizen is no important Wergin: Teamwork in the Automobile Industry 175 \ntopic in team meetings in Luton (20 compared to 2 suggestions per \nyear, cf. above), which may be explained by the fact that there is a \nseparate, daily Kaizen meeting in Luton. It is likely that team mem-\nbers thus feel that there are specialists who do this job. Furthermore, \none of employees\u2019 main criticisms in Luton is that management \ndoes not listen to them and their ideas. \nThe situation in Sunderland is similar: team members are responsi-\nble for Kaizen, but it has no high priority for them. Team meetings \nprovide no possibility to discuss improvement suggestions, as there \nare no discussions in team meetings (cf. sec. 4.3). Furthermore, \nsimilar to the situation in Luton, workers get the feeling that their \ncontributions are not appreciated (Garrahan/Stewart 1992: 102). \nIn Eisenach, on the other hand, separate Kaizen meetings as in Lu-\nton do not exist, and thus it is a more important topic in the team \nmeetings. Furthermore, there are \u2018Kaizen garages\u2019 close to the line \nwhere workers can test improvement suggestions independently\n20. \nThe existence of these \u2018Kaizen garages\u2019 shows workers that man-\nagement does appreciate workers\u2019 ideas.  \nIn Luton, such garages do not exist, thus workers cannot test their \nideas if it is not possible to test them directly on-line, which is obvi-\nously not always possible\n21. Thus, the \u2018qualificatory challenge\u2019 for \nworkers, which Mickler et al. (1996) found in Eisenach, is not pre-\nsent in Luton. In Sunderland, testing of ideas is not possible, as \neven slight deviations from the standard operations procedures are \nforbidden.  \n \n5.4  Role of Team Leaders \nWhile at both GM plants management controls teams through ap-\npointed team leaders, team speakers at Mercedes\u2019 A-City plant are \nelected by workers, and can also be elected out of office. This \n                                                 \n20   Workers have got up to 52 minutes daily at their disposal to test improvement \nsuggestions (or, for example, to discuss them with fellow members of the \nteam) in the overlapping period of two shifts. \n21   Testing on-line is confined to small changes in the standard operations proce-\ndures. Larger changes could potentially interrupt the production flow. 176  European Political Economy Review  \n \n \nmakes it rather likely that they will stand up for their team members \nand defend them against superiors. The team speaker in A-City is a \nmoderator, spokesman and person to turn to for management (Gerst \net al. 1999: 374), but definitely not a superior, while team leaders in \nLuton and Eisenach are quasi-superiors. \nFurthermore, as team speakers at Mercedes are not appointed by \nmanagement, they are less exposed to management control than \nteam leaders in the other plants and pay much attention to the views \nof their team members (Gerst et al. 1995), in opposition to team \nleaders at other plants\n22. \nWhile team leaders at the GM plants perform many tasks, most im-\nportantly the co-ordination and allocation of work and the monitor-\ning of team members, team leaders and speakers at A-City and Sun-\nderland have only few additional tasks (compared with normal team \nmembers), which is stressed by the fact that they work regularly on-\nline, while team leaders at Eisenach and Luton only work on-line to \ncover for absentees. Team leaders in Sunderland have a weak role, \nas the supervisor is responsible for almost everything. The team \nspeaker in A-City has got a stronger role, despite his few tasks, as \nhe is elected which gives him a high degree of legitimacy among his \nfellow team members. \nWhile teamwork in A-City is team (member) centred, in Luton and \nEisenach it is leader centred, i.e. the area of (team-) leadership re-\nsponsibility is considerably larger that that of team (member) re-\nsponsibilities. Teams in Sunderland are neither, as neither team \nmembers, nor leaders have any scope to make independent deci-\nsions. All decisions (besides those concerning training) are made by \nthe supervisor, i.e. by someone who does not belong to the team. \n \n5.5  Degree of Self-regulation \nFrom the previous discussion, it follows that teams at Mercedes are \nfar more autonomous and self regulated than teams in the other \n                                                 \n22  For Vauxhall, cf. Murakami (1995b); for Opel, cf. Opel (1996) and (1999b); \nfor Vauxhall, cf. Garrahan/Stewart (1992). Wergin: Teamwork in the Automobile Industry 177 \nplants. In the GM and Nissan plants, superiors retained far more re-\nsponsibilities than in A-City.  \nAt Mercedes, workers have comprehensive freedom for the design \nand organisation of their work process. Mercedes\u2019 management is \nconvinced that this is the best way to free workers\u2019 creativity and \nachieve their commitment, which is submerged in traditional, ford-\nist assembly line production. These changes are also welcomed by a \ngreat majority of employees. \nIn Eisenach, teams with their strong team leaders have a consider-\nable scope for self-regulation concerning work scheduling and the \ndeployment of personnel, however they always have to consider \nstrict production targets and the (intended) scarcity of personnel, \nwhich both restrict them.  \nIn Luton, teams have less scope for self-regulation than teams in \nEisenach, as teams and their leaders are not responsible for person-\nnel functions as in Eisenach, and they cannot refuse production tar-\ngets, as teams in Eisenach theoretically can. The same limitations \napply. Thus, besides job rotation, \u2018decision making is not in the \nhand of the group\u2019 (interview notes) in Luton. \nWorkers in Sunderland contribute to flexibility and productivity, \nbut teams are not self-organised whatsoever. Internal relations are \nstill very hierarchical, as the supervisor is basically responsible for \neverything (Wickens 1985, Wickens 1987), with the result that \nteams (including their leaders) have hardly any responsibilities be-\nsides their direct production tasks. Teamwork and the organisation \nof work at Sunderland in general have nothing to do with empower-\ning workers on the shop-floor (cf. Garrahan/Stewart 1992).  \n6. Discussion \nTeamwork in the four studied plants differs widely. Teamwork at \nA-City comes close to the ideal of innovative teamwork, while \nteamwork at Sunderland pretty much represents the structural con-\nservative prototype. Teamwork in none of the four plants could jus-\ntifiably be called post-fordist, but teamwork at Mercedes comes \nmuch closer to it than teamwork at Nissan.  178  European Political Economy Review  \n \n \nAs the models of teamwork in the four plants differ considerably, so \ndo the potential consequences (of the introduction of teamwork) on \nemployees. Teamwork can lead to an empowerment of employees, \nor to an intensification of work and management control. It has the \npotential for both, and thus claims that teamwork invariably leads to \none of the two cannot be taken seriously. \nWhich form of teamwork is introduced in a plant depends on a \nnumber of factors, local as well as national ones. Important factors \nare the \u2018management style\u2019, union attitudes to teamwork, and the re-\nlationship between management and unions.  \nGiven the strength of unions in the motor industry, the options cho-\nsen by unions can be a significant factor in influencing management \nstrategy. Therefore, the model for change, and with it, the model of \nteamwork, in an unionised plant needs to incorporate particular un-\nion responses to company policies (Carr 1994: 207).  \nThis is why the implementation of teamwork at Sunderland and Lu-\nton proceeded in rather different ways, and this, in turn, is one cen-\ntral reason why the realised models are rather different. Nissan was \nable to start from scratch, establishing a new factory on a greenfield \nsite, with no traditions of trade unions organisation or established \nshop-floor custom and practice in an environment of high unem-\nployment and no tradition of trade union militancy. This, together \nwith the stress on careful selection of a loyal workforce allowed \nNissan to impose a model of its choice unilaterally. The conclusion \nof a de-facto strike-free \u2018sweetheart deal\u2019 with a co-operative un-\nion\n23, which was possible for the same circumstances, together with \nthe careful selection of workers, furthermore reduced the danger of \nshop-floor resistance in the future (cf. Holloway 1987, \nOliver/Wilkinson 1992). \n                                                 \n23   According to Holloway (1987: 147ff), this deal was only possible after the de-\nstruction of \u2018old traditions\u2019 and a considerable weakening of unions in the mo-\ntor industry, which Holloway ascribes to changes in the management style at \nBritish Leyland/Rover at the time when Ryder and Edwardes were CEOs. \nHolloway (ibid.) postulates that the crushing of unions under Edwardes had an \nimpact on the whole motor-car industry, which Nissan was able to exploit. Wergin: Teamwork in the Automobile Industry 179 \nVauxhall management, on the other hand, had to cope with strong, \nestablished unions which (in particular the TGWU) were critical \nabout new, \u2018lean\u2019 working practices. Thus, in order to prevent dam-\naging confrontations with employees and unions, Vauxhall chose to \nmake some concessions to unions regarding their future role in the \nplant. As a result, unions could secure many of their old positions. \nThe shop steward continues to be the key actor in the workplace, \nalbeit in an altered state (cf. Carr 1994, Stewart 1997, Murakami \n1998). \nThe differences between A-City and Eisenach concerning the im-\nplementation of teamwork are similar to those between Sunderland \nand Luton: The Mercedes plant is a brownfield plant with a strong \nworks council. Whether or not to consult the works council was no \nquestion, as the works constitution act gives works council the right \nto co-determination in such questions.  \nEisenach, on the other hand, is a newly set-up plant on a greenfield \nsite, thus there was no works council which had to be consulted, and \nthus the model of teamwork was imposed unilaterally by manage-\nment. Therefore, the model of teamwork realised in Eisenach is \nvery much about rationalisation. \nTo conclude: In A-city and in Luton, teamwork was introduced into \nplants where traditions of industrial relations already existed. There-\nfore, management had to seek agreements with union representa-\ntives (in the case of Luton) and the works council (in the case of A-\nCity)\n24, respectively. This is for different reasons: In Germany, \nthere is a legal requirement to do this, and in Britain, management \nhad to recognise existing union power\n25. \nAnother important factor for differences between different models \nof teamwork is that self-organised, innovative teamwork, in which \nteam members assume responsibility for most indirect production \nand planning tasks, rests on one characteristic which is a constitu-\n                                                 \n24   However, works council members are de facto union representatives, too, as \nIG Metall always wins large majorities in the works council elections in car \nfactories. Thus, most works councillors are also IG Metall members. \n25   Which is not to say that unions in German automobile plants are not powerful, \nquite the opposite. 180  European Political Economy Review  \n \n \ntive element of the German production system: skilled labour. \nHowever, the fact that the German production system possesses the \npreconditions for innovative teamwork does not necessarily mean \nthat this concept of teamwork has always been realised in German \nplants. Skilled labour is a necessary condition, but not a sufficient \none, as the case of Opel Eisenach demonstrates.  \nFurthermore, it has been mentioned that the conditions for the in-\ntroduction of more innovative concepts of teamwork are more fa-\nvourable in areas of automated production, as in the Mercedes plant, \nthan in areas of manual work. \n \n6.1  Bi-polarity of Different Models of Teamwork? \nAfter the description and comparison of the four cases, I shall now \ncome back to my two research questions. The first question was \nwhether teamwork in different car factories can be depicted using a \nbi-polar model of teamwork, as conceptualised by various authors. \nThe comparison in the previous section shows that teamwork in \nMercedes\u2019 A-City plant is almost the opposite of teamwork prac-\ntised in Nissan\u2019s Sunderland plant. The model of teamwork that has \nbeen realised in A-City centres around the creation of skilled, com-\nprehensive job designs and an extension of self-organisation on the \nshop floor. These concepts come very close to the ideal type of in-\nnovative teamwork as defined above, despite the continuing exis-\ntence of the assembly line. The important fact is that employees in \nA-City are, indeed, empowered. \nTeamwork practised in Sunderland, on the other hand, can clearly \nbe assigned to the structural conservative model of teamwork. Here, \nthe possibilities for workers to influence production do not increase, \nteams are not self-organised, and job enrichment and enlargement \nare very limited.   \nThus, these two models of teamwork fit the categories of the bi-\npolar model of teamwork as described above. However, a compari-\nson between Sunderland on the one hand, and Luton and Eisenach \non the other shows that teamwork basing on the principles of lean Wergin: Teamwork in the Automobile Industry 181 \nproduction is not necessarily identical. While the organisation of \nwork in all three plants follows the same example, the outcomes are \ndifferent. Teamwork in Sunderland, Luton and Eisenach represents \ndifferent approaches to \u2018Japan-oriented\u2019 teamwork, which, while \nhaving many similarities (cf. above), differ significantly with re-\nspect to the position of the team and their leader in the internal hier-\narchy, as well as regarding employees\u2019 integration into optimising \nactivities (Kaizen).  \nThe first point \u2013 the position of teams and their leaders in the inter-\nnal hierarchy \u2013 sets Eisenach with it s strong teams and leaders \napart from Sunderland, where teams and their leaders have got a \nvery weak position, with Luton lying somewhere in between. The \nsecond point \u2013 employees\u2019 role in Kaizen \u2013 sets Eisenach apart \nfrom Luton and Sunderland, as Kaizen is de facto less important in \nthe latter two plants. Thus, the cases of Luton and, particularly, Eis-\nenach demonstrate that increased participation and self-organisation \non the shop floor are not incompatible with \u2018lean production\u2019. \nThis means that teamwork based on the concepts of lean production \ncannot be equated with structural conservative teamwork a priori, as \nthe case of Sunderland may suggest. Teamwork in Eisenach rather \nrepresents an intermediate position between the two ideal types \u2018in-\nnovative\u2019 and \u2018structural conservative\u2019 teamwork. Adler (1995) \nsuggests the term \u2018democratic Taylorism\u2019 for this third model\n26. \nThe teamwork model that has been implemented in Luton, in turn, \nlies between \u2018structural conservative teamwork\u2019 and \u2018democratic \nTaylorism\u2019\n27.  \nThe bi-polar model of teamwork was useful some years ago, when \nalmost all forms of teamwork realised in the automotive industry \n                                                 \n26  With this term, Adler (1995) relates to NUMMI, not to Eisenach. However, \nEisenach is strikingly similar to NUMMI, as NUMMI acted as role model for \nEisenach. For reasons of space, this model named \u2018democratic Taylorism\u2019 will \nnot be described here, but as stated, it is strikingly similar to the model real-\nised in Eisenach. For details, cf. Adler (1992) and (1995). \n27  I will not elaborate where exactly between these two poles Luton and Eisen-\nach are located, as this is not necessary for my purpose, that is to show that a \nbi-polar categorisation of teamwork does not depict the reality of teamwork in \nthe automobile industry. 182  European Political Economy Review  \n \n \ndid indeed correspond to either of the two prototypes (innovative or \nstructural conservative), as teamwork was oriented either on \u2018Vol-\nvoism\u2019 (i.e. socio-technical, \u2018innovative\u2019 teamwork) or \u2018Toyotism\u2019 \n(i.e. \u2018structural conservative\u2019 teamwork in Japanese plants). There \nwas no middle ground. \nToday, this bi-polar model of teamwork does not depict reality ade-\nquately any more. Newer models of teamwork such as in Luton and \nEisenach are, while being based on the principles of lean production \nin a general sense, not modelled on any specific Japanese plant\n28, \nbut rather on the US-American transplants such as NUMMI, CAMI \nand Saturn, which are joint-ventures between US-American and \nJapanese companies. While the former (the Japanese-owned plants) \ndo fit the prototype of structural conservative teamwork, the latter \n(the American-based transplants) don\u2019t. The latter rather represent \nan intermediate type. \nThus, this research suggests that the emergence the so-called trans-\nplants, and of forms of teamwork modelled on it (such as in Eisen-\nach and Luton) blurs the previously clear-cut bi-polar model of \nteamwork in the automotive industry. \n \n6.2 Neo-  or  Post-Fordism? \nThe second question was whether current models of teamwork sig-\nnify a development towards post-fordism, or whether they are \nmerely part of a neo-fordist approach to rationalisation. \nThe case studies presented here suggest that it is premature to speak \nof the end of Fordism. Teamwork based on the principled of lean \nproduction is different from traditional taylorist forms of production, \nbut it is definitely not post-fordist. While some rigidities of Taylor-\nism are defused, the assembly line is still present in all four facto-\nries, cycle times are still short\n29, and line-dependence is even in-\ncreased by the reduction of buffers in three of the plants. This \nmodel of teamwork is essentially a means of rationalisation that \n                                                 \n28   meaning a factory owned by a Japanese company, and not necessarily based \nin Japan \n29   i.e. the division of labour is still high Wergin: Teamwork in the Automobile Industry 183 \nobeys the laws of Taylorism, and does not question the assembly \nline. Thus, this form of teamwork is neo-fordist rather than post-\nfordist. \nI shall now go into each of the four cases briefly. In order to illus-\ntrate why the four cases cannot be called post-fordist, I apply a \nmodel developed by Berggren (1992). This model integrates differ-\nent indicators for Fordism into two dimensions, working organisa-\ntion, (measured in \u2018independence\u2019 of the team) and production \ntechnology. \nAs stated earlier, the assembly line with short cycle times remains \ncentral to all four plants. There are not even attempts to modify the \nassembly line via a de-coupling of workstations or similar measures. \nThus, in this dimension, all four plants remain on the same level, on \nthe initial position (traditional assembly line). While on could object \nthat the presence of Andon-Systems in all plants beside A-City is an \nimportant modification of the assembly line, as it gives every \nworker the possibility to stop the line, the reduction of buffers in the \nsame plants works in the other direction. \nThus, it remains to compare the organisation of work in the four \nplants. As I have done this in the previous section already, this shall \nbe done briefly here.  \nThe organisation of work in Nissan\u2019s Sunderland plant has not tran-\nscended Fordism. At best, it has supplemented classical Taylorist \nmechanisms of control with newer and subtler means of social con-\ntrol (Garrahan/Stewart 1992), above all peer control. From the \nworkers\u2019 point of view, there are no considerable differences be-\ntween a plant with a traditional working organisation and the Nissan \nplant, apart from the fact that they work even harder (interview \nnotes). \nThe degree of workers\u2019 self-regulation goes furthest at Mercedes A-\nCity. The case of Mercedes demonstrates that, even under unfa-\nvourable, restrictive technological conditions such as line produc-\ntion, it is possible to transform Taylorist forms of work into self-\norganised teamwork that allows greater employees\u2019 participation \n(Schumann/Gerst 1996: 41). 184  European Political Economy Review  \n \n \nLuton and Eisenach lie between these two poles on the \u2018working \norganisation axis\u2019, whereby the degree of self-regulation is some-\nwhat larger in Eisenach. \n \nFigure 3: a two-dimensional classification of the examined cases  \n \n                 Independence       \n \n integrated, \nqualified  \nteamwork \n 4  \u2022  A-City \n    \n \nstrong team \norganisation  3 \n    \n \nweak team \norganisation  2 \n\u2022 \n \n\u2022 \n \n\u2022 \n \n \n \nEisenach \n \nLuton \n \nSunderland \n \n    \n \ntraditional \norganisation \nof work \n 1 \n    \n        \n        \n      1   2  3    4 \nP\nr\no\nd\nu\nc\nt\ni\no\nn\n \nd\ne\ns\ni\ng\nn\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     assembly \nline \nmodified \nassembly \nline \nparallel  flow \nsystems, var. \ncycle times \ncomplete \nassembly \n \n          \n \nSource: Berggren 1992: 105 (classification of cases by the author) \n \n \nClassifying the four cases in the pattern developed by Berggren il-\nlustrates why none of the studied cases can be called post-fordist: \nWhile the introduction of teamwork in the four plants dissociates \nwork from Fordism in one dimension to varying degrees (not a t all \nin the case of Sunderland though), it doesn\u2019t in the second dimen-\nsion of production technology (cf. figure 3) \u2013 teams still work on \npost-fordist forms \n \n of production \nrather traditional, \n   \ntaylorist forms of  \n \nproduction Wergin: Teamwork in the Automobile Industry 185 \nrather traditional assembly lines, not in stationary \u2018assembly is-\nlands\u2019\n30. \nThese forms of teamwork move production away from the tradi-\ntional taylorist working organisation, but they do not transcend Tay-\nlorism altogether. While working organisation hardly changes at all \nat Nissan, the changes at the GM plants are considerable, but they \nremain within the framework of Fordism rather than transcending it, \nthus they are neo-fordist rather than post-fordist. The changes in the \nworking organisation are most pronounced at Mercedes, where \nelements of post-fordist forms of production can be discovered, \nsuch as the softening the clear taylorist distinction between instruc-\ntion and execution.  \nYet, as mentioned before, these changes take place only in one di-\nmension, namely working organisation (y-axis in fig. 3), while there \nare no considerable changes in the area of production technology \n(x-axis). Thus, none of the four models of teamwork transcends \nfordism altogether. They are neo-fordist rather than post-fordist. \n \n7. Conclusion \nThe general question behind this article (and behind the two more \nspecific research questions) is: Which impact does teamwork have \non employees? This article has shown that there are different forms \nof teamwork, ranging from \u2018structural conservative\u2019 teamwork to \n\u2018innovative teamwork\u2019\n31. While the bi-polar conceptual framework \nof teamwork does not depict reality adequately (any more), it is true \nthat models of teamwork realised in different plants do differ con-\nsiderably indeed. Thus, the impact of teamwork on employees can-\nnot be judged a priori. An examination of the individual case is nec-\nessary. Only this can tell whether teamwork brings about an en-\nhancement of working conditions, and possibly an empowerment, \nor whether it means an intensification of work and control. Team-\nwork has the potential for both.  \n                                                 \n30   which would qualify as post-fordist forms of production \n31   as defined in section three 186  European Political Economy Review  \n \n \nThe more employees and unions are involved in the implementation \nprocess, the more likely it is that an innovative type of teamwork \nwill be introduced. The important fact is that there are win-win \nsituations. There are examples of teamwork that have improved \nemployees\u2019 job satisfaction and productivity at the same time. Even \nif the introduction of teamwork leads to an intensification of work, \nworkers\u2019 job satisfaction might increase nevertheless if this is com-\npensated for by greater levels of skill and increased autonomy. Mer-\ncedes A-City an example for this.  \nYet, while changes in the organisation of work implicated by the in-\ntroduction of teamwork are considerable, the examples studied here \nsuggest that these changes remain firmly within the fordist produc-\ntion model. Cases like Uddevalla and Kalmar, where the taylorist \ndivision of labour is transcended, seem to be\n32 exceptions. Thus, \njudging from the cases presented here, it seems premature, to say \nthe least, to announce the imminent death of fordism. \n \nAcknowledgements \nI would like to thank Detlef Gerst, Martyn Wright, Mike Terry, my \nfriends Elias Galinos and Konstantinos Tzioumis, as well as two \nanonymous referees for giving me helpful advice and comments. \nFurthermore, I wish to thank my interviewees for their time, and the \npeople at Opel, Vauxhall, and the IG Metall, as well as Detlef Gerst \nfrom the SOFI in G\u00f6ttingen for giving me access to various unpub-\nlished sources.  \nFinally, I am grateful for financial support by the German Aca-\ndemic Exchange Council and the Friedrich Ebert Foundation. \n \nReferences \n \nADLER Paul S (1992), \u201cThe Learning Bureaucracy: New United Motors Manu-\nfacturing Inc\u201d, in: STAW Barry M/CUMMINGS Leslie L (Eds.), Research in \nOrganizational Behavior, Greenwich, CT, JAI Press, pp. 111-194. \n                                                 \n32   or rather have been \u2013 both plants were closed down Wergin: Teamwork in the Automobile Industry 187 \nADLER Paul S (1995), \u201cDemocratic Taylorism: The Toyota Production System \nat Nummi\u201d, in: BABSON Steve (Ed.), Lean Work, Empowerment and Exploi-\ntation in the Global industry, Detroit, MI, Wayne State University Press, pp. \n207-219. \nANTONI Conny H (1994), \u201cGruppenarbeit - Mehr als ein Konzept.
