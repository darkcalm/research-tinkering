      "title": "Thirty Years of Machine Learning: The Road to Pareto-Optimal Wireless\n  Networks",
      "abstract": "Future wireless networks have a substantial potential in terms of supporting\na broad range of complex compelling applications both in military and civilian\nfields, where the users are able to enjoy high-rate, low-latency, low-cost and\nreliable information services. Achieving this ambitious goal requires new radio\ntechniques for adaptive learning and intelligent decision making because of the\ncomplex heterogeneous nature of the network structures and wireless services.\nMachine learning (ML) algorithms have great success in supporting big data\nanalytics, efficient parameter estimation and interactive decision making.\nHence, in this article, we review the thirty-year history of ML by elaborating\non supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning and deep\nlearning. Furthermore, we investigate their employment in the compelling\napplications of wireless networks, including heterogeneous networks (HetNets),\ncognitive radios (CR), Internet of things (IoT), machine to machine networks\n(M2M), and so on. This article aims for assisting the readers in clarifying the\nmotivation and methodology of the various ML algorithms, so as to invoke them\nfor hitherto unexplored services as well as scenarios of future wireless\nnetworks.Comment: 46 pages, 22 fig",

      "title": "Fog-enabled Edge Learning for Cognitive Content-Centric Networking in 5G",
      "abstract": "By caching content at network edges close to the users, the content-centric\nnetworking (CCN) has been considered to enforce efficient content retrieval and\ndistribution in the fifth generation (5G) networks. Due to the volume,\nvelocity, and variety of data generated by various 5G users, an urgent and\nstrategic issue is how to elevate the cognitive ability of the CCN to realize\ncontext-awareness, timely response, and traffic offloading for 5G applications.\nIn this article, we envision that the fundamental work of designing a cognitive\nCCN (C-CCN) for the upcoming 5G is exploiting the fog computing to\nassociatively learn and control the states of edge devices (such as phones,\nvehicles, and base stations) and in-network resources (computing, networking,\nand caching). Moreover, we propose a fog-enabled edge learning (FEL) framework\nfor C-CCN in 5G, which can aggregate the idle computing resources of the\nneighbouring edge devices into virtual fogs to afford the heavy delay-sensitive\nlearning tasks. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to jointly\nprocessing sensed environmental data, dealing with the massive content\nstatistics, and enforcing the mobility control at network edges, the FEL makes\nit possible for mobile users to cognitively share their data over the C-CCN in\n5G. To validate the feasibility of proposed framework, we design two\nFEL-advanced cognitive services for C-CCN in 5G: 1) personalized network\nacceleration, 2) enhanced mobility management. Simultaneously, we present the\nsimulations to show the FEL's efficiency on serving for the mobile users'\ndelay-sensitive content retrieval and distribution in 5G.Comment: Submitted to IEEE Communications Magzine, under review, Feb. 09, 201",

      "title": "A review of architectures and concepts for intelligence in future electric energy system",
      "abstract": "Renewable energy sources are one key enabler to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and to cope with the anthropogenic climate change. Their intermittent behavior and limited storage capabilities present a new challenge to power system operators to maintain power quality and reliability. Additional technical complexity arises from the large number of small distributed generation units and their allocation within the power system. Market liberalization and changing regulatory framework lead to additional organizational complexity. As a result, the design and operation of the future electric energy system have to be redefined. Sophisticated information and communication architectures, automation concepts, and control approaches are necessary in order to manage the higher complexity of so-called smart grids. This paper provides an overview of the state of the art and recent developments enabling higher intelligence in future smart grids. The integration of renewable sources and storage systems into the power grids is analyzed. Energy management and demand response methods and important automation paradigms and domain standards are also reviewed.info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio",
