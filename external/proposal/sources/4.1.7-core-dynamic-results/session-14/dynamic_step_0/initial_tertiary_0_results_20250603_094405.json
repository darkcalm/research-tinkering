      "abstract": "The operation of the power grid is becoming more stressed, due to the\naddition of new large loads represented by Electric Vehicles (EVs) and a more\nintermittent supply due to the incorporation of renewable sources. As a\nconsequence, the coordination and control of projected EV demand in a network\nof fast charging stations becomes a critical and challenging problem.\n  In this paper, we introduce a game theoretic based decentralized control\nmechanism to alleviate negative impacts from the EV demand. The proposed\nmechanism takes into consideration the non-uniform spatial distribution of EVs\nthat induces uneven power demand at each charging facility, and aims to: (i)\navoid straining grid resources by offering price incentives so that customers\naccept being routed to less busy stations, (ii) maximize total revenue by\nserving more customers with the same amount of grid resources, and (iii)\nprovide charging service to customers with a certain level of\nQuality-of-Service (QoS), the latter defined as the long term customer blocking\nprobability. We examine three scenarios of increased complexity that gradually\napproximate real world settings. The obtained results show that the proposed\nframework leads to substantial performance improvements in terms of the\naforementioned goals, when compared to current state of affairs.Comment: Accepted for Publication in IEEE Transactions on Smart Gri",

      "abstract": "This paper considers decentralized control and optimization methodologies for\nlarge populations of systems, consisting of several agents with different\nindividual behaviors, constraints and interests, and affected by the aggregate\nbehavior of the overall population. For such large-scale systems, the theory of\naggregative and mean field games has been established and successfully applied\nin various scientific disciplines. While the existing literature addresses the\ncase of unconstrained agents, we formulate deterministic mean field control\nproblems in the presence of heterogeneous convex constraints for the individual\nagents, for instance arising from agents with linear dynamics subject to convex\nstate and control constraints. We propose several model-free feedback\niterations to compute in a decentralized fashion a mean field Nash equilibrium\nin the limit of infinite population size. We apply our methods to the\nconstrained linear quadratic deterministic mean field control problem and to\nthe constrained mean field charging control problem for large populations of\nplug-in electric vehicles.Comment: IEEE Trans. on Automatic Control (cond. accepted",
