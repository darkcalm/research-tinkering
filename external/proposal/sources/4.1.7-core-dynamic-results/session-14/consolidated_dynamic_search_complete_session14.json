        "title": "A survey on smart grid communication infrastructures: Motivations, requirements and challenges",
        "abstract": "A communication infrastructure is an essential part to the success of the emerging smart grid. A scalable and pervasive communication infrastructure is crucial in both construction and operation of a smart grid. In this paper, we present the background and motivation of communication infrastructures in smart grid systems. We also summarize major requirements that smart grid communications must meet. From the experience of several industrial trials on smart grid with communication infrastructures, we expect that the traditional carbon fuel based power plants can cooperate with emerging distributed renewable energy such as wind, solar, etc, to reduce the carbon fuel consumption and consequent green house gas such as carbon dioxide emission. The consumers can minimize their expense on energy by adjusting their intelligent home appliance operations to avoid the peak hours and utilize the renewable energy instead. We further explore the challenges for a communication infrastructure as the part of a complex smart grid system. Since a smart grid system might have over millions of consumers and devices, the demand of its reliability and security is extremely critical. Through a communication infrastructure, a smart grid can improve power reliability and quality to eliminate electricity blackout. Security is a challenging issue since the on-going smart grid systems facing increasing vulnerabilities as more and more automation, remote monitoring/controlling and supervision entities are interconnected. \u00a9 1998-2012 IEEE",

        "title": "Algorithms for advance bandwidth reservation in media production networks",
        "abstract": "Media production generally requires many geographically distributed actors (e.g., production houses, broadcasters, advertisers) to exchange huge amounts of raw video and audio data. Traditional distribution techniques, such as dedicated point-to-point optical links, are highly inefficient in terms of installation time and cost. To improve efficiency, shared media production networks that connect all involved actors over a large geographical area, are currently being deployed. The traffic in such networks is often predictable, as the timing and bandwidth requirements of data transfers are generally known hours or even days in advance. As such, the use of advance bandwidth reservation (AR) can greatly increase resource utilization and cost efficiency. In this paper, we propose an Integer Linear Programming formulation of the bandwidth scheduling problem, which takes into account the specific characteristics of media production networks, is presented. Two novel optimization algorithms based on this model are thoroughly evaluated and compared by means of in-depth simulation results",

        "abstract": "This report discusses a new maturity model that regulators and utilities can use to guide and expand demand flexibility programs and enable the resources to provide more grid services. The model has six demand flexibility categories: planning and design; customer engagement; program operations; evaluation, measurement and verification; distributed energy resource orchestration; and data infrastructure. Within each category, capabilities are identified and described on a maturity scale that ranges from performing below expectations to improving on best practices",

        "abstract": "This paper presents one of the first real-life demonstrations of coordinated\nand distributed resource control for secondary frequency response in a power\ndistribution grid. We conduct a series of tests with up to 69 heterogeneous\nactive devices consisting of air handling units, unidirectional and\nbidirectional electric vehicle charging stations, a battery energy storage\nsystem, and 107 passive devices consisting of building loads and photovoltaic\ngenerators. Actuation commands for the test devices are obtained by solving an\neconomic dispatch problem at every regulation instant using distributed\nratio-consensus, primal-dual, and Newton-like algorithms. The distributed\ncontrol setup consists of a set of Raspberry Pi end-points exchanging messages\nvia an ethernet switch. The problem formulation minimizes the sum of device\ncosts while tracking the setpoints provided by the system operator. We\ndemonstrate accurate and fast real-time distributed computation of the\noptimization solution and effective tracking of the regulation signal by\nmeasuring physical device outputs over 40-minute time horizons. We also perform\nan economic benefit analysis which confirms eligibility to participate in an\nancillary services market and demonstrates up to $53K of potential annual\nrevenue for the selected population of devices",

        "abstract": "The increasing adoption of distributed energy resources (DERs) and smart grid technologies (SGTs) by end-user retail customers is changing significantly both technical and economic operations in the distribution grid. The next-generation retail electricity market will promote decentralization, efficiency, and competitiveness by accommodating existing and new agents through new business models and transactive approaches in an advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). However, these changes will bring several technical challenges to be addressed in transmission and distribution systems. Considerable activities have been carried out worldwide to study the impacts of integrating DERs into the grid and in the wholesale electricity market. However, the big vision and framework of the next-generation retail market in the context of DERs is still unclear. This paper aims to present a brief review of the present retail electricity market, some recent developments, and a comprehensive vision of the next-generation retail electricity market by describing its expected characteristics, challenges, needs, and future research topics to be addressed. A framework of integrating retail and wholesale electricity markets is also presented and discussed. The proposed vision and framework particularly highlight the necessity of new business models and regulatory initiatives to establish decentralized markets for DERs at the retail level as well as advances in technology and infrastructure necessary to allow the widespread use of DERs in active and effective ways",

In den meisten F\u00e4llen sind die Abl\u00e4ufe\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnicht nur durch den physischen Aufbau der Produktionsanlage, sondern auch durch\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdie spezielle zugeschnittene Programmierung der Anlagensteuerung fest\n\t\t\t\t\t\tvorgegeben. \u00c4nderungen m\u00fcssen aufw\u00e4ndig in einer Vielzahl von Systemen\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnachgezogen werden.

Im Vergleich zu\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   existierenden Modellen von Produktionsanlagen werden weniger limitierende\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Annahmen gestellt.

Der Algorithmus verbindet Techniken f\u00fcr die\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   kombinatorische und die kontinuierliche Optimierung: Je nach Detailgrad und\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Ausgestaltung des modellierten Szenarios kann der identische Algorithmus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   kombinatorische Fertigungsfeinplanung (Scheduling) vornehmen, weltweite\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Lieferbeziehungen unter Einbezug von Unsicherheiten und Risiko optimieren und\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   physikalische Prozesse pr\u00e4diktiv regeln. Daf\u00fcr werden Techniken der\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Monte-Carlo Baumsuche (die auch bei Deepminds Alpha Go zum Einsatz kommen)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   weiterentwickelt. Durch Ausnutzung zus\u00e4tzlicher Struktur in den Modellen\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   skaliert der Ansatz auch auf gro\u00dfe Szenarien.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3. Der Planungsalgorithmus wird auf die verteilte Optimierung durch unabh\u00e4ngige\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Agenten \u00fcbertragen. Daf\u00fcr wird die sogenannte \"Nutzen-Propagation\" als\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Koordinations-Mechanismus entwickelt. Diese ist von der Belief-Propagation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   zur Inferenz in Probabilistischen Graphischen Modellen inspiriert. Jeder\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   teilnehmende Agent hat einen lokalen Handlungsraum, in dem er den\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Systemzustand beobachten und handelnd eingreifen kann. Die Agenten sind an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   der Maximierung der Gesamtwohlfahrt \u00fcber alle Agenten hinweg interessiert.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Die daf\u00fcr notwendige Kooperation entsteht \u00fcber den Austausch von Nachrichten\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   zwischen benachbarten Agenten. Die Nachrichten beschreiben den erwarteten\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Nutzen f\u00fcr ein angenommenes Verhalten im Handlungsraum beider Agenten.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t4. Es wird eine Beschreibung der wiederverwendbaren F\u00e4higkeiten von Maschinen\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   und Anlagen auf Basis formaler Beschreibungslogiken entwickelt. Ausgehend von\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   den beschriebenen F\u00e4higkeiten, sowie der vorliegenden Auftr\u00e4ge mit ihren\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   notwendigen Produktionsschritten, werden ausf\u00fchrbare Aktionen abgeleitet. Die\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   ausf\u00fchrbaren Aktionen, mit wohldefinierten Vorbedingungen und Effekten,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   kapseln ben\u00f6tigte Parametrierungen, programmierte Abl\u00e4ufe und die\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Synchronisation von Maschinen zur Laufzeit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDie Ergebnisse zusammenfassend werden Grundlagen f\u00fcr flexible automatisierte\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProduktionssysteme geschaffen -- in einer Werkshalle, aber auch \u00fcber Standorte\n\t\t\t\t\t\tund Organisationen verteilt -- welche die ihnen innewohnenden Freiheitsgrade\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdurch Planung zur Laufzeit und agentenbasierte Koordination gezielt einsetzen\n\t\t\t\t\t\tk\u00f6nnen. Der Bezug zur Praxis wird durch Anwendungsbeispiele hergestellt. Die\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMachbarkeit des Ansatzes wurde mit realen Maschinen im Rahmen des EU-Projekts\n\t\t\t\t\tSkillPro und in einer Simulationsumgebung mit weiteren Szenarien demonstriert",

        "abstract": "In the push to develop smart energy systems, designers have increasingly focused on systems that measure and predict user behavior to effect optimal energy consumption. While such focus is an important component in these systems' success, designers have paid substantially less attention to the people on the other side of the energy system loop-the supervisors of power generation processes. Smart energy systems that leverage pervasive computing could add to these supervisory control operators' workload. They'll have to predict possible power plant load and production changes caused by environmental and plant events, as well as dynamic system adaptation in response to consumer behaviors. Contrary to many assumptions, inserting more automation, including distributed sensors and algorithms to postprocess data, won't necessarily reduce operators' workload or improve system performance",

        "title": "Rethinking the sustainability and institutional governance of electricity access and mini-grids: electricity as a common pool resource",
        "abstract": "Rural mini-grids are viewed as a key technology for providing access to electricity to the billion or more people that lack it by 2030 (in line with the UN\u2019s Sustainable Energy for All commitment). But at present no model for the sustainable management of rural mini-grids exists, which contributes to high failure rates. This paper makes a number of contributions. First, it explores how electricity in mini-grids might be understood as a Common Pool Resource (CPR), opening up potential to learn from the extensive literature on institutional characteristics of sustainable CPR management in the natural resource management literature. Second, it refines Agrawal\u2019s (2001) overarching framework of enabling conditions for sustainable CPR management institutions to develop a framework applicable to rural mini-grid management in developing countries. Thirdly, the utility of this refined framework is demonstrated by applying it to analyse data from 27 semi-structured interviews with actors with expertise in mini-grid development and management in Kenya and 2 field visits to rural mini-grids there. This contributes a nuanced basis for future application of CPR theory to mini-grids and a systematic analysis of institutional challenges and possible solutions, which have hitherto received limited attention in the energy and development literature",

        "abstract": "This project studies the feasibility and implementation options for establishing a regional data archiving system to help monitor\r\nand manage traffic operations and planning for the northeastern Illinois region. It aims to provide a clear guidance to the\r\nregional transportation agencies, from both technical and business perspectives, about building such a comprehensive\r\ntransportation information system. Several implementation alternatives are identified and analyzed. This research is carried\r\nout in three phases.\r\nIn the first phase, existing documents related to ITS deployments in the broader Chicago area are summarized, and a\r\nthorough review is conducted of similar systems across the country. Various stakeholders are interviewed to collect\r\ninformation on all data elements that they store, including the format, system, and granularity. Their perception of a data\r\narchive system, such as potential benefits and costs, is also surveyed. In the second phase, a conceptual design of the\r\ndatabase is developed. This conceptual design includes system architecture, functional modules, user interfaces, and\r\nexamples of usage. In the last phase, the possible business models for the archive system to sustain itself are reviewed. We\r\nestimate initial capital and recurring operational/maintenance costs for the system based on realistic information on the\r\nhardware, software, labor, and resource requirements. We also identify possible revenue opportunities.\r\nA few implementation options for the archive system are summarized in this report; namely:\r\n1. System hosted by a partnering agency\r\n2. System contracted to a university\r\n3. System contracted to a national laboratory\r\n4. System outsourced to a service provider\r\nThe costs, advantages and disadvantages for each of these recommended options are also provided.ICT-R27-22published or submitted for publicationis peer reviewe",

        "title": "COMMUNITY SOLAR ENERGY PROGRAMS: A BRIGHT SPOT FOR JUST ENERGY POLICY?",
        "abstract": "Energy systems are complex, and this complexity requires diverse regulatory forms and strategies of management. Michigan\u2019s energy system is situated within a multi-scalar governance structure reaching from national to local levels. As a result, the process of energy system decision-making can leave out smaller, remote communities and those without the economic, political, and knowledge capital necessary to engage in complex bureaucratic processes. These communities can become subject to high electricity prices and unreliable electrical service from long transmission and distribution lines, raising energy justice concerns. Additionally, resulting from utility regulatory practices, small remote communities are often not afforded the opportunity to explore alternative, local, and environmentally friendly energy generation sources. This dissertation utilizes data collected from two case study sites in Michigan to examine how decisions are made regarding energy system management, who participates in what forms of decision-making, what implications community solar can have for improving energy justice, and the role of energy policy. Specifically, the research attempts to examine how community solar may create more just energy systems and the particular policy and governance dimensions that shape the use of community solar for the pursuit of energy justice. Chapter 2 explores how Michigan investor-owned utilities interpret and implement energy laws to hinder distributed generation proliferation in Michigan. Chapter 3 reflects on the community engaged research process used to determine the viability of a community solar program. It argues for incorporating collaborative governance principles to further improve the community engaged research process to help insert local control and affordability into energy systems. Finally, chapter 4 utilizes and analyzes interview, focus group discussion, and survey data to understand from a community perspective what factors are important for community solar viability. It situates this data within the community social context as it recognizes that perceptions alone do not explain program viability. Energy justice does not apply to just one level of policy making. The subsequent implementation and decision-making process of these existing policies can be determined through collaborative governance strategies, such as community solar, that align with energy justice values",

        "abstract": "The authors describe and analyze an unconventional approach to river basin management in a developing country undergoing rapid economic, political, and institutional change. The founding of the Brantas River Basin Management Corporation (Perum Jasa Tirta I - PJT 1), a national state-owned company for river basin management, initiated an emphasis on river basin management to operate and maintain existing infrastructure, plan and implement the allocation of water, and address problems that affect basin-level water resources. The Brantas River basin is located within the province of East Java in Indonesia. It has an area of approximately 11,800 square kilometers and makes up 25 percent of East Java's land area. The basin's population, which amounts to nearly 15 million, has increased by 53.4 percent over the past 30 years and represents 42.4 percent of East Java's population with a density of 1,249 per square kilometer. A shift has taken place in Indonesia since the mid-1990s from emphasizing infrastructure development to strengthening institutional aspects (hydrology, flood fighting, flood warning, flood management, and so on). The institutional arrangement for water resources management in the Brantas basin through a state-owned corporation is an interesting model. PJT I has achieved results in implementing a reasonably good system of water allocation and management and a reliable flood forecasting system, as well as maintaining major infrastructure in fairly good condition. Managing water quality, catchment conditions, and the river environment, however, are the responsibility of many entities, and there is need for greater coordination and authority to address these issues.Water Supply and Sanitation Governance and Institutions,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Drought Management,Water and Industry,Water Conservation",

        "title": "How to Make Agents and Influence Teammates: Understanding the Social Influence AI Teammates Have in Human-AI Teams",
        "abstract": "The introduction of computational systems in the last few decades has enabled humans to cross geographical, cultural, and even societal boundaries. Whether it was the invention of telephones or file sharing, new technologies have enabled humans to continuously work better together. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has one of the highest levels of potential as one of these technologies. Although AI has a multitude of functions within teaming, such as improving information sciences and analysis, one specific application of AI that has become a critical topic in recent years is the creation of AI systems that act as teammates alongside humans, in what is known as a human-AI team.\nHowever, as AI transitions into teammate roles they will garner new responsibilities and abilities, which ultimately gives them a greater influence over teams\\u27 shared goals and resources, otherwise known as teaming influence. Moreover, that increase in teaming influence will provide AI teammates with a level of social influence. Unfortunately, while research has observed the impact of teaming influence by examining humans\\u27 perception and performance, an explicit and literal understanding of the social influence that facilitates long-term teaming change has yet to be created. This dissertation uses three studies to create a holistic understanding of the underlying social influence that AI teammates possess.\nStudy 1 identifies the fundamental existence of AI teammate social influence and how it pertains to teaming influence. Qualitative data demonstrates that social influence is naturally created as humans actively adapt around AI teammate teaming influence. Furthermore, mixed-methods results demonstrate that the alignment of AI teammate teaming influence with a human\\u27s individual motives is the most critical factor in the acceptance of AI teammate teaming influence in existing teams.\nStudy 2 further examines the acceptance of AI teammate teaming and social influence and how the design of AI teammates and humans\\u27 individual differences can impact this acceptance. The findings of Study 2 show that humans have the greatest levels of acceptance of AI teammate teaming influence that is comparative to their own teaming influence on a single task, but the acceptance of AI teammate teaming influence across multiple tasks generally decreases as teaming influence increases. Additionally, coworker endorsements are shown to increase the acceptance of high levels of AI teammate teaming influence, and humans that perceive the capabilities of technology, in general, to be greater are potentially more likely to accept AI teammate teaming influence.\nFinally, Study 3 explores how the teaming and social influence possessed by AI teammates change when presented in a team that also contains teaming influence from multiple human teammates, which means social influence between humans also exists. Results demonstrate that AI teammate social influence can drive humans to prefer and observe their human teammates over their AI teammates, but humans\\u27 behavioral adaptations are more centered around their AI teammates than their human teammates. These effects demonstrate that AI teammate social influence, when in the presence of human-human teaming and social influence, retains potency, but its effects are different when impacting either perception or behavior.\nThe above three studies fill a currently under-served research gap in human-AI teaming, which is both the understanding of AI teammate social influence and humans\\u27 acceptance of it. In addition, each study conducted within this dissertation synthesizes its findings and contributions into actionable design recommendations that will serve as foundational design principles to allow the initial acceptance of AI teammates within society. Therefore, not only will the research community benefit from the results discussed throughout this dissertation, but so too will the developers, designers, and human teammates of human-AI teams",

        "abstract": "Efforts in levering Artificial Intelligence (AI) in decision support systems\nhave disproportionately focused on technological advancements, often\noverlooking the alignment between algorithmic outputs and human expectations.\nTo address this, explainable AI promotes AI development from a more\nhuman-centered perspective. Determining what information AI should provide to\naid humans is vital, however, how the information is presented, e. g., the\nsequence of recommendations and the solicitation of interpretations, is equally\ncrucial. This motivates the need to more precisely study Human-AI interaction\nas a pivotal component of AI-based decision support. While several empirical\nstudies have evaluated Human-AI interactions in multiple application domains in\nwhich interactions can take many forms, there is not yet a common vocabulary to\ndescribe human-AI interaction protocols. To address this gap, we describe the\nresults of a systematic review of the AI-assisted decision making literature,\nanalyzing 105 selected articles, which grounds the introduction of a taxonomy\nof interaction patterns that delineate various modes of human-AI interactivity.\nWe find that current interactions are dominated by simplistic collaboration\nparadigms and report comparatively little support for truly interactive\nfunctionality. Our taxonomy serves as a valuable tool to understand how\ninteractivity with AI is currently supported in decision-making contexts and\nfoster deliberate choices of interaction designs",

        "abstract": "Multi-modal human\u2013machine interfaces have recently undergone a remarkable transformation, progressing from simple human\u2013robot interaction (HRI) to more advanced human\u2013robot collaboration (HRC) and, ultimately, evolving into the concept of human\u2013robot teaming (HRT). The aim of this work is to delineate a progressive path in this evolving transition. A structured, position-oriented review is proposed. Rather than aiming for an exhaustive survey, our objective is to propose a structured approach in a field that has seen diverse and sometimes divergent definitions of HRI/C/T in the literature. This conceptual review seeks to establish a unified and systematic framework for understanding these paradigms, offering clarity and coherence amidst their evolving complexities. We focus on integrating multiple sensory modalities \u2014 such as visual, aural, and tactile inputs \u2014 within human\u2013machine interfaces. Central to our approach is a running use case of a warehouse workflow, which illustrates key aspects including modelling, control, communication, and technological integration. Additionally, we investigate recent advancements in machine learning and sensing technologies, emphasising robot perception, human intention recognition, and collaborative task engagement. Current challenges and future directions, including ethical considerations, user acceptance, and the need for explainable systems, are also addressed. By providing a structured pathway from HRI to HRT, this work aims to foster a deeper understanding and facilitate further advancements in human\u2013machine interaction paradigms.publishedVersio",

        "title": "Foundations of Human-Aware Planning -- A Tale of Three Models",
        "abstract": "abstract: A critical challenge in the design of AI systems that operate with humans in the loop is to be able to model the intentions and capabilities of the humans, as well as their beliefs and expectations of the AI system itself. This allows the AI system to be \"human- aware\" -- i.e. the human task model enables it to envisage desired roles of the human in joint action, while the human mental model allows it to anticipate how its own actions are perceived from the point of view of the human. In my research, I explore how these concepts of human-awareness manifest themselves in the scope of planning or sequential decision making with humans in the loop. To this end, I will show (1) how the AI agent can leverage the human task model to generate symbiotic behavior; and (2) how the introduction of the human mental model in the deliberative process of the AI agent allows it to generate explanations for a plan or resort to explicable plans when explanations are not desired. The latter is in addition to traditional notions of human-aware planning which typically use the human task model alone and thus enables a new suite of capabilities of a human-aware AI agent. Finally, I will explore how the AI agent can leverage emerging mixed-reality interfaces to realize effective channels of communication with the human in the loop.Dissertation/ThesisDoctoral Dissertation Computer Science 201",

        "abstract": "AI alignment aims to make AI systems behave in line with human intentions and\nvalues. As AI systems grow more capable, so do risks from misalignment. To\nprovide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the alignment field, in this\nsurvey, we delve into the core concepts, methodology, and practice of\nalignment. First, we identify four principles as the key objectives of AI\nalignment: Robustness, Interpretability, Controllability, and Ethicality\n(RICE). Guided by these four principles, we outline the landscape of current\nalignment research and decompose them into two key components: forward\nalignment and backward alignment. The former aims to make AI systems aligned\nvia alignment training, while the latter aims to gain evidence about the\nsystems' alignment and govern them appropriately to avoid exacerbating\nmisalignment risks. On forward alignment, we discuss techniques for learning\nfrom feedback and learning under distribution shift. On backward alignment, we\ndiscuss assurance techniques and governance practices.\n  We also release and continually update the website (www.alignmentsurvey.com)\nwhich features tutorials, collections of papers, blog posts, and other\nresources.Comment: Continually updated, including weak-to-strong generalization and\n  socio-technical thinking. 58 pages (excluding bibliography), 801 reference",

        "title": "From Assistance to Empowerment: Human-AI Collaboration in High-Risk Decision Making",
        "abstract": "The increasing availability of large amounts of valuable data and the development of ever more powerful machine learning (ML) algorithms enable ML systems to quickly and independently identify complex relationships in data. As a result, ML systems not only generate new knowledge, but also offer significant potential to augment human capabilities and assist decision makers in challenging tasks.\n\nIn high-risk areas such as aviation or healthcare, humans retain final decision-making responsibility, but will increasingly collaborate with ML systems to improve decision-making processes. However, since ML systems rely on statistical approaches, they are susceptible to error, and the complexity of modern algorithms often renders the output of ML systems opaque to humans. While initial approaches from the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aim to make the output of ML systems more understandable and comprehensible to humans, current research investigating the impact of ML systems on human decision makers is limited and lacks approaches on how humans can improve their capabilities through collaboration to make better decisions in the long run. To fully exploit the potential of ML systems in high-risk areas, both humans and ML systems should be able to learn from each other to enhance their performance in the context of collaboration. Furthermore, it is essential to design effective collaboration that considers the unique characteristics of ML systems and enables humans to critically assess system decisions. This dissertation comprises five published papers that use a mixed-methods study, two quantitative experiments and two qualitative design science research (DSR) studies to explore the collaboration and bilateral influences between humans and ML systems in decision-making contexts within high-risk areas from three perspectives: (1) the human perspective, (2) the ML system perspective, and (3) the collaborative perspective.\n\nFrom a human perspective, this dissertation examines how humans can learn from ML systems in collaboration to enhance their own capabilities and avoid the risk of false learning due to erroneous ML output. In a mixed-methods study, radiologists segmented 690 brain tumors in MRI scans supported by either high-performing or low-performing ML systems, which provided explainable or non-explainable output design. The study shows that human decision makers can learn from ML systems to improve their decision performance and confidence. However, incorrect system outputs also lead to false learning and pose risks for decision makers. Explanations from the XAI field can significantly improve the learning success of radiologists and prevent false learning in the case of incorrect ML system output. In fact, some radiologists were even able to learn from mistakes made by low-performing ML systems when local explanations were provided with the system output. This study provides first empirical insights into the human learning potential in the context of collaborating with ML systems. The finding that explainable design of ML systems enables radiologists to identify erroneous output may facilitate earlier adoption of explainable ML systems that can improve their performance over time.\n\nThe ML system perspective, on the other hand, examines how ML systems must be designed to respond flexibly to changes in human problem perception and their dynamic deployment environment. This allows the systems to also learn from humans and ensures reliable system performance in dynamic collaborative environments. Through 15 qualitative interviews with data science and ML experts in the context of a DSR study, challenges for the long-term deployment of ML systems are identified. The results show that the requirements for flexible adaptation of systems in long-term use must be established in the early phases of the ML development process. Tangible design requirements and principles for ML systems that can learn from their environment and humans are derived for all phases of the CRISP-ML(Q) process model for the development and deployment of ML models. Implementing these principles allows ML systems to maintain or even improve their performance in the long run despite occurring changes, thus creating the prerequisites for a sustainable lifecycle of ML systems.\n\nFinally, the collaborative perspective examines how the collaboration between humans and ML systems should be designed to account for the unique characteristics of ML systems, such as error proneness and opacity, as well as the cognitive biases that are inherent to human decision making. In this context, pilots were provided with different ML systems for the visual detection of other aircraft in the airspace during 222 recorded flight simulations. The experiment examines the influence of different ML error types and XAI approaches in collaboration, and shows that an explainable output design can significantly reduce ML error-induced pilot trust and performance degradation for individual error types. However, processing explanations from the XAI field increases the pilot\u2019s mental workload. While ML errors erode the trust of human decision makers, a DSR study is conducted to derive design principles for acceptance-promoting artifacts for collaboration between humans and ML systems. Finally, the last part of the analysis shows how cognitive biases such as the IKEA effect cause humans to overvalue the results of collaboration with ML systems when a high level of personal effort is invested in the collaboration. The findings provide a broad foundation for designing effective human-AI collaboration in organizations, especially in high-risk areas where humans will be involved in decision making for the long term.\n\nOverall, the papers show how by designing effective collaboration, both humans and ML systems can benefit from each other in the long run and enhance their own capabilities. The explainable design of ML system outputs can serve as a catalyst for the adoption of ML systems, especially in high-risk areas. This dissertation defines novel requirements for the collaboration between humans and ML systems and provides guidance for ML developers, scientists, and organizations that aspire to involve both human decision makers and ML systems in decision-making processes and ensure high and robust performance in the long term",

        "abstract": "The energy sector will undergo fundamental changes over the next ten years. Prices for fossil energy resources are continuously increasing, there is an urgent need to reduce CO2 emissions, and the United States and European Union are strongly motivated to become more independent from foreign energy imports. These factors will lead to installation of large numbers of distributed renewable energy generators, which are often intermittent in nature. This trend conflicts with the current power grid control infrastructure and strategies, where a few centralized control centers manage a limited number of large power plants such that their output meets the energy demands in real time. As the proportion of distributed and intermittent generation capacity increases, this task becomes much harder, especially as the local and regional distribution grids where renewable energy generators are usually installed are currently virtually unmanaged, lack real time metering and are not built to cope with power flow inversions (yet).\nAll this is about to change, and so the control strategies must be adapted accordingly. While the hierarchical command-and-control approach served well in a world with a few large scale generation facilities and many small consumers, a more flexible, decentralized, and self-organizing control infrastructure will have to be developed that can be actively managed to balance both the large grid as a whole, as well as the many lower voltage sub-grids.\nWe propose a competitive simulation test bed to stimulate research and development of electronic agents that help manage these tasks. Participants in the competition will develop intelligent agents that are responsible to level energy supply from generators with energy demand from consumers. The competition is designed to closely model reality by bootstrapping the simulation environment with real historic load, generation, and weather data. The simulation environment will provide a low-risk platform that combines simulated markets and real-world data to develop solutions that can be applied to help building the self-organizing intelligent energy grid of the future",

        "abstract": "The quickening propensity of growth within the areas of information and communications technology and energy networks has triggered the emergence of a central idea termed as Internet of Energy (IoE). Such a concept relates the internet of things, which is the term used in describing the usage of sophisticated digital control devices with the capability of transmitting data via IT systems. The concept of an interconnected energy network is being formed in the upcoming days through upgrades in the field of intelligent energy systems to control real-time energy optimization and management. The energy industry has had a sustained expansion, reaching the IoE milestone and continuing to this cutting-edge power system, which is the next generation of IoE. A directional pathway from the traditional power system to the IoE has been conducted in this research work by addressing the importance of integrating the smart transmission and communication infrastructure, smart metering, pricing and energy management scheme. A detailed investigation of the IoE with respect to technical angles, such as communication architecture, IoE on the supply & demand side, and IoE protocol based on fundamental elements and essential technologies has been carried out to indicate the blueprint and jurisdiction complexity. The integration, security and energy management challenges may deviate the performance of the IoE technology that has been focused with proper control issues and solutions. Finally, a directional framework to establish the next-generation IoE system has been constructed with future scopes to insure higher resiliency, cyber-security and stability.Open Access funding is provided by the Qatar National Library",

        "abstract": "The  integration  of  Distributed  Energy  Resource  (DER)  technologies  such  as  heat  pumps, electric vehicles and small-scale generation into the electricity grid at the household level is limited by technical constraints.  This work argues that location is an important aspect for the control and integration of DER and that network topology can inferred without the use of a centralised network model.  It addresses DER integration challenges by presenting a novel approach that uses a decentralised multi-agent system where equipment controllers learn and use their location within the low-voltage section of the power system.\n\n\n\nModels of electrical networks exhibiting technical constraints were developed.  Through theoretical analysis and real network data collection, various sources of location data were identified  and  new  geographical  and  electrical  techniques  were  developed  for  deriving  network topology using Global Positioning System (GPS) and 24-hour voltage logs.  The multi-agent system paradigm and societal structures were examined as an approach to a multi-stakeholder domain and congregations were used as an aid to decentralisation in a non-hierarchical, non-market-based  approach.   Through  formal  description  of  the  agent  attitude  INTEND2, the novel  technique  of  Intention  Transfer  was  applied  to  an  agent  congregation  to  provide  an opt-in, collaborative system.\n\n\n\nTest  facilities  for  multi-agent  systems  were  developed  and  culminated  in  a  new  embedded controller test platform that integrated a real-time dynamic electrical network simulator to provide a full-feedback system integrated with control hardware. Finally, a multi-agent control system  was  developed  and  implemented  that  used  location  data  in  providing  demand-side response to a voltage excursion, with the goals of improving power quality, reducing generator disconnections, and deferring network reinforcement.\n\n\n\nThe resulting communicating and self-organising energy agent community, as demonstrated on a unique hardware-in-the-loop platform, provides an application model and test facility to inspire agent-based, location-aware smart grid applications across the power systems domain",

        "title": "Emergent Behaviors in a Resilient Logistics Supply Chain",
        "abstract": "This PhD dissertation addresses vulnerabilities in logistics supply chains, such as disruptions from pandemics, natural disasters, and geopolitical tensions. It underscores the complexity of supply chains, likening them to socio-technical systems where resilience is key for managing unexpected events and thriving amidst adversity. The focus is on leveraging smart business objects\u2014exemplified by \u201csmart pallets\u201d with sensing and computational capabilities\u2014to augment real-time decision-making and resilience in supply chains. When strategically positioned within the supply network, these smart pallets can provide key insights into the movement of goods, enabling a rapid response to disruptions through real-time monitoring and predictive analytics. The dissertation investigates centralized, decentralized, and hybrid approaches to decision-making within these networks. Centralized methods ensure uniformity but may neglect local specifics, while decentralized ones offer adaptability at the risk of inconsistency. A hybrid model seeks to balance these extremes, combining broad guidelines with local autonomy for optimal resilience. This research aims to explore how such smart objects can anticipate and react to emergent behaviors, thereby augmenting supply chain resilience beyond mere performance indicators to actively managing and adapting to disruptions. Through various chapters, the dissertation offers an exploration, from designing resilient architectures and evaluating business rules in real-time to mining these rules from data and adapting them to evolving circumstances. Overall, this work presents a nuanced view of resilience in supply chains, emphasizing the adaptability of business rules, the importance of technological evolution alongside organizational practices, and the potential of integrating novel techniques such as process mining with multi-agent systems for better decision-making and operational efficiency",

        "title": "Renewable Energy in the Context of Sustainable Development",
        "abstract": "Historically, economic development has been strongly correlated with increasing energy use and growth of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Renewable energy (RE) can help decouple that correlation, contributing to sustainable development (SD). In addition, RE offers the opportunity to improve access to modern energy services for the poorest members of society, which is crucial for the achievement of any single of the eight Millennium Development Goals.\nTheoretical concepts of SD can provide useful frameworks to assess the interactions between SD and RE. SD addresses concerns about relationships between human society and nature. Traditionally, SD has been framed in the three-pillar model\u2014Economy, Ecology, and Society\u2014allowing a schematic categorization of development goals, with the three pillars being interdependent and mutually reinforcing. Within another conceptual framework, SD can be oriented along a continuum between the two paradigms of weak sustainability and strong sustainability. The two paradigms differ in assumptions about the substitutability of natural and human-made capital. RE can contribute to the development goals of the three-pillar model and can be assessed in terms of both weak and strong SD, since RE utilization is defined as sustaining natural capital as long as its resource use does not reduce the potential for future harvest.\nThe relationship between RE and SD can be viewed as a hierarchy of goals and constraints that involve both global and regional or local considerations. Though the exact contribution of RE to SD has to be evaluated in a country specifi c context, RE offers the opportunity to contribute to a number of important SD goals: (1) social and economic development; (2) energy access; (3) energy security; (4) climate change mitigation and the reduction of environmental and health impacts. The mitigation of dangerous anthropogenic climate change is seen as one strong driving force behind the increased use of RE worldwide. The chapter provides an overview of the scientific literature on the relationship between these four SD goals and RE and, at times, fossil and nuclear energy technologies. The assessments are based on different methodological tools, including bottom-up indicators derived from attributional lifecycle assessments (LCA) or energy statistics, dynamic integrated modelling approaches, and qualitative analyses.\nCountries at different levels of development have different incentives and socioeconomic SD goals to advance RE. The creation of employment opportunities and actively promoting structural change in the economy are seen, especially in industrialized countries, as goals that support the promotion of RE. However, the associated costs are a major factor determining the desirability of RE to meet increasing energy demand and concerns have been voiced that increased energy prices might endanger industrializing countries\u2019 development prospects; this underlines the need for a concomitant discussion about the details of an international burden-sharing regime. Still, decentralized grids based on RE have expanded and already improved energy access in developing countries. Under favorable conditions, cost savings in comparison to non-RE use exist, in particular in remote areas and in poor rural areas lacking centralized energy access. In addition, non-electrical RE technologies offer opportunities for modernization of energy services, for example, using solar energy for water heating and crop drying, biofuels for transportation, biogas and modern biomass for heating, cooling, cooking and lighting, and wind for water pumping. RE deployment can contribute to energy security by diversifying energy sources and diminishing dependence on a limited number of suppliers, therefore reducing the economy\u2019s vulnerability to price volatility. Many developing countries specifically link energy access and security issues to include stability and reliability of local supply in their definition of energy security.\nSupporting the SD goal to mitigate environmental impacts from energy systems, RE technologies can provide important benefits compared to fossil fuels, in particular regarding GHG emissions. Maximizing these benefits often depends on the specific technology, management, and site characteristics associated with each RE project, especially with respect to land use change (LUC) impacts. Lifecycle assessments for electricity generation indicate that GHG emissions from RE technologies are, in general, considerably lower than those associated with fossil fuel options, and in a range of conditions, less than fossil fuels employing carbon capture and storage (CCS). The maximum estimate for concentrating solar power (CSP), geothermal, hydropower, ocean and wind energy is less than or equal to 100 g CO2eq/kWh, and median values for all RE range from 4 to 46 g CO2eq/kWh. The GHG balances of bioenergy production, however, have considerable uncertainties, mostly related to land management and LUC. Excluding LUC, most bioenergy systems reduce GHG emissions compared to fossil-fueled systems and can lead to avoided GHG emissions from residues and wastes in landfill disposals and co-products; the combination of bioenergy with CCS may provide for further reductions. For transport fuels, some first-generation biofuels result in relatively modest GHG mitigation potential, while most next-generation biofuels could provide greater climate benefits. To optimize benefits from bioenergy production, it is critical to reduce uncertainties and to consider ways to mitigate the risk of bioenergy-induced LUC.\nRE technologies can also offer benefits with respect to air pollution and health. Non-combustion-based RE power generation technologies have the potential to significantly reduce local and regional air pollution and lower associated health impacts compared to fossil-based power generation. Impacts on water and biodiversity, however, depend on local conditions. In areas where water scarcity is already a concern, non-thermal RE technologies or thermal RE technologies using dry cooling can provide energy services without additional stress on water resources. Conventional water-cooled thermal power plants may be especially vulnerable to conditions of water scarcity and climate change. Hydropower and some bioenergy systems are dependent on water availability, and can either increase competition or mitigate water scarcity. RE specific impacts on biodiversity may be positive or negative; the degree of these impacts will be determined by site-specific conditions. Accident risks of RE technologies are not negligible, but the technologies\u2019 often decentralized structure strongly limits the potential for disastrous consequences in terms of fatalities. However, dams associated with some hydropower projects may create a specific risk depending on site-specific factors.\nThe scenario literature that describes global mitigation pathways for RE deployment can provide some insights into associated SD implications. Putting an upper limit on future GHG emissions results in welfare losses (usually measured as gross domestic product or consumption foregone), disregarding the costs of climate change impacts. These welfare losses are based on assumptions about the availability and costs of mitigation technologies and increase when the availability of technological alternatives for constraining GHGs, for example, RE technologies, is limited. Scenario analyses show that developing countries are likely to see most of the expansion of RE production. Increasing energy access is not necessarily beneficial for all aspects of SD, as a shift to modern energy away from, for example, traditional biomass could simply be a shift to fossil fuels. In general, available scenario analyses highlight the role of policies and finance for increased energy access, even though forced shifts to RE that would provide access to modern energy services could negatively affect household budgets. To the extent that RE deployment in mitigation scenarios contributes to diversifying the energy portfolio, it has the potential to enhance energy security by making the energy system less susceptible to (sudden) energy supply disruption. In scenarios, this role of RE will vary with the energy form. With appropriate carbon mitigation policies in place, electricity generation can be relatively easily decarbonized through RE sources that have the potential to replace concentrated and increasingly scarce fossil fuels in the building and industry sectors. By contrast, the demand for liquid fuels in the transport sector remains inelastic if no technological breakthrough can be achieved. Therefore oil and related energy security concerns are likely to continue to play a role in the future global energy system; as compared to today these will be seen more prominently in developing countries. In order to take account of environmental and health impacts from energy systems, several models have included explicit representation of these, such as sulphate pollution. Some scenario results show that climate policy can help drive improvements in local air pollution (i.e., particulate matter), but air pollution reduction policies alone do not necessarily drive reductions in GHG emissions. Another implication of some potential energy trajectories is the possible diversion of land to support biofuel production. Scenario results have pointed at the possibility that climate policy could drive widespread deforestation if not accompanied by other policy measures, with land use being shifted to bioenergy crops with possibly adverse SD implications, including GHG emissions. 712 Renewable Energy in the Context of Sustainable Development Chapter 9 The integration of RE policies and measures in SD strategies at various levels can help overcome existing barriers and create opportunities for RE deployment in line with meeting SD goals. In the context of SD, barriers continue to impede RE deployment. Besides market-related and economic barriers, those barriers intrinsically linked to societal and personal values and norms will fundamentally affect the perception and acceptance of RE technologies and related deployment impacts by individuals, groups and societies. Dedicated communication efforts are therefore a crucial component of any transformation strategy and local SD initiatives can play an important role in this context. At international and national levels, strategies should include: the removal of mechanisms that are perceived to work against SD; mechanisms for SD that internalize environmental and social externalities; and RE strategies that support low-carbon, green and sustainable development including leapfrogging.\nThe assessment has shown that RE can contribute to SD to varying degrees; more interdisciplinary research is needed to close existing knowledge gaps. While benefi ts with respect to reduced environmental and health impacts may appear more clear-cut, the exact contribution to, for example, social and economic development is more ambiguous. In order to improve the knowledge regarding the interrelations between SD and RE and to fi nd answers to the question of an effective, economically effi cient and socially acceptable transformation of the energy system, a much closer integration of insights from social, natural and economic sciences (e.g., through risk analysis approaches), refl ecting the different (especially intertemporal, spatial and intra-generational) dimensions of sustainability, is required. So far, the knowledge base is often limited to very narrow views from specifi c branches of research, which do not fully account for the complexity of the issue",

        "title": "Distributed Resources Shift Paradigms on Power System Design, Planning, and Operation: An Application of the GAP Model",
        "abstract": "Power systems have evolved following a century-old paradigm of planning and operating a grid based on large central generation plants connected to load centers through a transmission grid and distribution lines with radial flows. This paradigm is being challenged by the development and diffusion of modular generation and storage technologies. We use a novel approach to assess the sequencing and pacing of centralized, distributed, and off-grid electrification strategies by developing and employing the grid and access planning (GAP) model. GAP is a capacity expansion model to jointly assess operation and investment in utility-scale generation, transmission, distribution, and demand-side resources. This paper conceptually studies the investment and operation decisions for a power system with and without distributed resources. Contrary to the current practice, we find hybrid systems that pair grid connections with distributed energy resources (DERs) are the preferred mode of electricity supply for greenfield expansion under conservative reductions in photovoltaic panel (PV) and energy storage prices. We also find that when distributed PV and storage are employed in power system expansion, there are savings of 15%-20% mostly in capital deferment and reduced diesel use. Results show that enhanced financing mechanisms for DER PV and storage could enable 50%-60% of additional deployment and save 15 /MWh in system costs. These results have important implications to reform current utility business models in developed power systems and to guide the development of electrification strategies in underdeveloped grids",

        "abstract": "Stabilizing greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations will require large-scale transformations in human societies, from the way that we produce and consume energy to how we use the land surface. A natural question in this context is what will be the .transformation pathway. towards stabilization; that is, how do we get from here to there? The topic of this chapter is transformation pathways. The chapter is primarily motivated by three questions. First, what are the near-term and future choices that define transformation pathways, including the goal itself, the emissions pathway to the goal, technologies used for and sectors contributing to mitigation, the nature of international coordination, and mitigation policies? Second, what are the key characteristics of different transformation pathways, including the rates of emissions reductions and deployment of low-carbon energy, the magnitude and timing of aggregate economic costs, and the implications for other policy objectives such as those generally associated with sustainable development? Third, how will actions taken today influence the options that might be available in the future? As part of the assessment in this chapter, data from over 1000 new scenarios published since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) were collected from integrated modelling research groups, many from large-scale model intercomparison studies. In comparison to AR4, new scenarios, both in this AR5 dataset and more broadly in the literature assessed in this chapter, consider more ambitious concentration goals, a wider range of assumptions about technology, and more possibilities for delays in additional global mitigation beyond that of today and fragmented international action",

        "title": "Handshaking Protocol for Distributed Implementation of Reo",
        "abstract": "Reo, an exogenous channel-based coordination language, is a model for service\ncoordination wherein services communicate through connectors formed by joining\nbinary communication channels. In order to establish transactional\ncommunication among services as prescribed by connector semantics, distributed\nports exchange handshaking messages signalling which parties are ready to\nprovide or consume data. In this paper, we present a formal implementation\nmodel for distributed Reo with communication delays and outline ideas for its\nproof of correctness. To reason about Reo implementation formally, we introduce\nTimed Action Constraint Automata (TACA) and explain how to compare TACA with\nexisting automata-based semantics for Reo. We use TACA to describe handshaking\nbehavior of Reo modeling primitives and argue that in any distributed circuit\nremote Reo nodes and channels exposing such behavior commit to perform\ntransitions envisaged by the network semantics.Comment: In Proceedings FOCLASA 2014, arXiv:1502.0315",

        "title": "Evaluating XMPP Communication in IEC 61499-based Distributed Energy\n  Applications",
        "abstract": "The IEC 61499 reference model provides an international standard developed\nspecifically for supporting the creation of distributed event-based automation\nsystems. Functionality is abstracted into function blocks which can be coded\ngraphically as well as via a text-based method. As one of the design goals was\nthe ability to support distributed control applications, communication plays a\ncentral role in the IEC 61499 specification. In order to enable the deployment\nof functionality to distributed platforms, these platforms need to exchange\ndata in a variety of protocols. IEC 61499 realizes the support of these\nprotocols via \"Service Interface Function Blocks\" (SIFBs). In the context of\nsmart grids and energy applications, IEC 61499 could play an important role, as\nthese applications require coordinating several distributed control logics.\nYet, the support of grid-related protocols is a pre-condition for a wide-spread\nutilization of IEC 61499. The eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)\non the other hand is a well-established protocol for messaging, which has\nrecently been adopted for smart grid communication. Thus, SIFBs for XMPP\nfacilitate distributed control applications, which use XMPP for exchanging all\ncontrol relevant data, being realized with the help of IEC 61499. This paper\nintroduces the idea of integrating XMPP into SIFBs, demonstrates the\nprototypical implementation in an open source IEC 61499 platform and provides\nan evaluation of the feasibility of the result.Comment: 2016 IEEE 21st International Conference on Emerging Technologies and\n  Factory Automation (ETFA",

Over the past few years, many EU-funded research projects have addressed the challenges of Transmission System Operators (TSO) and Distribution System Operators (DSO) coordination by implementing different data exchange architectures. This paper presents a review of the ICT architectures implemented for the main coordination schemes demonstrated in such projects. The main used technologies are analyzed, considering the type of data exchanged and the communication link. Finally, the paper presents the different gaps and challenges on TSO-DSO coordination related to ICT architectures that must still be faced, paying especial attention to the expected contribution of the EU-funded OneNet project on this topic.

Such an environment can assist the user in doing tasks that require the use of multiple tools. For example, it can invoke tools on certain input, set processing parameters, await task completion and have tools communicate the resulting output. It can also keep track of files produced by tools and prevent tools from reading and writing to the same file at the same time. The protocol serves as an interface between the tools and a central tool manager. Generally, the manager controls the tools and forms an interface to a human user. The protocol is used to connect our tool manager SQuADT to a variety of tools, hereby allowing these tools to be used on all major software platforms",

        "abstract": "The next years should bring about a rapid transformation of the electricity sector towards high levels of renewable generation. Smart grids are seen as the silver bullet responding to the challenge of integrating renewables, managing flexibility, and keeping the costs down in distribution networks. Network unbundling on the other hand is essential for competition in the liberalized electricity industry. It forces independence of the networks and thereby eliminates concern that incumbent integrated (network) firms discriminate against new entrants. With smart grids the unbundling questions become relevant for distribution networks because active control in smart grids entails discrimination potentials. However, smart grids exhibit coordination needs for system efficiency and unbundling eliminates firm-internal coordination. An independent system operator seems to be an appropriate compromise solution. It eliminates discrimination incentives and serves coordination needs, thereby striking a balance between both competition and efficiency goals",

        "abstract": "Service-based systems are software systems composed of autonomous components or services provided\n\nby different vendors, deployed on remote machines and accessible through the web. One of the\n\nchallenges of modern software engineering is to ensure that such a system behaves as intended by its\n\ndesigner. The Reo coordination language is an extensible notation for formal modeling and execution\n\nof service compositions. Services that have no prior knowledge about each other communicate\n\nthrough advanced channel connectors which guarantee that each participant, service or client, receives\n\nthe right data at the right time. Each channel is a binary relation that imposes synchronization\n\nand data constraints on input and output messages. Furthermore, channels are composed together\n\nto realize arbitrarily complex behavioral protocols. During this process, a designer may introduce\n\nerrors into the connector model or the code for their execution, and thus affect the behavior of a\n\ncomposed service. In this paper, we present an approach for model-based testing of coordination\n\nprotocols designed in Reo. Our approach is based on the input-output conformance (ioco) testing\n\ntheory and exploits the mapping of automata-based semantic models for Reo to equivalent process\n\nalgebra specifications",

We logically classify and analyze\nthree different (but interconnected) kinds of important issues towards this\ngoal, namely foundations, verification and extensions. The aim of this work is\nto individuate the proper questions on the adoption of formal methods for\ndependable composition of Web Services, not necessarily to find the optimal\nanswers.

Achieving this ambitious goal requires new radio\ntechniques for adaptive learning and intelligent decision making because of the\ncomplex heterogeneous nature of the network structures and wireless services.\nMachine learning (ML) algorithms have great success in supporting big data\nanalytics, efficient parameter estimation and interactive decision making.\nHence, in this article, we review the thirty-year history of ML by elaborating\non supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning and deep\nlearning. Furthermore, we investigate their employment in the compelling\napplications of wireless networks, including heterogeneous networks (HetNets),\ncognitive radios (CR), Internet of things (IoT), machine to machine networks\n(M2M), and so on. This article aims for assisting the readers in clarifying the\nmotivation and methodology of the various ML algorithms, so as to invoke them\nfor hitherto unexplored services as well as scenarios of future wireless\nnetworks.Comment: 46 pages, 22 fig",

        "abstract": "By caching content at network edges close to the users, the content-centric\nnetworking (CCN) has been considered to enforce efficient content retrieval and\ndistribution in the fifth generation (5G) networks. Due to the volume,\nvelocity, and variety of data generated by various 5G users, an urgent and\nstrategic issue is how to elevate the cognitive ability of the CCN to realize\ncontext-awareness, timely response, and traffic offloading for 5G applications.\nIn this article, we envision that the fundamental work of designing a cognitive\nCCN (C-CCN) for the upcoming 5G is exploiting the fog computing to\nassociatively learn and control the states of edge devices (such as phones,\nvehicles, and base stations) and in-network resources (computing, networking,\nand caching). Moreover, we propose a fog-enabled edge learning (FEL) framework\nfor C-CCN in 5G, which can aggregate the idle computing resources of the\nneighbouring edge devices into virtual fogs to afford the heavy delay-sensitive\nlearning tasks. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to jointly\nprocessing sensed environmental data, dealing with the massive content\nstatistics, and enforcing the mobility control at network edges, the FEL makes\nit possible for mobile users to cognitively share their data over the C-CCN in\n5G. To validate the feasibility of proposed framework, we design two\nFEL-advanced cognitive services for C-CCN in 5G: 1) personalized network\nacceleration, 2) enhanced mobility management. Simultaneously, we present the\nsimulations to show the FEL's efficiency on serving for the mobile users'\ndelay-sensitive content retrieval and distribution in 5G.Comment: Submitted to IEEE Communications Magzine, under review, Feb. 09, 201",

        "title": "A review of architectures and concepts for intelligence in future electric energy system",
        "abstract": "Renewable energy sources are one key enabler to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and to cope with the anthropogenic climate change. Their intermittent behavior and limited storage capabilities present a new challenge to power system operators to maintain power quality and reliability. Additional technical complexity arises from the large number of small distributed generation units and their allocation within the power system. Market liberalization and changing regulatory framework lead to additional organizational complexity. As a result, the design and operation of the future electric energy system have to be redefined. Sophisticated information and communication architectures, automation concepts, and control approaches are necessary in order to manage the higher complexity of so-called smart grids. This paper provides an overview of the state of the art and recent developments enabling higher intelligence in future smart grids. The integration of renewable sources and storage systems into the power grids is analyzed. Energy management and demand response methods and important automation paradigms and domain standards are also reviewed.info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio",

        "abstract": "The operation of the power grid is becoming more stressed, due to the\naddition of new large loads represented by Electric Vehicles (EVs) and a more\nintermittent supply due to the incorporation of renewable sources. As a\nconsequence, the coordination and control of projected EV demand in a network\nof fast charging stations becomes a critical and challenging problem.\n  In this paper, we introduce a game theoretic based decentralized control\nmechanism to alleviate negative impacts from the EV demand. The proposed\nmechanism takes into consideration the non-uniform spatial distribution of EVs\nthat induces uneven power demand at each charging facility, and aims to: (i)\navoid straining grid resources by offering price incentives so that customers\naccept being routed to less busy stations, (ii) maximize total revenue by\nserving more customers with the same amount of grid resources, and (iii)\nprovide charging service to customers with a certain level of\nQuality-of-Service (QoS), the latter defined as the long term customer blocking\nprobability. We examine three scenarios of increased complexity that gradually\napproximate real world settings. The obtained results show that the proposed\nframework leads to substantial performance improvements in terms of the\naforementioned goals, when compared to current state of affairs.Comment: Accepted for Publication in IEEE Transactions on Smart Gri",

        "title": "Decentralized Convergence to Nash Equilibria in Constrained\n  Deterministic Mean Field Control",
        "abstract": "This paper considers decentralized control and optimization methodologies for\nlarge populations of systems, consisting of several agents with different\nindividual behaviors, constraints and interests, and affected by the aggregate\nbehavior of the overall population. For such large-scale systems, the theory of\naggregative and mean field games has been established and successfully applied\nin various scientific disciplines. While the existing literature addresses the\ncase of unconstrained agents, we formulate deterministic mean field control\nproblems in the presence of heterogeneous convex constraints for the individual\nagents, for instance arising from agents with linear dynamics subject to convex\nstate and control constraints. We propose several model-free feedback\niterations to compute in a decentralized fashion a mean field Nash equilibrium\nin the limit of infinite population size. We apply our methods to the\nconstrained linear quadratic deterministic mean field control problem and to\nthe constrained mean field charging control problem for large populations of\nplug-in electric vehicles.Comment: IEEE Trans. on Automatic Control (cond. accepted",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this Ph.D. thesis is to portray deep learning applications for the Predictive Maintenance of Solar Photovoltaic Systems to identify Infrared Thermographic anomalies.\r\n\r\nThe research work carried out initiated the conceptualization, design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel Intelligent Fault Detection and Diagnosis (IFDD) System, alternatively realized as an Intelligent Remote Inspection (IRI) System for large-scale (and utility-scale) Solar Photovoltaic (SPV) Arrays having large surface areas, by deploying drone-aided Infrared Thermographic Imaging and process acquired thermal data by employing artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to precisely locate and capture SPV panels\u2019 thermal degradation pattern for operational decision-making, diagnostic monitoring and prompt maintenance.\r\n\r\nSPV cells are fragile, and temperature is a critical environmental factor for their cascaded and cyclical thermal stresses and irreparable degradation, which are further accelerated by periodical and prolonged heatwave spells and global warming effects. The emergence of AI techniques, particularly deep learning (DL) algorithms leverage the realm of diagnostic monitoring and predictive maintenance (PdM).  The thesis focuses on creating accessible, explainable end-to-end pipelines employing the DL framework, and drawing and preparing datasets from public repositories.\r\n\r\nBesides, acquiring, preparing, and labeling a quality, calibrated, and noise-free SPV panel\u2019s thermal dataset (floating-point temperature intensity values in degrees Celsius) is a challenging task, as SPV energy-producing assets are expected to operate under healthy conditions and achieving targeted output continuously, resulting in fewer faulty labeled instances, whereas a large amount of data is required to train DL models for multiclass classification (or thermal diagnosis).\r\n\r\nThe thesis work is organized into five chapters: Chapter 1 introduces the objective of Predictive Maintenance (PdM), including Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD), Solar Photovoltaic (SPV) energy market, global warming effect, and contribution. Chapter 2 provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in Solar Photovoltaic (SPV) diagnostics, including their application and implementation challenges encountered while selecting and deploying AI algorithms, various Deep Learning (DL) models employed for diagnosis, explainability methods, and Infrared Radiated Thermographic (IRT) inspection for SPV power systems. Chapter 3 describes a theoretical framework for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) comprising its architecture, layers, and training process. Chapter 4 describes the contributions proposed in Monitoring Diagnosis for Predictive Maintenance of Solar Photovoltaic Infrared Thermography. Lastly, Chapter 5 summarizes the work accomplished in this thesis and offers insights and considerations towards future works",

        "title": "Optimization and management of microgrids in the built environment based on intelligent digital twins",
        "abstract": "The interplay between the built environment and energy use has profound implications for global energy consumption, emissions, and the transition towards sustainable systems. Recent analyses reveal that buildings are responsible for consuming approximately 40% of global energy, contributing to over 70% of electricity consumption and nearly a third of all carbon emissions. \r\nAs the energy paradigm shifts, so does the dynamic between infrastructure and energy sources. Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), including microgrids, nanogrids, and behind-the-meter energy storage, offer both challenges and opportunities. Additionally, innovations such as grid-interactive efficient buildings and Electric Vehicle (EV) integration pathways (like EV-to-grid and EV-to-home) are broadening the horizons of demand response, heralding an age marked by heightened demand flexibility.\r\nThe past decade's advancements on the Internet of Things (IoT) have opened an era of interconnected sensors and devices. This transition from limited to expansive data repositories facilitates advanced anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, and smart features based on Machine Learning (ML) and other Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered methods. In this scenario, the emergence of the Digital Twin paradigm (DT) is redefining how we model the contexts in which these innovations operate, even though this concept remains under-explored in the energy and smart grid sectors.\r\n\r\nThis research was conducted with the cooperation of ENEA (Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development) and delves into the challenges and potential of integrating AI with Digital Twins to support and enhance energy management and optimization in built environments. Using a testbed at the Faculty of Architecture of Sapienza University of Rome known as the SmartLAB\u2014a building provided with an IoT network, a photovoltaic system, and an EV charging station\u2014the microgrid is monitored and regulated via an AI-driven energy management system (EMS). Through the deployment of IoT devices, vast data streams are generated enabling insights for an Intelligent Digital Twin (IDT) framework built on open-source methods, integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM), IoT, and AI within a Proof of Concept (PoC) Data Ecosystem. The research's core aims are to craft an autonomous system capable of discerning energy loads using Nai\u0308ve Bayes Classifier with Association Rule Mining ensuring efficient energy consumption management and optimized distribution among distinct loads/users. Moreover, it seeks to enhance the well-being of SmartLAB occupants by overseeing CO2 levels, lowering volatile organic compound (VOC) concentrations through IoT-guided, data-informed procedures. This approach demonstrates adaptability across multiple contexts, from grid interactions to smart ecosystems, improving real-time control and providing data-driven energy optimization strategies.\r\nMoreover, the proposed prototype embraces scalable and cross-disciplinary strategies, paving the way for further integrations, such as space management systems and predictive maintenance. The findings highlight the advantages of embracing DT technologies within the built sector, while ongoing advancements are also discussed towards DT-based Smart Cities and Energy Communities for a more sustainable built environment",

        "abstract": "The built environment is responsible for roughly 40% of global greenhouse emissions, making the sector a crucial factor for climate change and sustainability. Meanwhile, other sectors (like manufacturing) adopted Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve complex, non-linear problems to reduce waste, inefficiency, and pollution. Therefore, many research efforts in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction community have recently tried introducing AI into building asset management (AM) processes. Since AM encompasses a broad set of disciplines, an overview of several AI applications, current research gaps, and trends is needed. In this context, this study conducted the first state-of-the-art research on AI for building asset management. A total of 578 papers were analyzed with bibliometric tools to identify prominent institutions, topics, and journals. The quantitative analysis helped determine the most researched areas of AM and which AI techniques are applied. The areas were furtherly investigated by reading in-depth the 83 most relevant studies selected by screening the articles\u2019 abstracts identified in the bibliometric analysis. The results reveal many applications for Energy Management, Condition assessment, Risk management, and Project management areas. Finally, the literature review identified three main trends that can be a reference point for future studies made by practitioners or researchers: Digital Twin, Generative Adversarial Networks (with synthetic images) for data augmentation, and Deep Reinforcement Learning",

        "title": "Data Science with Foundation Models : An Evidence-Based, Comprehensive Project Methodology",
        "abstract": "In the past decades, the interest in data science has surged across sectors and industries. Data science has been impacted by a series of paradigm shifts, such as the emergence of big data, cloud computing or the demand for developing and operating machine learning-based applications. Project methodologies have continually strived to catch-up, but with limited success, since 80% of data science projects never reach deployment. While initially data science projects ended once a useful model was obtained from carefully engineered data, nowadays models are integrated into software applications which afterwards must be maintained, improved, and adapted. This requires a careful management of all kinds of digital project artifacts.\r\n\r\nThe latest paradigm shift in machine learning, which has not yet been reflected in any project methodology so far, is due to foundation models, which have established themselves as a de facto standard across various media including text, images, video, and audio. Among them large language models play a central role, as they allow reuse for other tasks, without additional training, by prompting them with natural language. Besides, a foundation model can be fine-tuned to new tasks and domains with limited data, while building a foundation model from scratch requires enormous amounts of big data and careful provisions for alignment. Consequently, the nature of data science projects has changed.\r\n\r\nThis thesis proposes the first methodology specifically crafted for modern data science projects, placing foundation models at its core. It seamlessly integrates application development phases into the project lifecycle, adopts an encompassing view of project management, and places a particular emphasis on artifact management for cross-project business purposes. A guiding principle of our methodology is the persistent engagement of domain experts and users throughout the project lifecycle. Recognizing the limited availability of these stakeholders, we propose specific tools to enhance their efficiency, particularly in labor-intensive project activities such as data annotation, modeling, and evaluation.\r\n\r\nThe methodology fully covers a hierarchical catalog of requirements, which comprises 163 groups of project characteristics. The catalog is comprehensive and evidence-based, derived from two exhaustive literature studies. The first study provides a broad and general overview of data science projects, while the second examines the state-of-the-art literature on foundation models. The catalog is validated theoretically by matching it to 8 meta studies on data science methodologies, and practically by case studies from 26 natural language understanding projects.\r\n\r\nThe catalog provides a framework for assessing data science methodologies. 27 such methodologies are compared, and a gap analysis confirms weaknesses in each methodology. The most prominent gaps are the insufficient support for application development and cross-project artifact management, making them inadequate for modern foundation model projects. All the identified gaps are covered by our proposed methodology, proving it to be both comprehensive, dedicated to projects with foundation models and fostering cross-project reuse.\r\n\r\nThe ecosystem and frameworks around foundation models are evolving rapidly and we expect them soon to offer tools that can facilitate project management processes in our methodology",

        "title": "Reset-free Trial-and-Error Learning for Robot Damage Recovery",
        "abstract": "The high probability of hardware failures prevents many advanced robots\n(e.g., legged robots) from being confidently deployed in real-world situations\n(e.g., post-disaster rescue). Instead of attempting to diagnose the failures,\nrobots could adapt by trial-and-error in order to be able to complete their\ntasks. In this situation, damage recovery can be seen as a Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) problem. However, the best RL algorithms for robotics require the\nrobot and the environment to be reset to an initial state after each episode,\nthat is, the robot is not learning autonomously. In addition, most of the RL\nmethods for robotics do not scale well with complex robots (e.g., walking\nrobots) and either cannot be used at all or take too long to converge to a\nsolution (e.g., hours of learning). In this paper, we introduce a novel\nlearning algorithm called \"Reset-free Trial-and-Error\" (RTE) that (1) breaks\nthe complexity by pre-generating hundreds of possible behaviors with a dynamics\nsimulator of the intact robot, and (2) allows complex robots to quickly recover\nfrom damage while completing their tasks and taking the environment into\naccount. We evaluate our algorithm on a simulated wheeled robot, a simulated\nsix-legged robot, and a real six-legged walking robot that are damaged in\nseveral ways (e.g., a missing leg, a shortened leg, faulty motor, etc.) and\nwhose objective is to reach a sequence of targets in an arena. Our experiments\nshow that the robots can recover most of their locomotion abilities in an\nenvironment with obstacles, and without any human intervention.Comment: 18 pages, 16 figures, 3 tables, 6 pseudocodes/algorithms, video at\n  https://youtu.be/IqtyHFrb3BU, code at\n  https://github.com/resibots/chatzilygeroudis_2018_rt",

        "abstract": "Background: E-mental health is a promising medium to keep mental health affordable and accessible. For consumers with severe mental illness the evidence of the effectiveness of e-health is limited. A number of difficulties and barriers have to be addressed concerning e-health for consumers with severe mental illness. One possible solution might be to blend e-health with face-to-face delivery of a recovery-oriented treatment, like the Illness Management & Recovery (IMR) programme. This paper describes the development of an e-health application for the IMR programme and the design of an early clustered randomized controlled trial. \nMethod/Design: We developed the e-IMR intervention according to the six-step protocol of Intervention Mapping. Consumers joined the development group to address important and relevant issues for the target group. Decisions during the six-step development process were based on qualitative evaluations of the Illness Management & Recovery programme, structured interviews, discussion in the development group, and literature reviews on qualitative papers concerning consumers with severe mental illness, theoretical models, behavioural change techniques, and telemedicine for consumers with severe mental illness. The aim of the e-IMR intervention is to help consumers with severe mental illness to involve others, manage achieving goals, and prevent relapse. The e-IMR intervention consists of face-to-face delivery of the Illness Management & Recovery programme and an e-health application containing peer-testimonials on videos, follow up on goals and coping strategies, monitoring symptoms, solving problems, and communication opportunities. We designed an early cluster randomized controlled trial that will evaluate the e-IMR intervention. In the control condition the Illness Management & Recovery programme is provided. The main effect-study parameters are: illness management, recovery, psychiatric symptoms severity, self-management, quality of life, and general health. The process of the IMR program will be evaluated on fidelity and feasibility in semi-structured interviews with participants and trainers. \nDiscussion: Intervention Mapping provided a systematic procedure for the development of this e-health intervention for consumers with severe mental illness and the preparation of an early randomized controlled trial",

The study scope is defined to be from the front-end areas at the antennas to the end users (spacecraft teams, principal investigators, archival storage systems, and non-NASA partners). The architectural vision provides guidance for major DSN implementation efforts during the next decade. A strong motivation for the study is an expected dramatic improvement in information-systems technologies, such as the following: computer processing, automation technology (including knowledge-based systems), networking and data transport, software and hardware engineering, and human-interface technology. The proposed Ground Information System has the following major features: unified architecture from the front-end area to the end user; open-systems standards to achieve interoperability; DSN production of level 0 data; delivery of level 0 data from the Deep Space Communications Complex, if desired; dedicated telemetry processors for each receiver; security against unauthorized access and errors; and highly automated monitor and control",

        "abstract": "In complex industrial and chemical process control rooms, effective decision-making is crucial for safety and efficiency. The experiments in this paper evaluate the impact and applications of an AI-based decision support system integrated into an improved human-machine interface, using dynamic influence diagrams, a hidden Markov model, and deep reinforcement learning. The enhanced support system aims to reduce operator workload, improve situational awareness, and provide different intervention strategies to the operator adapted to the current state of both the system and human performance. Such a system can be particularly useful in cases of information overload when many alarms and inputs are presented all within the same time window, or for junior operators during training. A comprehensive cross-data analysis was conducted, involving 47 participants and a diverse range of data sources such as smartwatch metrics, eye-tracking data, process logs, and responses from questionnaires. The results indicate interesting insights regarding the effectiveness of the approach in aiding decision-making, decreasing perceived workload, and increasing situational awareness for the scenarios considered. Additionally, the results provide insights to compare differences between styles of information gathering when using the system by individual participants. These findings are particularly relevant when predicting the overall performance of the individual participant and their capacity to successfully handle a plant upset and the alarms connected to it using process and human-machine interaction logs in real-time which resulted in a 95.8% prediction accuracy using hidden Markov model. These predictions enable the development of more effective intervention strategies",

        "abstract": "This paper examines how childhood trauma experienced by Indigenous children can be overcome by appropriate interventions.IntroductionWhile many Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian children grow up in safe homes and live in safe communities, there are some who do not. In the case of Indigenous children, some families and communities are unable to, or are still working to, heal the trauma of past events, including displacement from Country, institutionalisation and abuse. The Stolen Generations also represent a significant cause of trauma. In 2008, an estimated 8% of Indigenous people aged 15 and over reported being removed from their natural family and 38% had relatives who had been removed from their natural family. This trauma can pass to children (inter-generational trauma).Indigenous children may also experience a range of distressing life events including illness and accidents, hospitalisation or death of close family members, exposure to violence, family disintegration (with kin networks fragmented due to forced removals, relationship breakdown and possibly incarceration) and financial stress.Experiencing trauma in childhood can have severe and long-lasting effects; effects that can be overcome by appropriate interventions. This resource sheet examines these effects and explores how they can be tackled. It focuses on the design and delivery of trauma-informed and trauma-specific children\u2019s services and care",

        "title": "Synthesizing FDIR Recovery Strategies for Space Systems",
        "abstract": "Dynamic Fault Trees (DFTs) are powerful tools to drive the design of fault tolerant systems. However, semantic pitfalls limit their practical utility for interconnected systems that require complex recovery strategies to maximize their reliability. This thesis discusses the shortcomings of DFTs in the context of analyzing Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) concepts with a particular focus on the needs of space systems. To tackle these shortcomings, we introduce an inherently non-deterministic model for DFTs. Deterministic recovery strategies are synthesized by transforming these non-deterministic DFTs into Markov automata that represent all possible choices between recovery actions. From the corresponding scheduler, optimized to maximize a given RAMS (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Safety) metric, an optimal recovery strategy can then be derived and represented by a model we call recovery automaton. We discuss dedicated techniques for reducing the state space of this recovery automaton and analyze their soundness and completeness. Moreover, modularized approaches to handle the complexity added by the state-based transformation approach are discussed. Furthermore, we consider the non-deterministic approach in a partially observable setting and propose an approach to lift the model for the fully observable case. We give an implementation of our approach within the Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) framework Virtual Satellite. Finally, the implementation is evaluated based on the FFORT benchmark. The results show that basic non-deterministic DFTs generally scale well. However, we also found that semantically enriched non-deterministic DFTs employing repair or delayed observability mechanisms pose a challenge",

        "title": "Human Connection as a Treatment for Addiction",
        "abstract": "Research supports that social connection is important in both humans and animals. In humans, having a cohesive support/social network system and healthy attachments in childhood predict low risk of later addiction (i.e. substance use disorder), as does perceived support from a religious or other cohesive community. Moreover, personal characteristics such as identifying as religious or spiritual can predict low risk for addiction, but little is known about the intersection of neuroscience and religion/spirituality in this regard. Conversely, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have repeatedly been shown to predict later addiction. However, the role of the body\u2019s neuro-hormonal responses, such as the endogenous opioid and oxytocin systems in this process merits further exploration, such as how the production or deprivation of endogenous opioids impact later substance use patterns. Existing research also provides evidence that individuals decrease pursuit of interpersonal connections and social bonds when they use substances that activate opioid receptors. This has been found with both substances of abuse and medications used to treat addiction (e.g., methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone). Research has also demonstrated that addiction often results in situations of social isolation. However, it remains to be elucidated whether the substances of abuse physiologically meet that need for connection. Importantly, research across numerous fields indicates that intentionally increasing interpersonal connection may be an effective treatment for addiction. However, less is known about how specific characteristics of communities impact the quantity, quality, or effectiveness of care and support for a person with addiction [...]https://dc.etsu.edu/etsu_books/1292/thumbnail.jp",

        "abstract": "Engineering of knowledge-intensive processes (KiPs) is far from being mastered, since they are genuinely knowledge- and data-centric, and require substantial flexibility, at both design- and run-time. In this work, starting from a scientific literature analysis in the area of KiPs and from three real-world domains and application scenarios, we provide a precise characterization of KiPs. Furthermore, we devise some general requirements related to KiPs management and execution. Such requirements contribute to the definition of an evaluation framework to assess current system support for KiPs. To this end, we present a critical analysis on a number of existing process-oriented approaches by discussing their efficacy against the requirements",
