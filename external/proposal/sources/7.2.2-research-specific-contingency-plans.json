      "Modeling Human DER Worker Capabilities for HDT Creation** *(Relates to: HEW node: \"Human DER Worker (Tools/Resources/Prompts)\" and its link to the DTW node)*",
      "** What are the essential components of a Human DER Worker's operational expertise—including their use of tools (e.g., SCADA interfaces as noted by Starke et al., 2022), knowledge resources (e.g., technical manuals, historical data per Ma et al., 2024), and communication patterns/prompts (e.g., SOPs, informal exchanges as studied by Carvalho et al., 2007)—that can be effectively identified, structured, and represented within an HDT framework using agent protocol primitives (e.g., MCP Tools/Resources/Prompts, A2A Skills/Artifacts as defined by Ehtesham et al., 2025)?    **SRQ1.2:** How can the tacit knowledge and adaptive decision-making strategies of experienced Human DER Workers, particularly in response to unforeseen operational events or \"micro-incidents\" (Carvalho et al., 2007), be elicited and formalized into computational models suitable for instantiation within an HDT's \"Tool Access/Knowledge/Comms\" layers?",
      "Designing Protocol-Enabled HDT Architectures for DER Contexts** *(Relates to: DTW node: \"Digital Twin Worker (Tool Access/Knowledge/Comms)\" and its interaction with the Application Context (AC) and Evaluation Context (EC))*",
      "** How can different agent protocol architectures (e.g., MCP for centralized orchestration, A2A for peer collaboration, ANP for decentralized discovery, as surveyed by Ehtesham et al., 2025) be effectively mapped and implemented to model various Human DER Worker coordination models (e.g., single expert, expert network) within specific DER Application Contexts such as predictive maintenance and operations (DER PM & Ops)?    **SRQ2.2:** What architectural adaptations are necessary for agent protocols (MCP, A2A, ANP) to enable the HDT to not only represent human worker capabilities (Tool Access, Knowledge, Comms) but also to dynamically interact with and learn from the Application Context (AC) and the Evaluation Context (EC), ensuring the HDT remains adaptive and its representations current?",
      "Evaluating the Effectiveness of Human-HDT Collaboration in DER Operations** *(Relates to: Interaction between HEW and DTW, and the role of the EC node: \"Evaluation Context (Framework Implementation)\")*",
      "** What multi-faceted evaluation framework, incorporating metrics for technical efficacy (e.g., improved PMx accuracy, operational efficiency as per Abd Wahab et al., 2024), fidelity of human expertise representation (Ma et al., 2024 on DT functional requirements), and human factors (e.g., operator trust, workload reduction, enhanced situational awareness as per Chen et al., 2017), is required to assess the impact of HDT integration on DER PM & Ops?    **SRQ3.2:** How does the feedback loop from the \"Evaluation Context\" (EC), where the HDT's performance is assessed, contribute to refining the HDT's representation of the Human DER Worker (HEW) and improving its utility in the Application Context (AC)? (Reflected in the \"Evaluation Framework Refines Representation\" arrow)."
    ],
    "hypotheses": [
      "Agent protocols can effectively model core components of Human DER Worker expertise for HDT creation.** *(Corresponds to SRQ1: Modeling Human DER Worker Capabilities)*",
      "** The structural primitives of agent communication protocols (e.g., MCP Tools/Resources/Prompts, A2A Skills/Artifacts as per Ehtesham et al., 2025) are sufficiently expressive to formally represent the key operational tools, knowledge resources, and standardized communication patterns utilized by Human DER Workers in their daily tasks (as identified by Starke et al., 2022; Carvalho et al., 2007).    **H1.2:** Computational models, derived from methods like cognitive task analysis and expert interviews, can capture and translate a significant portion of Human DER Workers' tacit knowledge and adaptive decision-making strategies into explicit rules and procedures implementable within an HDT's layered architecture (Tool Access/Knowledge/Comms), making this expertise digitally accessible and scalable.",
      "Protocol-enabled HDT architectures can be designed to effectively function within diverse DER application contexts.** *(Corresponds to SRQ2: Designing Protocol-Enabled HDT Architectures)*",
      "** Specific configurations of agent protocol architectures (MCP, A2A, ANP) can be tailored to accurately represent and support different Human DER Worker coordination models (e.g., centralized expert control, distributed peer collaboration) required for effective DER PM & Ops, enhancing existing agent-based DER management concepts (e.g., Starke et al., 2022; Veith, 2017).    **H2.2:** HDTs designed with adaptive agent protocols can dynamically interact with the DER Application Context (AC) and Evaluation Context (EC), allowing them to update their internal models and maintain the relevance of the represented human expertise over time, thus addressing a key challenge in DTs (Ma et al., 2024).",
      "The integration of HDTs into DER operations, guided by a comprehensive evaluation framework, will lead to demonstrable improvements in operational effectiveness and human-agent collaboration.** *(Corresponds to SRQ3: Evaluating Human-HDT Collaboration)*",
      "** A multi-faceted evaluation framework will demonstrate that HDT-augmented DER operations result in quantifiable improvements in technical efficacy (e.g., increased PMx accuracy, reduced system downtime) and positive human factors outcomes (e.g., increased operator trust, reduced cognitive load, improved situational awareness as per Chen et al., 2017) compared to baseline operations.    **H3.2:** The iterative refinement of HDTs, based on feedback from the Evaluation Context (EC), will lead to a progressively more accurate and useful digital representation of the Human DER Worker (HEW), enhancing the synergy between human expertise and automated systems (as implied by the feedback arrow from DT to HEW via Evaluation in the visual model)."
