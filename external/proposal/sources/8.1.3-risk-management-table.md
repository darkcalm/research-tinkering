| Technical | Bi-weekly | Literature alerts, protocol updates | Major protocol changes affecting scope |
| Methodological | Bi-weekly | Progress review, methodology validation | Difficulty synthesizing findings |
| Resource | Weekly | Progress tracking, resource assessment | Two consecutive weeks behind schedule |
| Impact | Monthly | Stakeholder feedback, impact assessment | Significant negative feedback |
| Timeline | Weekly | Milestone tracking, deliverable status | Missing critical milestones |

## Risk Response Strategies

### Prevention Strategies
| Risk Type | Prevention Approach | Implementation |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Timeline | Early planning, buffer time | Built into project schedule |
| Resource | Stakeholder engagement, alternatives | Ongoing relationship management |
| Technical | Continuous monitoring, modular design | Weekly protocol updates review |
| Methodological | Framework validation, peer review | Regular supervisor consultations |

### Contingency Plans
| Risk Scenario | Primary Response | Secondary Response | Decision Point |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Major timeline delay | Reduce scope, parallel activities | Extend timeline, simplify prototype | Week 8 review |
| Technical barriers | Alternative protocols, simplified integration | Focus on theoretical framework | Mid-Phase 2 |
| Resource constraints | Open-source alternatives, cloud resources | Academic partnerships, simplified scope | Ongoing |
| Data access issues | Synthetic data, simulation | Public datasets, literature-based | Phase 1 completion |
