AI-generated Abstract
The advancement and penetration of distributed energy resources
(DERs) and renewable energy sources (RES) are transforming legacy
energy systems in an attempt to reduce carbon emissions and
energy waste. Demand Response (DR) has been identified as a key
enabler of integrating these, and other, Smart Grid technologies,
while, simultaneously, ensuring grid stability and secure energy
supply. The massive deployment of smart meters, Io T devices and
DERs dictate the need to move to decentralized, or even localized,
DR schemes in the face of the increased scale and complexity of
monitoring and coordinating the actors and devices in modern
smart grids. Furthermore, there is an inherent need to guarantee
interoperability, due to the vast number of, e.g., hardware and
software stakeholders, and, more importantly, promote trust and
incentivize the participation of customers in DR schemes, if they are
to be successfully deployed.

A Secured and Trusted Demand Response system based on
Blockchain technologies
Konstantinos Votis
2018 Innovations in Intelligent Systems and Applications (INISTA)
The aim of the proposed work is to introduce a secure and
interoperable Demand Response (DR) management platform that
will assist Aggregators (or other relevant Stakeholders involved in
DR business scenarios) in their decision making mechanisms over
their portfolios of prosumers. This novel architecture incorporates
multiple strategies and policies provided from energy market
stakeholders, establishing a more modular and future-proof DR
solution. By employing an innovative multi-agent decision making
system and self-learning algorithms to enable aggregation,
segmentation and coordination of several diverse clusters,
consisting of supply and demand assets, a fully autonomous design
will be delivered. This DR framework is further fortified in terms of
data security by not only implementing cutting-edge blockchain
infrastructure, but also by making use of Smart Contracts and
Decentralized Applications (d Apps) which will further secure and
facilitate Aggregators-to-Prosumers transactions. The blockchain
technologies will be combined with well-known open protocols (i.e.
Open ADR) towards also supporting interoperability in terms of
information exchange.

Blockchain Technology Applied to Energy Demand Response
Service Tracking and Data Sharing
Alexandre Lucas
Energies, 2021
Demand response (DR) services have the potential to enable large
penetration of renewable energy by adjusting load consumption,
thus providing balancing support to the grid. The success of such
load flexibility provided by industry, communities, or prosumers
and its integration in electricity markets, will depend on a redesign
and adaptation of the current interactions between participants.
New challenges are, however, bound to appear with the large scale

the dispatch coordination, the validation of delivery of the DR
provision, and the corresponding settlement of contracts, while
assuring secured data access among interested parties. In this study
we applied distributed ledger (DLT)/blockchain technology to
securely track DR provision, focusing on the validation aspect,
assuring data integrity, origin, fast registry, and sharing within a

Blockchain as Key Enabling Technology for Future Electric Energy
Exchange: A Vision
Alvise Baggio
IEEE Access
Our energy scenario is nowadays shaped by progressive
electrification of energy final use. In this context, electricity
networks are seeing a growing multitude of distributed assets
entering from the edges of the grid and acquiring new ICT
capabilities that were limited before to a restricted number of major
players. Particularly, assets like Photovoltaic Inverter (Pv I), Electric
Vehicle (EV) chargers, wind turbines controllers, programmable
loads, storage systems, and other Distributed Energy Resources
(DER) are now able to communicate through different technologies
and make conscious choices under humandecisions or even
independently. This is leading to a decentralization of the system's
view by increasing single actor independence. Notwithstanding, a
problem arises when current centrally-managed electricity networks
struggle to coordinate massive amounts of new figures and adapt to
this new decentralized paradigm. Therefore, a decentralized
coordination-and-control framework will ensure better integration
of DERs and new figures as prosumers, while allowing higher
exploitation of their potential compared to centrally managed
systems. This article seeks in Blockchains the enabling technology
for designing and supporting such a grid infrastructure. It develops
a first framework to address this need by envisioning a gridsystem
based on the direct participation of nowadays-used embeddedenergy-devices within a decentralized platform hosting specific

coordination procedures. The platform was developed in an
experimental research campaign performed at ABB Laboratories
basing on embedded-devices currently designed as
controlconnectivity boards for smart-inverters. Therefore this article
introduces the background theory and reasons behind this proposed
system. The intent here is not to give all the specific details of the
implementation, but introduce the supporting reason, high-level
design, and required characteristic of the Blockchain-based platform
for coordinating grid operations. Blockchain technology is seen here
as the appropriate technology to enable the realization of a multiactor energy-management system and enable distributed
coordination in power grids. INDEX TERMS Blockchain, distributed

Privacy-Preserving Smart Grid Tariff Decisions with BlockchainBased Smart Contracts
Günther Eibl
Sustainable Cloud and Energy Services, 2017
The smart grid changes the way how energy and information are
exchanged and offers opportunities for incentive-based load
balancing. For instance, customers may shift the time of energy
consumption of household appliances in exchange for a cheaper
energy tariff. This paves the path towards a full range of modular
tariffs and dynamic pricing that incorporate the overall grid
capacity as well as individual customer demands. This also allows
customers to frequently switch within a variety of tariffs from
different utility providers based on individual energy consumption
and provision forecasts. For automated tariff decisions it is desirable
to have a tool that assists in choosing the optimum tariff based on a
prediction of individual energy need and production. However, the
revelation of individual load patterns for smart grid applications
poses severe privacy threats for customers as analyzed in depth in
literature. Similarly, accurate and fine-grained regional load
forecasts are sensitive business information of utility providers that
are not supposed to be released publicly. This paper extends
previous work in the domain of privacy-preserving load profile

### Page 11

matching where load profiles from utility providers and load profile
forecasts from customers are transformed in a distance-preserving
embedding in order to find a matching tariff. The embeddings
neither reveal individual contributions of customers, nor those of
utility providers. Prior work requires a dedicated entity that needs
to be trustworthy at least to some extent for determining the
matches. In this paper we propose an adaption of this protocol,
where we use blockchains and smart contracts for this matching
process, instead. Blockchains are gaining widespread adaption in
the smart grid domain as a powerful tool for public commitments
and accountable calculations. While the use of a decentralized and
trust-free blockchain for this protocol comes at the price of some
privacy degradation (for which a mitigation is outlined), this
drawback is outweighed for it enables verifiability, reliability and
transparency.

Blockchain Based Decentralized Management of Demand Response
Programs in Smart Energy Grids
Massimo Bertoncini
Sensors (Basel, Switzerland), 2018
In this paper, we investigate the use of decentralized blockchain
mechanisms for delivering transparent, secure, reliable, and timely
energy flexibility, under the form of adaptation of energy demand
profiles of Distributed Energy Prosumers, to all the stakeholders
involved in the flexibility markets (Distribution System Operators
primarily, retailers, aggregators, etc.). In our approach, a
blockchain based distributed ledger stores in a tamper proof manner
the energy prosumption information collected from Internet of
Things smart metering devices, while self-enforcing smart contracts
programmatically define the expected energy flexibility at the level
of each prosumer, the associated rewards or penalties, and the rules
for balancing the energy demand with the energy production at grid
level. Consensus based validation will be used for demand response
programs validation and to activate the appropriate financial
settlement for the flexibility providers. The approach was validated

Privacy and Transparency in Blockchain-Based Smart Grid
Operations
Pierluigi Gallo
IEEE Access
In the past few years, blockchain technology has emerged in
numerous smart grid applications, enabling the construction of
systems without the need for a trusted third party. Blockchain offers
transparency, traceability, and accountability, which lets various
energy management system functionalities be executed through
smart contracts, such as monitoring, consumption analysis, and
intelligent energy adaptation. Nevertheless, revealing sensitive
energy consumption information could render users vulnerable to
digital and physical assaults. This paper presents a novel method for
achieving a dual balance between privacy and transparency, as well
as accountability and verifiability. This equilibrium requires the
incorporation of cryptographic tools like Secure Multiparty
Computation and Verifiable Secret Sharing within the distributed
components of a multi-channel blockchain and its associated smart
contracts. We corroborate the suggested architecture throughout the
entire process of a Demand Response scenario, from the collection
of energy data to the ultimate reward. To address our proposal's
constraints, we present countermeasures against accidental crashes
and Byzantine behavior while ensuring that the solution remains
appropriate for low-performance Io T devices.

Blockchain for Smart Grid Flexibility Handling Settlements between
the Aggregator and Prosumers
Marius Rohde Johannessen
2021
This paper shows how the Ethereum blockchain can register
settlements between an aggregator and prosumers in a smart grid.
By providing flexible use of electricity to the aggregator, customers
get rewarded. The flexibility is valuable for the aggregator since the
power infrastructure may be used more efficiently. Blockchain is an

exciting technology for handling settlements which, however, also
has some clear limitations. For example, the cost per transaction on
the public Ethereum blockchain is too high compared to the value
of the actual transactions. A private blockchain is an alternative but
removes some of the original benefits of using the public
blockchain. The paper concludes that blockchain is a promising
technology, and a private blockchain is more suitable for
transactions containing minimal amounts. Keywords-smart grid;

INTEGRATION OF THE BLOCKCHAIN IN A SMART GRID MODEL
Guillaume Guérard
Nowadays, one of the principal concerns of the scientific
community is the energy transition and energy efficiency. Indeed,
the expansion of objects consuming and Io T leds to a significant
increase in energy demand. To find a solution to this phenomenon
is essential. Currently, one of the solutions that can be applied is the
Smart Grid. It would optimize the energy consumption by setting
consumption patterns, adapted to a specific situation, taking into
account different parameters like the pricer, the user preferences, or
the parameters of the appliances of the house. Promoting renewable
energies such as solar or wind power, are also part of the issues of
the Smart Grid. The goal is to promote local energy production, and
then avoid the energy transport loses over long distances. However,
the produced energy by renewable energies is erratic, thus a
numerical management is needed. A blockchain is a distributed,
decentralized transaction ledger, which is owned, maintained and
updated by each user. It carries peer-to-peer energy exchanges
among citizens of a same microgrid, without a central control body,

based on smart contracts. The smart contracts will have the role to
automatically satisfy some conditions or rules of consumption,
among citizens. These contracts might contain the user preferences
or the consumption patterns of appliances. A city contains several
microgrids, each with their own blockchain, the inhabitants would
have solar panels or other energy sources, and then would feed
those which claim energies by making a transaction following the
smart contracts. This paper focuses on these peer-to-peer
transactions in a microgrid validated by a blockchain.

A blockchain-based infrastructure for reliable and cost-effective Io Taided smart grids
Stefano De Angelis
One of the main trends in the evolution of smart grids is transactive
energy, where distributed energy resources, e.g. smart meters,
develop towards Internet-of-Things (Io T) devices enabling
prosumers to trade energy directly among each other, without the
need of involving any centralised third party. The expected
advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness would be significant,
indeed technical solutions are being investigated and large-scale
deployment are planned by major utilities companies. However,
introducing transactive energy in the smart grid entails new
security threats, such as forging energy transactions.
{\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}This paper introduces an
infrastructure to support reliable and cost-effective transactive
energy, based on blockchain and smart contracts, where
functionalities are implemented as fully decentralised applications.
Energy transactions are stored in the blockchain, whose high
replication level ensures stronger guarantees against tampering.
Energy auctions are carried out according to transparent rules
implemented as smart contracts, hence visible to all involved actors.
Threats deriving from known vulnerabilities of smart meters are
mitigated by temporarily keeping out exposed prosumers and
updating their devices as soon as security patches become available.
