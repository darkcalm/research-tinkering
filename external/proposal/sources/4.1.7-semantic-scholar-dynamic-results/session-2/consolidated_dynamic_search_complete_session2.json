        "abstract": "The electricity grid is one of the most complex systems created by human beings. It consists of an intricate network of components such as generators, transmission and distribution lines, transformers, breakers, various controllers, and various measurement and monitoring systems. The grid has been going through significant changes in past decades with new technological developments, deregulation, distributed generation, smart grid, and asset management. A synergy of these new developments has contributed to a better grid by improving its reliability and performance. However, the efficient coordination between various components of the grid and various new developments has been a constant challenge. For instance, new components that are introduced in the grid often have state of the art measurement and monitoring systems whereas the aging components have limited measurement and monitoring systems. We need to maintain the balance between these new and old technologies such that the new developments should be exploited to their full extent and the old systems should be reinforced such that their operational life could be extended without affecting their reliability significantly. Due to the complexity of the grid control, a centralized control of every component and every aspect of the grid is practically impossible. A distributed control system provides the ability to simplify the complexity of the grid control problem while solving the complex problem of coordination between its sub-systems. A distributed system is modular in nature and this system could be introduced to the grid in incremental phases within large networks. Multi-agent control can be used in the grid to realize a distributed system. Using agent theory, a concept of an intelligent component is described in this thesis. The intelligent component has the ability to make intelligent decisions based on the state of the component. With developments in measurement and monitoring technologies, we are better informed of the state of the grid components. By using these systems, we have the ability to better predict the health state of the grid components. There has also been significant developments in understanding how the health state of the grid components evolves over their lifetime. A model of the health state coupled with the new measurement and monitoring system allows us to predict the health state of the system. A framework of model-based optimization is included in the intelligent component. This framework consists of a predictive health model. An optimization is performed based on the prediction of the health model and the control decision of the intelligent component is made on the basis of this optimization. In order to solve the whole problem of the electricity grid, the intelligent components need to collaborate within each other. A concept of an intelligent network is also proposed in this thesis. In the intelligent network concept, a hierarchical structure of intelligent components has been developed. In order to optimize their global performance, the intelligent components need to collaborate with each other. The intelligent components within this hierarchical structure coordinate by exchanging their local states and their future plans. Coordination within intelligent network is only possible if all their intelligent components can communicate effectively. For this, an information interface was developed. The interface is particularly of importance in the electricity grid as different control systems used within the grid are often developed by different vendors. Common Information Model (CIM) has been deployed in the grid for network control, data exchange, and energy management systems. This CIM is further developed in this thesis so that it can accommodate the concept of the intelligent component and the intelligent network developed in this thesis. A case study of dynamic loading of transformers is used to illustrate the concept. The example is used throughout the thesis to demonstrate applicability of concepts of the intelligent component, the intelligent networks and the information interface. A dynamic loading scheme of transformer is developed based on the concept of intelligent components. A predictive health model for the top-oil temperature and the hot-spot temperature is developed. The predictive heath model predicts the top-oil temperature and the hot-spot temperature based on the loading of the transformer. An optimization method is developed which gives the dynamic rating of the transformer based on these predictions. The dynamic loading (DL) agent, developed here, could make local decisions on its dynamic rating based on the predicted loading of the transformer. This dynamic loading is applied in a electricity grid to illustrate the concept of intelligent networks. Multiple transformers within the grid have their own dynamic loading agents. An optimal power flow (OPF) agent is developed which controls the grid based on an optimal power flow algorithm. The OPF agent obtains the dynamic ratings from the dynamic loading agents of the transformers. Based on these dynamic ratings, the OPF agent controls the power flow of the grid. The OPF agent also sends predicted loadings of the transformers to its DL agents. These predicted loading is used by the dynamic loading agents which use this information for the next time step. The information interface is also described for this intelligent network implementation. In order to communicate dynamic ratings and predicted loadings of transformers, an extension to the CIM is developed. The workflow of the intelligent agent and its interaction with the extended CIM is also demonstrated. It is concluded that the use of the predictive health model enables the optimization for the future prediction horizon. The intelligent component concept is modular in nature which is useful for the electricity grid. The intelligent network concept effectively combines intelligent components within it. The framework developed in this thesis is also demonstrated with examples of dynamic loading of transformers within an electricity network in which the loading of the transformers are increased by 50 % of its nominal rating. Possible future extension of the predictive health model to include other electrical components models such as cables, circuit breakers, and generators, etc. is also discussed. A suggestion on the implementation phases of the concept developed in this thesis is also presented. It is suggested that the concept would be practical to be implemented in gradual phases to the electricity grid. New developments are also a potential opportunity for the implementation of the concept as the marginal cost is minimal for introducing the concept."

        "abstract": "A key challenge in the power and energy field is the development of decision-support systems that enable studying big problems as a whole. The interoperability between systems that address specific parts of the global problem is essential. Ontologies ease the interoperability between heterogeneous systems providing semantic meaning to the information exchanged between the various parties. The use of ontologies within Smart Grids has been proposed based on the Common Information Model, which defines a common vocabulary describing the basic components used in electricity transportation and distribution. However, these ontologies are focused on utilities needs. The development of ontologies that allow the representation of diverse knowledge sources is essential, aiming at supporting the interaction between entities of different natures, facilitating the interoperability between these systems. This paper proposes a set of ontologies to enable the interoperability between different types of simulators, namely regarding electricity markets, the smart grid, and residential energy management. A case study based on real data shows the advantages of the proposed approach in enabling comprehensive power system simulation studies."

Multi-agent systems have shown to be a suitable software development paradigm for cyber-physical systems and may well profit from harnessing ontologies in terms of reduced engineering effort and better interoperability. This contribution presents a development methodology for ontologies that enable communication and reasoning in Multi-Agent Systems for cyber-physical systems. The methodology is unique in addressing a set of requirements specific to this application domain."

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a new reality. The insight derived from data collected from new Internet-connected devices can be used to develop new services, enhance productivity and efficiency, improve real-time decision making, solve critical problems, and create new and innovative experiences. In recent years, IoT related with energy, which is called Energy-IoT, is emerging as a major solution for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, sharply falling costs and growth in use of renewable energy, energy storage, and smart grid technologies. IoT can help an organization reduce energy waste in many ways. Organizations understand the natural synergies between the IoT and energy-related issues. The Energy-IoT based on distributed sensor networks is being employed in many applications, such as smart grid, microgrid, energy management system, and industrial security. However, as more devices connect, this revolutionary Energy-IoT service and applications based on physical and virtual sensor networks are facing converging risks with increased fragmentation, interoperability, privacy, safety, and security challenges. This special issue consists of the topics related to the physical and virtual sensor networks with Energy-IoT infrastructures, services, and applications for original, high-impact research papers and provides insight and future research directions to readers. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018Synchronization Method for LTE-based Machine-Type Communication in Lowpower Cellular IoT\u2019\u2019 by R Pec et al. proposed a synchronization method for long-term evolution (LTE)-based machine-type communication. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018Resource Management Model based on Cloud Computing Environment\u2019\u2019 by A Kim et al. proposed a model of resource management in cloud computing environment. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018A Multihop Angular Routing Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks\u2019\u2019 by M Akbar et al. proposed a protocol of multihop angular routing for wireless sensor networks. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018A Gateway Deployment Heuristic for Enhancing the Availability of Sensor Grids\u2019\u2019 by M Hussain et al. proposed a gateway deployment heuristic that enhances the sensor grids availability. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018Design of a Mass-Customization-based CostEffective Internet of Things Sensor System in Smart Building Spaces\u2019\u2019 by S Park et al. proposed an IoT sensor system in smart building spaces for cost-effectiveness. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018Effective and Reliable Malware Group Classification for a Massive Malware Environment\u2019\u2019 by T Lee et al. proposed an effective and reliable classification of malware group. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018Smart Energy Efficient Device-to-Multi Device Cooperative Clustering for Multicasting Content\u2019\u2019 by M Ashraf et al. proposed a cooperative clustering of device-to-multi device for multicasting content. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018Multi-Agent Semantical Annotation Enhancement Model for IoT based Energy Aware Data\u2019\u2019 by KR Malik et al. proposed a model of multiagent semantical annotation enhancement for IoT. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018Environment Parameters Control based on Wireless Sensor Network in Livestock Buildings\u2019\u2019 by Y Zhang et al. proposed an environment parameter control based on wireless sensor network. We have received a lot of submissions coming from different countries all around the globe in response to call for papers. Each accepted article has been reviewed by at least three reviewers. In the end, several articles based on technical novelty, integrity of the analysis, and social impacts and practical relevance have been revised and selected for publishing in this special issue. We believe that the accepted papers would be a meaningful contribution to researchers, students, and practitioners studying this field of physical and virtual sensor networks for Energy-IoT."

        "abstract": "The accelerating global shift toward renewable energy integration presents both a technical imperative and a systemic challenge to traditional power grid architectures. Variability, decentralization, and real-time balancing requirements have exposed the limitations of conventional control and forecasting strategies. This review critically examines how artificial intelligence (AI) is redefining energy management systems to meet the operational and strategic needs of renewable-integrated smart grids. It explores the state-of-the-art in AI-based load and generation forecasting, real-time grid state estimation, anomaly detection, and predictive maintenance, highlighting how machine learning and deep learning techniques enhance grid observability and fault resilience. Particular attention is given to AI-driven optimization of energy storage dispatch, multi-agent coordination in microgrids, and the deployment of edge intelligence for decentralized control. Furthermore, the review evaluates current barriers\u2014ranging from data sparsity and model interpretability to lack of standardization\u2014and proposes targeted research directions, including explainable AI, quantum-enhanced computing, and AI-powered coordination of distributed storage and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks. The convergence of AI, digital infrastructure, and policy innovation emerges as critical to unlocking the full potential of next-generation grids. This article provides researchers, engineers, and policymakers with a rigorous synthesis of current advancements and a forward-looking agenda for achieving intelligent, resilient, and decarbonized energy systems."

        "abstract": "The agricultural sector is facing mounting demands to enhance energy efficiency within farm enterprises, concurrent with a steady escalation in electricity costs. This paper focuses on modelling the adoption rate of photovoltaic (PV) energy within the dairy sector in Ireland. An agent-based modelling approach is introduced to estimate the adoption rate. The model considers grid energy prices, revenue, costs, and maintenance expenses to calculate the probability of PV adoption. The ABM outputs estimate that by year 2022, 2.45% of dairy farmers have installed PV. This is a 0.45% difference to the actual PV adoption rate in year 2022. This validates the proposed ABM. The paper demonstrates the increasing interest in PV systems as evidenced by the rate of adoption, shedding light on the potential advantages of PV energy adoption in agriculture. This study possesses the potential to forecast future rates of PV energy adoption among dairy farmers. It establishes a groundwork for further research on predicting and understanding the factors influencing the adoption of renewable energy."

        "abstract": "The growing necessity for sustainable energy solutions underscores the critical need for optimizing solar power systems. Existing methodologies predominantly focus on static strategies with limited adaptability to dynamic environmental and operational conditions, often resulting in suboptimal performance and inefficiency. This research introduces a comprehensive, integrated framework employing Internet of Things (IoT) technologies alongside advanced machine learning and deep learning methodologies to enhance solar power system efficiency and reliability levels. The proposed model integrates four key components: predictive maintenance using Support Vector Machines (SVM) for enhanced anomaly detection, solar power forecasting via Quad Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) neural networks, dynamic load balancing through Reinforcement Learning with Deep Q-learning, and the integration with smart grids employing Decentralized Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with Auction-Based Mechanisms. Each method is selected based on its suitability to address specific challenges within the solar power domain: SVMs for their effectiveness in high-dimensional anomaly detection, QLSTMs for their superior temporal pattern recognition in forecasting, Deep Q-learning for its adaptability in dynamic load management, and MAS for efficient decentralized energy resource coordination operations. The implementation of these methodologies demonstrates significant advancements over traditional approaches. Predictive maintenance facilitated by SVMs leads to a 20% reduction in maintenance costs, while QLSTM-based forecasting achieves a 95% accuracy rate, thereby enhancing grid management and reducing revenue losses. Moreover, reinforcement learning optimizes energy utilization, decreasing wastage and system downtime by 10% and 5% respectively. Lastly, the MAS framework promotes a 20% increase in energy trading efficiency, yielding a 10% reduction in transaction costs and bolstering grid resilience levels. This work represents a significant leap forward in solar power optimization, offering a scalable, efficient, and intelligent framework that paves the way for more sustainable and reliable energy systems. The integration of IoT with machine learning and deep learning presents a paradigm shift in renewable energy management, marking a critical step toward achieving global sustainability objectives.."

Massive amount of data is continuously generated by PV monitoring systems. The data can be used for diagnostics (fault detection and identification) and prognostics using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). The ML models can take the benefit of context available in the domain and acquired along with the data. This paper attempts to leverage context information towards developing a Recurrent Neural Network based model for fault detection in photovoltaic systems. We compared the performance of the proposed context sensitive model with baseline model using real dataset and obtained better results in terms of accuracy, true positive rate, and false positive rate."

        "abstract": "Electrical power systems are crucial, yet vulnerable, due to their complex and interconnected nature, necessitating effective fault detection and diagnostics to ensure stability and prevent disruptions. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have transformed the ability to identify and resolve electrical system problems efficiently. Electrical systems operate at various scales, ranging from individual households to large-scale regional grids. In this study, we focus on medium-scale urban infrastructures. These environments present unique electrical challenges, such as phase imbalances and transient voltage fluctuations, which require robust fault detection mechanisms. This work investigates the use of AI with dynamic programming and a support vector machine (SVM) to improve fault detection. The data collected from voltage measurements in urban office buildings with smart meters over a period of six weeks was used to develop an AI model, demonstrating its applicability to similar urban infrastructures. This model achieved high accuracy in detecting system failures, identifying them with a performance greater than 99%, highlighting the potential of smart sensing technologies combined with AI to improve urban infrastructure management. The integration of smart sensors and advanced data analytics significantly increases the reliability and efficiency of energy systems, promoting sustainable and resilient urban environments."

        "abstract": "Health monitoring and analysis of photovoltaic (PV) systems are critical for optimizing energy efficiency, improving reliability, and extending the operational lifespan of PV power plants. Effective fault detection and monitoring are vital for ensuring the proper functioning and maintenance of these systems. PV power plants operating under fault conditions show significant deviations in current-voltage (I-V) characteristics compared to those under normal conditions. This paper introduces a diagnostic methodology for photovoltaic panels using I-V curves, enhanced by new techniques combining optimization and classification-based artificial intelligence. The research is organized into two key sections. The first section outlines the implementation of a DC/DC buck-boost converter, which is designed to extract and display real-time data from the PV system based on actual (I-V) measurements. The second section focuses on the comprehensive processing of the experimental dataset, where the Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm is combined with machine learning methods to identify the most critical features. The HHO algorithm is combined with an advanced machine learning model, XGBoost, to accurately detect faults within the PV system. The proposed HHO-XGBoost algorithm achieves an impressive accuracy of 99.49%, outperforming other classification-based artificial intelligence methods in fault detection. In validation and comparison with previous approaches, the HHO-XGBoost model consistently outperforms established methods such as GADF-ANN, PCA-SVM, PNN, and Fuzzy Logic, achieving an overall accuracy of 98.48%. This outstanding performance confirms the model\u2019s effectiveness in accurately diagnosing PV system conditions, further validating its robustness and reliability in fault detection and classification."

The authors introduce QC\u2010PCSANN\u2010CHIO\u2010FD, a novel approach that enhances fault detection in electrical power systems by combining quantum computing, deep learning, and optimisation algorithms. The network, based on a Pyramidal Convolution Shuffle Attention Neural Network (PCSANN) optimised with the Coronavirus Herd Immunity Optimiser, shows promising results. Initially, historical datasets are used for fault detection. Preprocessing, which includes handling missing data and outliers using Adaptive Variational Bayesian Filtering is followed by Dual\u2010Domain Feature Extraction to extract grayscale statistical features. These features are processed by PCSANN to detect faults. The Coronavirus Herd Immunity Optimisation Algorithm is proposed to optimise PCSANN for precise fault detection.

        "abstract": "Belt conveyor systems are essential in industries like automotive, aerospace, power generation, and heavy machinery, with idlers playing a crucial role in ensuring the smooth movement of materials. However, constant operation in noisy environments accelerates wear and tear on idlers and obscures early signs of malfunction, such as grinding or rattling from loose parts. This challenge makes early fault detection difficult, increasing downtime and maintenance costs. Therefore, timely and accurate fault detection is vital to prevent severe system issues, ensure optimal performance, and avoid unexpected breakdowns and costly production interruptions. Intelligent fault detection (IFD) using artificial intelligence (AI) methods has emerged as a solution, with machine learning techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) proving effective. This study uses Yet another Audio Mobilenet Network (YAMNet), initially designed for sound event detection (SED), to identify faults in belt conveyor idlers by analyzing their unique acoustic signatures. We enhance detection capabilities by extracting temporal features from YAMNet-generated embeddings using bidirectional long-term memory (BiLSTM) and bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRUs), augmented with a soft attention mechanism. These features are evaluated using extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), achieving an impressive 90% accuracy in fault detection across idler test sets. Our approach was rigorously compared to the VGGish model and validated on the publicly available malfunctioning industrial machine investigation and inspection (MIMII) dataset, where it demonstrated superior performance with AUC scores of 0.8355 for fans, 0.9414 for pumps, 0.9265 for valves, and 0.9703 for sliders. These results significantly improve over baseline scores, with increases of 19.36% for fans, 38.44% for pumps, 67.26% for valves, and 38.61% for sliders. This advancement represents a significant step forward in conveyor system diagnostics, providing a robust solution for enhancing industrial safety and operational efficiency."

        "abstract": "Offshore oil platforms represent some of the most challenging operational environments in the world, where electrical power grids are the lifeline for critical functions such as drilling, production, safety systems, and crew support. These isolated microgrids must maintain exceptional reliability amidst harsh marine conditions\u2014saltwater corrosion, extreme weather, and high humidity\u2014while facing logistical constraints like limited maintenance access and the absence of external power backups. Electrical faults in these settings, such as cable insulation failures, circuit overloads, and power fluctuations, pose severe risks: production downtime costing millions of dollars per day, environmental disasters like oil spills, and safety hazards that threaten human lives. Traditional fault management approaches\u2014reliant on scheduled maintenance, manual inspections, and reactive troubleshooting\u2014fall short in these high-stakes conditions. They often fail to detect incipient faults early enough to prevent escalation, depend heavily on scarce human expertise, and expose personnel to hazardous interventions. This research introduces a groundbreaking AI-driven fault detection model designed to autonomously troubleshoot electrical power grids on offshore oil platforms, integrating deep learning, IoT sensor networks, self-healing mechanisms, and reinforcement learning to deliver a robust, proactive solution tailored to these unique challenges. The cornerstone of this framework is the use of deep learning models to achieve early detection of critical electrical anomalies. Cable insulation failures, a prevalent issue due to saltwater exposure and mechanical stress, are identified using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that analyze high-frequency waveform data sampled at 25.6 kHz. Trained on a dataset of 127,500 labeled samples, including both normal and faulted conditions, the CNN achieves a detection accuracy of 98.2%, identifying degradation up to 62.8 days before critical failure\u2014over eight times earlier than conventional methods. Circuit overloads, driven by variable loads from drilling and processing equipment, are predicted using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which process multi-sensor time-series data to forecast overload conditions with a mean squared error of 0.002 and an average lead time of 4.3 hours. Power fluctuations, often caused by generator instability or harmonic distortions, are detected by a hybrid CNN-LSTM model with 97.3% accuracy, enabling proactive adjustments to mitigate equipment damage and maintain power quality. These models collectively transform fault detection from a reactive process to a predictive one, offering substantial lead times for planned interventions and reducing reliance on emergency repairs. Beyond detection, the system incorporates self-healing electrical grids powered by AI-driven automated rerouting mechanisms. A reinforcement learning (RL) agent, implemented with a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN), models the grid as a multi-agent environment where components like generators, switchgear, and transformers are nodes with dynamic states. Trained in a high-fidelity digital twin simulating real-world fault scenarios, the agent learns optimal switching sequences to isolate faults and reroute power in just 120 milliseconds\u2014over 100 times faster than traditional automated systems and dramatically outpacing manual responses averaging 12.7 minutes. During a 12-month pilot on a North Sea oil platform, this self-healing system mitigated 37 potential disruption events, reducing mean time to resolution by 68% (from 8.2 seconds with conventional automation to 3.1 seconds) and boosting critical load availability from 99.92% to 99.98%. By prioritizing safety-critical loads and balancing generator output, it minimized production interruptions, achieving zero electrical-related shutdowns compared to three in the prior year. This autonomous capability not only enhances grid stability but also reduces personnel exposure to hazardous troubleshooting tasks. IoT-based fault localization forms another critical pillar, enabling precise predictive diagnostics through a network of 867 ruggedized sensors deployed across the platform\u2019s electrical infrastructure. These sensors\u2014measuring voltage, current, temperature, partial discharge, vibration, and environmental factors\u2014are designed to IP68 standards for durability in offshore conditions. Edge computing nodes preprocess data with wavelet denoising and adaptive sampling, reducing bandwidth demands while providing high-resolution insights during anomalies. The system achieves a fault localization accuracy of 0.9 meters\u2014a 23-fold improvement over the 20.8-meter average of traditional methods\u2014using a fusion of traveling wave analysis (pinpointing faults within \u00b12 meters) and impedance-based techniques. Predictive diagnostics extend this capability, with component health models estimating remaining useful life and identifying failure modes with 87.6% accuracy, based on trends like gradual insulation degradation or overheating. In practice, this precision cut average repair time by 63.2% (from 8.7 to 3.2 hours) and shifted the planned-to-emergency maintenance ratio from 1.8:1 to 7.3:1, empowering crews with actionable insights to address issues before they escalate. Reinforcement learning further enhances grid resilience, adapting to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of offshore operations. A Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm optimizes protection settings, load shedding, and preemptive control actions within a simulation environment reflecting real platform data and fault histories. The RL framework improves robustness by 38.1% (from 6.3 to 8.7 on a 10-point scale), accelerates recovery by 76.3% (from 17.3 to 4.1 minutes), and boosts overall resilience by 61.1%. It anticipates cascading failures, leverages redundancy (utilization up from 64.2% to 93.6%), and adjusts strategies based on environmental stressors like temperature spikes or humidity surges. Integration with a digital twin synchronizes real-time data, enabling operators to visualize fault locations, simulate interventions, and preserve institutional knowledge\u2014an invaluable asset as experienced personnel retire. Field deployment validated these advancements: fault detection time dropped by 87% (from hours to minutes), downtime decreased by 73% (from 27.3 to 7.4 hours annually), and grid reliability rose by 64% (SAIFI from 4.8 to 1.7 interruptions per year). Economically, the system delivered a net annual benefit of $5.24 million per platform, with a 551% return on investment, driven by $3.75 million in avoided production losses and $1.23 million in maintenance savings. Safety benefits were equally profound, with electrical incidents falling 78.4% (from 3.7 to 0.8 per year) and personnel exposure hours reduced by 76.7% (from 1,872 to 437 annually). Challenges include sensor reliability (3.2% failure rate in harsh conditions), limited historical fault data for rare events, and cybersecurity risks from expanded connectivity, necessitating robust encryption and anomaly detection. This AI-driven model integrates deep learning, IoT, reinforcement learning, and smart grid technologies into a cohesive, autonomous solution, addressing the offshore industry\u2019s pressing needs for safety, reliability, and efficiency.

        "abstract": "Gearboxes are autonomous devices essential for power transmission in various mechanical systems. When a failure occurs, it can lead to an inability to perform the required functions, potentially resulting in a complete shutdown of the mechanism and causing significant operational disruptions. Consequently, deploying expert methods for fault detection and diagnosis is crucial to ensuring the reliability and efficiency of these systems. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques show promise for fault diagnosis, but their accuracy can be hindered by noise and manufacturing imperfections that distort mechanical signatures. Thorough data analysis and preprocessing are vital to preserving these critical features. Validating approaches through numerical simulations before experimentation is essential to identify model limitations and minimize risks. A hybrid approach, combining AI and physics-based models, could provide a robust solution by leveraging the strengths of both domains: AI for its ability to process large volumes of data and physics-based models for their reliability in modeling complex mechanical behaviors. This paper proposes a comprehensive diagnostic methodology. It starts with feature extraction from time-domain analysis, which helps identify critical indicators of gearbox performance. Following this, a feature selection process is applied using the Fisher criterion, which ensures that only the most relevant features are retained for further analysis. These selected features are then employed to train an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), a sophisticated approach that combines the learning capabilities of neural networks with the reasoning abilities of fuzzy logic. The proposed methodology is evaluated using a dataset of gear faults generated through energy simulations based on a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) model, followed by a secondary validation on an experimental dataset."

A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) ANN, optimised with 10 hidden layers and the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, achieved near-perfect regression (correlation coefficient R > 0.999 ) and classification accuracy (\u224899%) using 9,180 operational samples, validated against IEEE-compliant transient stability indices (Si) and dynamic voltage margins (DVm). Comparatively, SVMs demonstrated ~95\u201398% accuracy with sub-5 \u00a0inference times, using pre-engineered features (such as harmonic distortions and wavelet coefficients) for real-time efficiency in resource-constrained environments. The study proposed a hybrid ANN-SVM framework, combining SVM\u2019s rapid fault detection with ANN\u2019s precision for post-event diagnostics, addressing the speed-accuracy trade-off in dynamic grids. Engineering implications highlight enhanced grid resilience, cost-effective deployment strategies, and support for renewable integration. At the same time, contributions include empirical validation of AI models in sparse-data contexts and methodological benchmarks aligning machine learning with power quality standards. Recommendations advocated phased AI adoption, workforce training, and regulatory standardisation, with future research directions spanning hardware-in-the-loop validation, cybersecurity, and adaptive learning for renewable-rich grids. This work bridges theoretical AI advancements with practical power system needs, offering scalable solutions for global energy transitions."

        "abstract": "In the dynamic energy sphere in the U.S., operational dependability of gas turbine engines becomes vital to the continuous power production and sustenance of the national grid. Peak and baseload power production, the mainstay of gas turbines, is exposed to high thermal, mechanical, and chemical stresses that lead to wear out of components over time. Traditionally, maintenance practices have either been reactive or time-based, based upon fixed intervals, which has led to premature replacement of components, or vice versa, undetected degradation leading to catastrophic failure. Such approaches carry high operating costs, lower turbine availability, and jeopardize plant safety. The central objective of this research is to build and test an AI-driven fault detection system to identify early signs of failure in gas turbine engines and apply it specifically to deployment within the energy sector of the U.S. Improving gas turbine performance is essential to raising the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of power production systems. The dataset used in this research entails high-resolution operational parameters gathered from different industrial gas turbines operating within U.S. energy facilities. Engine operational data includes multiple time-dependent measurements that monitor essential parameters like turbine temperature at the inlet and outlet and rotational speed, torque measurements alongside vibration levels and power output, fuel rate and intake pressure, and exhaust temperature and oil temperature. Real-time data acquisition from embedded sensor arrays allowed researchers to track turbine performance throughout changing operational states at sub-minute data points. A centralized time-stamping system maintains channel synchronization, thus allowing analysts to draw accurate conclusions about operational states throughout the recorded period. To support strong and interpretable fault detection, we utilized a variety of machine learning models, each chosen for its specific strength at discriminating operations from fault conditions in gas turbines. We used a multi-metric-based evaluation approach that combined statistical validity with operational applicability to assess each model's fault detection capability. Logistic Regression attained the highest accuracy, followed very closely by Random Forest. XG-Boost attained the lowest accuracy of all three algorithms. The use of AI-driven fault detection under predictive maintenance has the potential to revolutionize U.S. power plants using gas turbines as the primary source of electricity generation. In the fiercely competitive and heavily regulated environment of the U.S. energy industry, fault anticipation presents the key to competitive advantage. Using AI-based diagnostics reduces manual checks and simplifies the servicing process by prioritizing technician resources to confirmed at-risk components. AI-powered fault detection is critical to improving grid resilience within the U.S. energy infrastructure by assuring that peak-demand-balancing and grid-stabilizing gas turbines remain fault-free."

        "abstract": "The global shift toward renewable energy, particularly wind power, underscores the critical need for advanced fault diagnosis systems to optimize wind turbine reliability and efficiency. While traditional diagnostic methods remain foundational, their limitations in addressing the nonlinear dynamics and operational complexity of modern turbines have accelerated the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven approaches. This review systematically examines advancements in AI-based fault diagnosis techniques, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), from 2019 to 2024, analyzing their evolution, efficacy, and practical challenges. Drawing on a curated selection of 55 studies (identified via structured searches across IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science), the paper prioritizes research employing data-driven or model-based methodologies with explicit experimental validation and clearly documented data sources. The excluded works lacked English accessibility, validation, or data transparency. Focusing on high-impact faults in gearboxes, blades, and generators, these components are responsible for over 70% of turbine failures, the review maps prevalent ML and DL algorithms, such as CNNs, LSTMs, and SVMs, to specific fault types, revealing hybrid AI models and real-world data integration as key drivers of diagnostic accuracy. Critical gaps are identified, including overreliance on simulated datasets and inconsistent signal preprocessing, which hinder real-world applicability. This study concludes with actionable recommendations for future research, advocating adaptive noise-filtering techniques, scalable hybrid architectures, and standardized benchmarking using operational turbine data. By bridging theoretical AI advancements with practical deployment challenges, this work aims to inform next-generation fault diagnosis systems, enhancing turbine longevity and supporting global renewable energy goals."

        "abstract": "Due to its high sensitivity to small amounts of electrical faults, dissolved gas analysis (DGA) is a popular method for identifying faults in power transformers. The early prediction of fault type in transformers is a crucial part of power system reliability. As a result of this, it is extremely essential to keep a close eye on the behaviour of the power transformer while in service. Periodic monitoring of the condition of power transformers is important to prevent power outages. Early fault detection can result in substantial operational and maintenance cost savings, as well as the prevention of any early breakdown or failure. The current research study aims to assist experts in precisely diagnosing power transformer faults by providing an alternative to the drawbacks that classical DGA methods viz. Dornensburg ratio, Rogers' ratio, IEC ratio, and Key gas possess i.e., the lack of a proper diagnosis for instances that do not fall under the usual DGA codes. This work proposes an artificial intelligence (AI)-based fault diagnoses algorithm, which is a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for improving the diagnostic accuracy of existing DGA methods. According to the author's knowledge, there are no existing research works that have developed an SVM-based fault classification approach using Google Colab. As a result, the proposed work contributes to the fault diagnostics of power transformers. The results presented in this research showed that the proposed method SVM has high accuracy in diagnosing faults in power transformers as compared to the four methods presented."

        "abstract": "Real-world automated systems such as building automation, power plants, and more have benefited from data-driven learning methodologies for anomaly detection and diagnosis. Typically, these methodologies heavily rely on prior knowledge related to abnormal operations, i.e., data points labeled as anomalies. However, in practice, such labelled data points are often unavailable which poses challenges in effective anomaly detection, particularly in diagnosis. In this paper, we propose One-class Classification Cluster ENsembles ( OCCEN ) anomaly detection and diagnosis approach for multivariate time series data. OCCEN utilizes one-class classification learning methods for anomaly detection followed by the decomposition of anomalies into multiple clusters. Then each cluster is treated as a binary classification problem and classifiers are trained to learn cluster representations. These trained models in combination with explainable AI models are used to generate a ranked list of diagnoses, i.e., features. Finally, we re-rank those features to account for temporal dependencies through the dynamic time-warping technique. The practical evaluation of OCCEN for air handling units (AHU) demonstrates its effectiveness in identifying faults. The framework consistently outperforms the baseline in fault diagnosis, as higher scores are observed for detection and diagnostic evaluation metrics, including F1 score, intersection over union, HitRate@ k , and RootCause@ k ."

        "abstract": "Global efforts to address climate change have intensified the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, positioning wind power as a critical player due to its advanced technology, scalability, and environmental benefits. Despite their potential, the reliability of wind turbines, particularly their gearboxes, remains a persistent challenge. Gearbox failures lead to significant downtime, high maintenance costs, and reduced operational efficiency, threatening the economic competitiveness of wind energy. This study proposes an innovative condition monitoring model for wind turbine gearboxes, utilizing Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems and Deep Learning techniques. The model analyzes historical operating data from wind turbine to classify gearbox conditions into normal and abnormal states. Optimizing the dataset for deep neural networks through advanced data processing methods achieves an impressive fault detection accuracy of 98.8%. Designed for seamless integration into real-time monitoring systems, this approach enables early fault prediction and supports proactive maintenance strategies. By enhancing gearbox reliability, reducing unplanned downtime, and lowering maintenance expenses, the model improves the overall economic viability of wind farms. This advancement reinforces wind energy\u2019s pivotal role in driving a sustainable, low-carbon future, aligning with global climate goals and renewable energy adoption."

        "abstract": "Pneumatic-hydraulic actuated ball valves are critical components in pipeline rupture protection and emergency shutdown systems for large-diameter natural gas transmission pipelines. Traditional maintenance methods, relying on periodic inspections and reactive maintenance, often result in delayed fault detection, which increases safety risks. In order to address this challenge, this study proposes an innovative intelligent fault diagnosis approach that significantly enhances early fault detection and predictive maintenance without requiring structural modifications to the valve. The main contributions of this work are: 1) the development of a novel time-frequency analysis-based feature extraction method for current and pressure signals, which improves fault signature reliability and distinguishes fault patterns more effectively; and 2) the application of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks optimized using an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm, achieving 100% diagnostic accuracy for both solenoid valve and mechanical faults. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach, with field tests successfully detecting torque anomalies and identifying risks related to solenoid valve power-off logic. This approach provides a robust solution for transitioning from preventive to predictive maintenance, significantly improving operational safety and pipeline reliability."

        "abstract": "Power transformer is a critical component for generation, transmission and distribution utility. It is expensive equipment and plays vital role in interconnecting renewable energy with main grid. The distribution transformers are installed at different locations in a power system and are critical assets in the electricity supply system as they feed power supply to the end users. In this era of deregulation, priority is given by utilities for uninterrupted and quality power supply to their consumers. However, distribution transformers are normally neglected components; less maintenance and less care have been taken in comparison with power transformers. Transformer failure causes extensive loss to the power utility, major industrial consumer and society. Proper operation and maintenance procedure may avoid failures and maintain the continuous power supply for end user. Due to these reasons conditioning monitoring of transformer become popular. Condition monitoring of transformer results in increase life span, reducing the risk of expensive equipments failure and increase high level reliability. An overview of various traditional and some new conditioning monitoring techniques are covered in this paper. The methods discussed in this paper are useful for both the power transformers and distribution transformers."

The insulating oil degrades as it comes under thermal and electrical stress due to continuous operation. This cause\u2019s incipient fault leads to catastrophic transformer failure if precautionary measures are not provided. This paper presents condition monitoring techniques such as Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) and UV-visible spectroscopy. The health status of the transformer is carried out by accurately analyzing the gas contents using DGA technique and at the same time assessment of the oil is carried out using UV-visible spectroscopy by measuring light absorbance at different wavelengths. The combined application of these two techniques facilitates an accurate diagnosis of transformer conditions, enabling effective preventive measures against potential failures."

        "abstract": "In power energy distribution networks, switchgear is considered critical equipment. This is because the act of monitoring the operation and condition of switchgear, as well as performing the required corrective maintenance on any potentially problematic equipment, is critical. A single event may harm thousands of customers over time and pose a significant risk to operational staff. Many considerations must be put in place before using outages to switch down the system since they may raise maintenance costs and disrupt the power supply to users. As a result, proper interpretation of switchgear status evaluations is critical for the early identification of possible faults. Existing ultrasound condition-based monitoring (CBM) diagnostic testing techniques require the tester to manually interpret test data. This study aims to review the status of the recent development of CBM techniques with faults in switchgear. The current trend in electrification will be toward the safety and sustainability of power grid assets, which involves an evaluation of the electrical systems\u2019 and components\u2019 health and grids for medium-voltage distribution. This work provides a current state-of-the-art evaluation of deep learning (DL)-based smart diagnostics that were used to identify partial discharges and localize them. DL techniques are discussed and categorized, with special attention given to those sophisticated in the last five years. The key features of each method, such as fundamental approach and accuracy, are outlined and compared in depth. The benefits and drawbacks of various DL algorithms are also examined. The technological constraints that hinder sophisticated PD diagnostics from being implemented in companies are also recognized. Lastly, various remedies are suggested, as well as future research prospects."

        "abstract": "Industrial maintenance has become an essential strategic factor for profit and productivity in industrial systems. In the modern industrial context, condition-based maintenance guides the interventions and repairs according to the machine\u2019s health status, calculated from monitoring variables and using statistical and computational techniques. Although several literature reviews address condition-based maintenance, no study discusses the application of these techniques in the hydroelectric sector, a fundamental source of renewable energy. We conducted a systematic literature review of articles published in the area of condition-based maintenance in the last 10\u2009years. This was followed by quantitative and thematic analyses of the most relevant categories that compose the phases of condition-based maintenance. We identified a research trend in the application of machine learning techniques, both in the diagnosis and the prognosis of the generating unit\u2019s assets, being vibration the most frequently discussed monitoring variable. Finally, there is a vast field to be explored regarding the application of statistical models to estimate the useful life, and hybrid models based on physical models and specialists\u2019 knowledge, of turbine-generators."

        "abstract": "In the dynamic landscape of renewable energy, the primary goal continues to be the enhancement of competitiveness through the implementation of cutting-edge technologies. This requires a strategic focus on reducing energy costs and maximizing system performance. Within this framework, the continuous online monitoring of assets is essential for efficient operations, by conducting measurements that describe the condition of various components. However, the execution of these measurements can present technical and economic obstacles. To overcome these challenges, the implementation of indirect measurement techniques emerges as a viable solution. By leveraging measurements obtained in easily accessible areas, these methods enable the estimation of quantities in regions that would otherwise be inaccessible. This approach improves the monitoring process\u2019s efficiency and provides previously unattainable information. Adopting indirect measurement techniques is also cost-effective, allowing the replacement of expensive sensors with existing infrastructure, which cuts down on installation costs and labor. This paper offers a detailed state-of-the-art review by providing an in-depth examination and classification of indirect measurement techniques and virtual sensing methods applied in the field of renewable energies. It also identifies and discusses the existing challenges and limitations within this topic and explores potential future developments."

        "abstract": "Managing resources is crucial in increasing capacity utilization, reducing expenses, and increasing revenue in the current world economy. Analytical techniques, rooted in historical context, machine learning, and statistical models, provide innovative approaches to resource management in industries such as healthcare, retail, manufacturing, and energy. This paper explores predictive analytics through key methodologies, including time series forecasting, regression analysis, clustering, and optimization, to enhance resource distribution and decision-making tools. Forecasting enables more effective, efficient, and less risky planning by allowing organizations to prepare for expected demand, workload, and disruptions in supply and demand, workforce distribution, inventory, and assets. By addressing challenges such as overstocking, overstaffing, or resource shortages, organizations can optimize operations. Key applications include workforce management, inventory management, supply chain management, and condition monitoring or predictive maintenance. The advantages, such as cost reduction, increased productivity, and improved customer satisfaction, are supported with practical examples. However, challenges such as data quality, model interpretability, and scalability remain significant barriers to broader adoption. Best practices identified include integrating predictive models with existing systems and fostering a data-oriented organizational culture. With advancements in technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, predictive analytics remains central to digital transformation by enabling timely and adaptive resource allocation. This study underscores predictive analytics' transformative potential for resource management, providing actionable insights to help organizations navigate dynamic environments."

        "abstract": "Subsea power cables are critical assets for electrical transmission and distribution networks, and highly relevant to regional, national, and international energy security and decarbonization given the growth in offshore renewable energy generation. Existing condition monitoring techniques are restricted to highly constrained online monitoring systems that only prioritize internal failure modes, representing only 30% of cable failure mechanisms, and has limited capacity to provide precursor indicators of such failures or damages. To overcome these limitations, we propose an innovative fusion prognostics approach that can provide the in situ integrity analysis of the subsea cable. In this paper, we developed low-frequency wide-band sonar (LFWBS) technology to collect acoustic response data from different subsea power cable sample types, with different inner structure configurations, and collate signatures from induced physical failure modes as to obtain integrity data at various cable degradation levels. We demonstrate how a machine learning approach, e.g., SVM, KNN, BP, and CNN algorithms, can be used for integrity analysis under a hybrid, holistic condition monitoring framework. The results of data analysis demonstrate the ability to distinguish subsea cables by differences of 5 mm in diameter and cable types, as well as achieving an overall 95%+ accuracy rate to detect different cable degradation stages. We also present a tailored, hybrid prognostic and health management solution for subsea cables, for cable remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. Our findings addresses a clear capability and knowledge gap in evaluating and forecasting subsea cable RUL. Thus, supporting a more advanced asset management and planning capability for critical subsea power cables."

        "abstract": "Ongoing technological advancements have made it possible to design very compact industrial rotating machines that offer significantly better performances with regards to conservation of energy and materials. Consequently, such compactness implies that several failure modes are becoming more intertwined, thereby increasing downtime associated with faults classification and diagnosis. Data fusion approaches such as coherent composite spectra (CCS) and poly coherent composite spectra (pCCS) have proven very useful for reducing overall faults classification times through the harmonisation of condition monitoring data from multiple locations into a single CCS or pCCS. This approach has made it possible for owners of physical industrial assets (PIA) to swiftly ascertain the condition of their assets without necessarily possessing significant expertise in rotating machine condition monitoring. As useful as the results of the techniques are, they have been solely applied for individualized or singular faults. However, rotating machines faults seldom occur in isolation, which makes it imperative to examine the proficiency of CCS and pCCS features under combined faults scenarios. This study considers 4 distinct cases of which 3 are singular (i.e. healthy baseline, bent shaft and shaft rub) and a combined bent-rub case. CCS data fusion was initially used to rationalize measured vibration data from all sensor locations, after which principal component analysis (PCA) and kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) are used to reduce output data dimensionality. Finally, the most representative features are then automatically classified using artificial neural network (ANN). The above steps are integrated to form a smart fault detection and diagnosis framework. Details of the approach and results obtained are described in the paper."

The continuous monitoring and \nupdating of asset data reveal where the assets are located and which needs \nmaintenance or which lies in critical condition. The system helps to save time \nand reduce visits to the sites and labour reduction."

        "abstract": "In the largest Australian-owned Brewery, loss of production can occur due to stoppages of critical pumps. The reliability team of this plant ensures the availability of assets using vibration condition monitoring. One of the critical assets, an energy store delivery pump, suffered bearing failures between two and three times a year because of high vibration due to resonance forcing frequency. Previous attempts to resolve the problem by different contractors by adding support structures were unsuccessful leading to further review and investigation. This paper describes how we used a combination of four techniques including vibration analysis, finite element analysis, motion amplification camera, and mathematical approach to address the resonance issue. Vibration data was collected on the bearings of the motor and pump, the spectrum showed resonance at forcing frequencies of 18 Hz and 50 Hz as the root cause of the high vibration. The pipe\u2019s supports were modelled in a CAD package, and a Finite Element Analysis program calculated the natural frequencies and their mode shapes. The natural frequencies were also calculated, using a five degree of freedom model of cantilever beams, to verify the results. A Motion Amplification Camera also measured the resonant modes of the base structure of the pump, the pipe, and the support frames. The values of the natural frequencies from the FEA, calculations, and MAC validate the results. We found that the natural frequency of the structure was close to the running speed of the pump. Data from these techniques was used to design new supports. The stiffness of the structure was increased by replacing the square section supports (80x80 mm) with I-beams (150 x 150 mm) and adding angle sections diagonally for triangulation. The overall vibration across the asset was reduced by 98% to an acceptable level. The pump bearings have not failed since the new frame was installed, increasing the reliability of the asset for production."

        "abstract": "Operational readiness, reliability and safety are all enhanced through condition monitoring. That said, for many assets, there is still a need for a prognostic capability to calculate remaining useful life (RUL). RUL allows operation and maintenance personnel to better schedule assets, and logisticians to order long lead time part to help improve balance of plant/asset availability. While a number of RUL techniques have been reported, we have focused on fatigue crack growth models (as opposed to physics or deep learning of based models). This paper compares the performance of stress intensity models (linear elastic model, e.g. Paris\u2019 Law), to Head\u2019s theory (geomatical similarity hypothesis) and to Dislocation/Energy theories of crack growth. It will be shown that these models differ mainly in the crack growth exponent, and that this leads to large differences in the estimation of RUL during early state fault propagation, though the results of all three models converge as the RUL is shorted."

        "abstract": "Offshore high voltage DC (HVDC) wind farms offer a promising solution to growing energy demands in the future. Condition monitoring of substation assets is essential for reliable and resilient operation of electrical networks. Existing condition monitoring techniques for onshore substation and electrical network assets include regular and scheduled on-site visits by trained personnel to substation sites. However, such routine inspection is not a cost-effective solution for offshore sites. In cases where the accessibility to network assets becomes difficult, robotic and autonomous condition monitoring provides a solution. Such a robotic/autonomous solution would need to interact with the surrounding substation environment, without increasing the risk of electrical breakdown and flashovers between different energized components. In Part A of this paper, the effect of high electrostatic fields on an inspection unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is analyzed, with respect to: 1) AC corona emissions interference on the UAV, and 2) Air breakdown clearance characteristics. Both simulations and experiment results presented in the paper show the impact of corona emissions interference to both UAV autopilot and actuation sections, which requires a shielding mitigation solution. Also, experiment results show the limited effect of introducing a shielding solution on increasing the flashover risk between valve hall towers."
