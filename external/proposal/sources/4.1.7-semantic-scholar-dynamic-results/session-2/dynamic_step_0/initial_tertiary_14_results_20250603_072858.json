      "abstract": "Power transformer is a critical component for generation, transmission and distribution utility. It is expensive equipment and plays vital role in interconnecting renewable energy with main grid. The distribution transformers are installed at different locations in a power system and are critical assets in the electricity supply system as they feed power supply to the end users. In this era of deregulation, priority is given by utilities for uninterrupted and quality power supply to their consumers. However, distribution transformers are normally neglected components; less maintenance and less care have been taken in comparison with power transformers. Transformer failure causes extensive loss to the power utility, major industrial consumer and society. Proper operation and maintenance procedure may avoid failures and maintain the continuous power supply for end user. Due to these reasons conditioning monitoring of transformer become popular. Condition monitoring of transformer results in increase life span, reducing the risk of expensive equipments failure and increase high level reliability. An overview of various traditional and some new conditioning monitoring techniques are covered in this paper. The methods discussed in this paper are useful for both the power transformers and distribution transformers."

The insulating oil degrades as it comes under thermal and electrical stress due to continuous operation. This cause\u2019s incipient fault leads to catastrophic transformer failure if precautionary measures are not provided. This paper presents condition monitoring techniques such as Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) and UV-visible spectroscopy. The health status of the transformer is carried out by accurately analyzing the gas contents using DGA technique and at the same time assessment of the oil is carried out using UV-visible spectroscopy by measuring light absorbance at different wavelengths. The combined application of these two techniques facilitates an accurate diagnosis of transformer conditions, enabling effective preventive measures against potential failures."

      "abstract": "In power energy distribution networks, switchgear is considered critical equipment. This is because the act of monitoring the operation and condition of switchgear, as well as performing the required corrective maintenance on any potentially problematic equipment, is critical. A single event may harm thousands of customers over time and pose a significant risk to operational staff. Many considerations must be put in place before using outages to switch down the system since they may raise maintenance costs and disrupt the power supply to users. As a result, proper interpretation of switchgear status evaluations is critical for the early identification of possible faults. Existing ultrasound condition-based monitoring (CBM) diagnostic testing techniques require the tester to manually interpret test data. This study aims to review the status of the recent development of CBM techniques with faults in switchgear. The current trend in electrification will be toward the safety and sustainability of power grid assets, which involves an evaluation of the electrical systems\u2019 and components\u2019 health and grids for medium-voltage distribution. This work provides a current state-of-the-art evaluation of deep learning (DL)-based smart diagnostics that were used to identify partial discharges and localize them. DL techniques are discussed and categorized, with special attention given to those sophisticated in the last five years. The key features of each method, such as fundamental approach and accuracy, are outlined and compared in depth. The benefits and drawbacks of various DL algorithms are also examined. The technological constraints that hinder sophisticated PD diagnostics from being implemented in companies are also recognized. Lastly, various remedies are suggested, as well as future research prospects."

In the modern industrial context, condition-based maintenance guides the interventions and repairs according to the machine\u2019s health status, calculated from monitoring variables and using statistical and computational techniques. Although several literature reviews address condition-based maintenance, no study discusses the application of these techniques in the hydroelectric sector, a fundamental source of renewable energy. We conducted a systematic literature review of articles published in the area of condition-based maintenance in the last 10\u2009years. This was followed by quantitative and thematic analyses of the most relevant categories that compose the phases of condition-based maintenance. We identified a research trend in the application of machine learning techniques, both in the diagnosis and the prognosis of the generating unit\u2019s assets, being vibration the most frequently discussed monitoring variable. Finally, there is a vast field to be explored regarding the application of statistical models to estimate the useful life, and hybrid models based on physical models and specialists\u2019 knowledge, of turbine-generators."

      "abstract": "In the dynamic landscape of renewable energy, the primary goal continues to be the enhancement of competitiveness through the implementation of cutting-edge technologies. This requires a strategic focus on reducing energy costs and maximizing system performance. Within this framework, the continuous online monitoring of assets is essential for efficient operations, by conducting measurements that describe the condition of various components. However, the execution of these measurements can present technical and economic obstacles. To overcome these challenges, the implementation of indirect measurement techniques emerges as a viable solution. By leveraging measurements obtained in easily accessible areas, these methods enable the estimation of quantities in regions that would otherwise be inaccessible. This approach improves the monitoring process\u2019s efficiency and provides previously unattainable information. Adopting indirect measurement techniques is also cost-effective, allowing the replacement of expensive sensors with existing infrastructure, which cuts down on installation costs and labor. This paper offers a detailed state-of-the-art review by providing an in-depth examination and classification of indirect measurement techniques and virtual sensing methods applied in the field of renewable energies. It also identifies and discusses the existing challenges and limitations within this topic and explores potential future developments."

      "abstract": "Managing resources is crucial in increasing capacity utilization, reducing expenses, and increasing revenue in the current world economy. Analytical techniques, rooted in historical context, machine learning, and statistical models, provide innovative approaches to resource management in industries such as healthcare, retail, manufacturing, and energy. This paper explores predictive analytics through key methodologies, including time series forecasting, regression analysis, clustering, and optimization, to enhance resource distribution and decision-making tools. Forecasting enables more effective, efficient, and less risky planning by allowing organizations to prepare for expected demand, workload, and disruptions in supply and demand, workforce distribution, inventory, and assets. By addressing challenges such as overstocking, overstaffing, or resource shortages, organizations can optimize operations. Key applications include workforce management, inventory management, supply chain management, and condition monitoring or predictive maintenance. The advantages, such as cost reduction, increased productivity, and improved customer satisfaction, are supported with practical examples. However, challenges such as data quality, model interpretability, and scalability remain significant barriers to broader adoption. Best practices identified include integrating predictive models with existing systems and fostering a data-oriented organizational culture. With advancements in technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, predictive analytics remains central to digital transformation by enabling timely and adaptive resource allocation. This study underscores predictive analytics' transformative potential for resource management, providing actionable insights to help organizations navigate dynamic environments."

      "abstract": "Subsea power cables are critical assets for electrical transmission and distribution networks, and highly relevant to regional, national, and international energy security and decarbonization given the growth in offshore renewable energy generation. Existing condition monitoring techniques are restricted to highly constrained online monitoring systems that only prioritize internal failure modes, representing only 30% of cable failure mechanisms, and has limited capacity to provide precursor indicators of such failures or damages. To overcome these limitations, we propose an innovative fusion prognostics approach that can provide the in situ integrity analysis of the subsea cable. In this paper, we developed low-frequency wide-band sonar (LFWBS) technology to collect acoustic response data from different subsea power cable sample types, with different inner structure configurations, and collate signatures from induced physical failure modes as to obtain integrity data at various cable degradation levels. We demonstrate how a machine learning approach, e.g., SVM, KNN, BP, and CNN algorithms, can be used for integrity analysis under a hybrid, holistic condition monitoring framework. The results of data analysis demonstrate the ability to distinguish subsea cables by differences of 5 mm in diameter and cable types, as well as achieving an overall 95%+ accuracy rate to detect different cable degradation stages. We also present a tailored, hybrid prognostic and health management solution for subsea cables, for cable remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. Our findings addresses a clear capability and knowledge gap in evaluating and forecasting subsea cable RUL. Thus, supporting a more advanced asset management and planning capability for critical subsea power cables."

      "abstract": "Ongoing technological advancements have made it possible to design very compact industrial rotating machines that offer significantly better performances with regards to conservation of energy and materials. Consequently, such compactness implies that several failure modes are becoming more intertwined, thereby increasing downtime associated with faults classification and diagnosis. Data fusion approaches such as coherent composite spectra (CCS) and poly coherent composite spectra (pCCS) have proven very useful for reducing overall faults classification times through the harmonisation of condition monitoring data from multiple locations into a single CCS or pCCS. This approach has made it possible for owners of physical industrial assets (PIA) to swiftly ascertain the condition of their assets without necessarily possessing significant expertise in rotating machine condition monitoring. As useful as the results of the techniques are, they have been solely applied for individualized or singular faults. However, rotating machines faults seldom occur in isolation, which makes it imperative to examine the proficiency of CCS and pCCS features under combined faults scenarios. This study considers 4 distinct cases of which 3 are singular (i.e. healthy baseline, bent shaft and shaft rub) and a combined bent-rub case. CCS data fusion was initially used to rationalize measured vibration data from all sensor locations, after which principal component analysis (PCA) and kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) are used to reduce output data dimensionality. Finally, the most representative features are then automatically classified using artificial neural network (ANN). The above steps are integrated to form a smart fault detection and diagnosis framework. Details of the approach and results obtained are described in the paper."

      "abstract": "In the largest Australian-owned Brewery, loss of production can occur due to stoppages of critical pumps. The reliability team of this plant ensures the availability of assets using vibration condition monitoring. One of the critical assets, an energy store delivery pump, suffered bearing failures between two and three times a year because of high vibration due to resonance forcing frequency. Previous attempts to resolve the problem by different contractors by adding support structures were unsuccessful leading to further review and investigation. This paper describes how we used a combination of four techniques including vibration analysis, finite element analysis, motion amplification camera, and mathematical approach to address the resonance issue. Vibration data was collected on the bearings of the motor and pump, the spectrum showed resonance at forcing frequencies of 18 Hz and 50 Hz as the root cause of the high vibration. The pipe\u2019s supports were modelled in a CAD package, and a Finite Element Analysis program calculated the natural frequencies and their mode shapes. The natural frequencies were also calculated, using a five degree of freedom model of cantilever beams, to verify the results. A Motion Amplification Camera also measured the resonant modes of the base structure of the pump, the pipe, and the support frames. The values of the natural frequencies from the FEA, calculations, and MAC validate the results. We found that the natural frequency of the structure was close to the running speed of the pump. Data from these techniques was used to design new supports. The stiffness of the structure was increased by replacing the square section supports (80x80 mm) with I-beams (150 x 150 mm) and adding angle sections diagonally for triangulation. The overall vibration across the asset was reduced by 98% to an acceptable level. The pump bearings have not failed since the new frame was installed, increasing the reliability of the asset for production."

      "abstract": "Operational readiness, reliability and safety are all enhanced through condition monitoring. That said, for many assets, there is still a need for a prognostic capability to calculate remaining useful life (RUL). RUL allows operation and maintenance personnel to better schedule assets, and logisticians to order long lead time part to help improve balance of plant/asset availability. While a number of RUL techniques have been reported, we have focused on fatigue crack growth models (as opposed to physics or deep learning of based models). This paper compares the performance of stress intensity models (linear elastic model, e.g. Paris\u2019 Law), to Head\u2019s theory (geomatical similarity hypothesis) and to Dislocation/Energy theories of crack growth. It will be shown that these models differ mainly in the crack growth exponent, and that this leads to large differences in the estimation of RUL during early state fault propagation, though the results of all three models converge as the RUL is shorted."

      "abstract": "Offshore high voltage DC (HVDC) wind farms offer a promising solution to growing energy demands in the future. Condition monitoring of substation assets is essential for reliable and resilient operation of electrical networks. Existing condition monitoring techniques for onshore substation and electrical network assets include regular and scheduled on-site visits by trained personnel to substation sites. However, such routine inspection is not a cost-effective solution for offshore sites. In cases where the accessibility to network assets becomes difficult, robotic and autonomous condition monitoring provides a solution. Such a robotic/autonomous solution would need to interact with the surrounding substation environment, without increasing the risk of electrical breakdown and flashovers between different energized components. In Part A of this paper, the effect of high electrostatic fields on an inspection unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is analyzed, with respect to: 1) AC corona emissions interference on the UAV, and 2) Air breakdown clearance characteristics. Both simulations and experiment results presented in the paper show the impact of corona emissions interference to both UAV autopilot and actuation sections, which requires a shielding mitigation solution. Also, experiment results show the limited effect of introducing a shielding solution on increasing the flashover risk between valve hall towers."
