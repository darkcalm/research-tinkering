Massive amount of data is continuously generated by PV monitoring systems. The data can be used for diagnostics (fault detection and identification) and prognostics using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). The ML models can take the benefit of context available in the domain and acquired along with the data. This paper attempts to leverage context information towards developing a Recurrent Neural Network based model for fault detection in photovoltaic systems. We compared the performance of the proposed context sensitive model with baseline model using real dataset and obtained better results in terms of accuracy, true positive rate, and false positive rate."

      "abstract": "Electrical power systems are crucial, yet vulnerable, due to their complex and interconnected nature, necessitating effective fault detection and diagnostics to ensure stability and prevent disruptions. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have transformed the ability to identify and resolve electrical system problems efficiently. Electrical systems operate at various scales, ranging from individual households to large-scale regional grids. In this study, we focus on medium-scale urban infrastructures. These environments present unique electrical challenges, such as phase imbalances and transient voltage fluctuations, which require robust fault detection mechanisms. This work investigates the use of AI with dynamic programming and a support vector machine (SVM) to improve fault detection. The data collected from voltage measurements in urban office buildings with smart meters over a period of six weeks was used to develop an AI model, demonstrating its applicability to similar urban infrastructures. This model achieved high accuracy in detecting system failures, identifying them with a performance greater than 99%, highlighting the potential of smart sensing technologies combined with AI to improve urban infrastructure management. The integration of smart sensors and advanced data analytics significantly increases the reliability and efficiency of energy systems, promoting sustainable and resilient urban environments."

      "abstract": "Health monitoring and analysis of photovoltaic (PV) systems are critical for optimizing energy efficiency, improving reliability, and extending the operational lifespan of PV power plants. Effective fault detection and monitoring are vital for ensuring the proper functioning and maintenance of these systems. PV power plants operating under fault conditions show significant deviations in current-voltage (I-V) characteristics compared to those under normal conditions. This paper introduces a diagnostic methodology for photovoltaic panels using I-V curves, enhanced by new techniques combining optimization and classification-based artificial intelligence. The research is organized into two key sections. The first section outlines the implementation of a DC/DC buck-boost converter, which is designed to extract and display real-time data from the PV system based on actual (I-V) measurements. The second section focuses on the comprehensive processing of the experimental dataset, where the Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm is combined with machine learning methods to identify the most critical features. The HHO algorithm is combined with an advanced machine learning model, XGBoost, to accurately detect faults within the PV system. The proposed HHO-XGBoost algorithm achieves an impressive accuracy of 99.49%, outperforming other classification-based artificial intelligence methods in fault detection. In validation and comparison with previous approaches, the HHO-XGBoost model consistently outperforms established methods such as GADF-ANN, PCA-SVM, PNN, and Fuzzy Logic, achieving an overall accuracy of 98.48%. This outstanding performance confirms the model\u2019s effectiveness in accurately diagnosing PV system conditions, further validating its robustness and reliability in fault detection and classification."

The authors introduce QC\u2010PCSANN\u2010CHIO\u2010FD, a novel approach that enhances fault detection in electrical power systems by combining quantum computing, deep learning, and optimisation algorithms. The network, based on a Pyramidal Convolution Shuffle Attention Neural Network (PCSANN) optimised with the Coronavirus Herd Immunity Optimiser, shows promising results. Initially, historical datasets are used for fault detection. Preprocessing, which includes handling missing data and outliers using Adaptive Variational Bayesian Filtering is followed by Dual\u2010Domain Feature Extraction to extract grayscale statistical features. These features are processed by PCSANN to detect faults. The Coronavirus Herd Immunity Optimisation Algorithm is proposed to optimise PCSANN for precise fault detection. Performance of the proposed QC\u2010PCSANN\u2010CHIO\u2010FD approach attains 24.11%, 28.56% and 22.73% high specificity, 21.89%, 23.04% and 9.51% lower computation Time, 25.289%, 15.35% and 19.91% higher ROC and 8.65%, 13.8%, and 7.15% higher Accuracy compared with existing methods, such as combining deep learning based on quantum computing for electrical power system malfunction diagnosis (QC\u2010ANN\u2010FD), electrical power system fault diagnostics using hybrid quantum\u2010classical deep learning (QC\u2010CRBM\u2010FD), applications of machine learning to the identification of power system faults: Recent developments and future directions (QC\u2010RF\u2010FD)."

      "abstract": "Belt conveyor systems are essential in industries like automotive, aerospace, power generation, and heavy machinery, with idlers playing a crucial role in ensuring the smooth movement of materials. However, constant operation in noisy environments accelerates wear and tear on idlers and obscures early signs of malfunction, such as grinding or rattling from loose parts. This challenge makes early fault detection difficult, increasing downtime and maintenance costs. Therefore, timely and accurate fault detection is vital to prevent severe system issues, ensure optimal performance, and avoid unexpected breakdowns and costly production interruptions. Intelligent fault detection (IFD) using artificial intelligence (AI) methods has emerged as a solution, with machine learning techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) proving effective. This study uses Yet another Audio Mobilenet Network (YAMNet), initially designed for sound event detection (SED), to identify faults in belt conveyor idlers by analyzing their unique acoustic signatures. We enhance detection capabilities by extracting temporal features from YAMNet-generated embeddings using bidirectional long-term memory (BiLSTM) and bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRUs), augmented with a soft attention mechanism. These features are evaluated using extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), achieving an impressive 90% accuracy in fault detection across idler test sets. Our approach was rigorously compared to the VGGish model and validated on the publicly available malfunctioning industrial machine investigation and inspection (MIMII) dataset, where it demonstrated superior performance with AUC scores of 0.8355 for fans, 0.9414 for pumps, 0.9265 for valves, and 0.9703 for sliders. These results significantly improve over baseline scores, with increases of 19.36% for fans, 38.44% for pumps, 67.26% for valves, and 38.61% for sliders. This advancement represents a significant step forward in conveyor system diagnostics, providing a robust solution for enhancing industrial safety and operational efficiency."

      "abstract": "Offshore oil platforms represent some of the most challenging operational environments in the world, where electrical power grids are the lifeline for critical functions such as drilling, production, safety systems, and crew support. These isolated microgrids must maintain exceptional reliability amidst harsh marine conditions\u2014saltwater corrosion, extreme weather, and high humidity\u2014while facing logistical constraints like limited maintenance access and the absence of external power backups. Electrical faults in these settings, such as cable insulation failures, circuit overloads, and power fluctuations, pose severe risks: production downtime costing millions of dollars per day, environmental disasters like oil spills, and safety hazards that threaten human lives. Traditional fault management approaches\u2014reliant on scheduled maintenance, manual inspections, and reactive troubleshooting\u2014fall short in these high-stakes conditions. They often fail to detect incipient faults early enough to prevent escalation, depend heavily on scarce human expertise, and expose personnel to hazardous interventions. This research introduces a groundbreaking AI-driven fault detection model designed to autonomously troubleshoot electrical power grids on offshore oil platforms, integrating deep learning, IoT sensor networks, self-healing mechanisms, and reinforcement learning to deliver a robust, proactive solution tailored to these unique challenges. The cornerstone of this framework is the use of deep learning models to achieve early detection of critical electrical anomalies. Cable insulation failures, a prevalent issue due to saltwater exposure and mechanical stress, are identified using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that analyze high-frequency waveform data sampled at 25.6 kHz. Trained on a dataset of 127,500 labeled samples, including both normal and faulted conditions, the CNN achieves a detection accuracy of 98.2%, identifying degradation up to 62.8 days before critical failure\u2014over eight times earlier than conventional methods. Circuit overloads, driven by variable loads from drilling and processing equipment, are predicted using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which process multi-sensor time-series data to forecast overload conditions with a mean squared error of 0.002 and an average lead time of 4.3 hours. Power fluctuations, often caused by generator instability or harmonic distortions, are detected by a hybrid CNN-LSTM model with 97.3% accuracy, enabling proactive adjustments to mitigate equipment damage and maintain power quality. These models collectively transform fault detection from a reactive process to a predictive one, offering substantial lead times for planned interventions and reducing reliance on emergency repairs. Beyond detection, the system incorporates self-healing electrical grids powered by AI-driven automated rerouting mechanisms. A reinforcement learning (RL) agent, implemented with a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN), models the grid as a multi-agent environment where components like generators, switchgear, and transformers are nodes with dynamic states. Trained in a high-fidelity digital twin simulating real-world fault scenarios, the agent learns optimal switching sequences to isolate faults and reroute power in just 120 milliseconds\u2014over 100 times faster than traditional automated systems and dramatically outpacing manual responses averaging 12.7 minutes. During a 12-month pilot on a North Sea oil platform, this self-healing system mitigated 37 potential disruption events, reducing mean time to resolution by 68% (from 8.2 seconds with conventional automation to 3.1 seconds) and boosting critical load availability from 99.92% to 99.98%. By prioritizing safety-critical loads and balancing generator output, it minimized production interruptions, achieving zero electrical-related shutdowns compared to three in the prior year. This autonomous capability not only enhances grid stability but also reduces personnel exposure to hazardous troubleshooting tasks. IoT-based fault localization forms another critical pillar, enabling precise predictive diagnostics through a network of 867 ruggedized sensors deployed across the platform\u2019s electrical infrastructure. These sensors\u2014measuring voltage, current, temperature, partial discharge, vibration, and environmental factors\u2014are designed to IP68 standards for durability in offshore conditions. Edge computing nodes preprocess data with wavelet denoising and adaptive sampling, reducing bandwidth demands while providing high-resolution insights during anomalies. The system achieves a fault localization accuracy of 0.9 meters\u2014a 23-fold improvement over the 20.8-meter average of traditional methods\u2014using a fusion of traveling wave analysis (pinpointing faults within \u00b12 meters) and impedance-based techniques. Predictive diagnostics extend this capability, with component health models estimating remaining useful life and identifying failure modes with 87.6% accuracy, based on trends like gradual insulation degradation or overheating. In practice, this precision cut average repair time by 63.2% (from 8.7 to 3.2 hours) and shifted the planned-to-emergency maintenance ratio from 1.8:1 to 7.3:1, empowering crews with actionable insights to address issues before they escalate. Reinforcement learning further enhances grid resilience, adapting to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of offshore operations. A Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm optimizes protection settings, load shedding, and preemptive control actions within a simulation environment reflecting real platform data and fault histories. The RL framework improves robustness by 38.1% (from 6.3 to 8.7 on a 10-point scale), accelerates recovery by 76.3% (from 17.3 to 4.1 minutes), and boosts overall resilience by 61.1%. It anticipates cascading failures, leverages redundancy (utilization up from 64.2% to 93.6%), and adjusts strategies based on environmental stressors like temperature spikes or humidity surges. Integration with a digital twin synchronizes real-time data, enabling operators to visualize fault locations, simulate interventions, and preserve institutional knowledge\u2014an invaluable asset as experienced personnel retire. Field deployment validated these advancements: fault detection time dropped by 87% (from hours to minutes), downtime decreased by 73% (from 27.3 to 7.4 hours annually), and grid reliability rose by 64% (SAIFI from 4.8 to 1.7 interruptions per year). Economically, the system delivered a net annual benefit of $5.24 million per platform, with a 551% return on investment, driven by $3.75 million in avoided production losses and $1.23 million in maintenance savings. Safety benefits were equally profound, with electrical incidents falling 78.4% (from 3.7 to 0.8 per year) and personnel exposure hours reduced by 76.7% (from 1,872 to 437 annually). Challenges include sensor reliability (3.2% failure rate in harsh conditions), limited historical fault data for rare events, and cybersecurity risks from expanded connectivity, necessitating robust encryption and anomaly detection. This AI-driven model integrates deep learning, IoT, reinforcement learning, and smart grid technologies into a cohesive, autonomous solution, addressing the offshore industry\u2019s pressing needs for safety, reliability, and efficiency. It offers a scalable framework with potential applications in other high-risk infrastructures, setting a new standard for power grid management in extreme environments."

      "abstract": "Gearboxes are autonomous devices essential for power transmission in various mechanical systems. When a failure occurs, it can lead to an inability to perform the required functions, potentially resulting in a complete shutdown of the mechanism and causing significant operational disruptions. Consequently, deploying expert methods for fault detection and diagnosis is crucial to ensuring the reliability and efficiency of these systems. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques show promise for fault diagnosis, but their accuracy can be hindered by noise and manufacturing imperfections that distort mechanical signatures. Thorough data analysis and preprocessing are vital to preserving these critical features. Validating approaches through numerical simulations before experimentation is essential to identify model limitations and minimize risks. A hybrid approach, combining AI and physics-based models, could provide a robust solution by leveraging the strengths of both domains: AI for its ability to process large volumes of data and physics-based models for their reliability in modeling complex mechanical behaviors. This paper proposes a comprehensive diagnostic methodology. It starts with feature extraction from time-domain analysis, which helps identify critical indicators of gearbox performance. Following this, a feature selection process is applied using the Fisher criterion, which ensures that only the most relevant features are retained for further analysis. These selected features are then employed to train an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), a sophisticated approach that combines the learning capabilities of neural networks with the reasoning abilities of fuzzy logic. The proposed methodology is evaluated using a dataset of gear faults generated through energy simulations based on a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) model, followed by a secondary validation on an experimental dataset."

A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) ANN, optimised with 10 hidden layers and the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, achieved near-perfect regression (correlation coefficient R > 0.999 ) and classification accuracy (\u224899%) using 9,180 operational samples, validated against IEEE-compliant transient stability indices (Si) and dynamic voltage margins (DVm). Comparatively, SVMs demonstrated ~95\u201398% accuracy with sub-5 \u00a0inference times, using pre-engineered features (such as harmonic distortions and wavelet coefficients) for real-time efficiency in resource-constrained environments. The study proposed a hybrid ANN-SVM framework, combining SVM\u2019s rapid fault detection with ANN\u2019s precision for post-event diagnostics, addressing the speed-accuracy trade-off in dynamic grids. Engineering implications highlight enhanced grid resilience, cost-effective deployment strategies, and support for renewable integration. At the same time, contributions include empirical validation of AI models in sparse-data contexts and methodological benchmarks aligning machine learning with power quality standards. Recommendations advocated phased AI adoption, workforce training, and regulatory standardisation, with future research directions spanning hardware-in-the-loop validation, cybersecurity, and adaptive learning for renewable-rich grids. This work bridges theoretical AI advancements with practical power system needs, offering scalable solutions for global energy transitions."

      "abstract": "In the dynamic energy sphere in the U.S., operational dependability of gas turbine engines becomes vital to the continuous power production and sustenance of the national grid. Peak and baseload power production, the mainstay of gas turbines, is exposed to high thermal, mechanical, and chemical stresses that lead to wear out of components over time. Traditionally, maintenance practices have either been reactive or time-based, based upon fixed intervals, which has led to premature replacement of components, or vice versa, undetected degradation leading to catastrophic failure. Such approaches carry high operating costs, lower turbine availability, and jeopardize plant safety. The central objective of this research is to build and test an AI-driven fault detection system to identify early signs of failure in gas turbine engines and apply it specifically to deployment within the energy sector of the U.S. Improving gas turbine performance is essential to raising the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of power production systems. The dataset used in this research entails high-resolution operational parameters gathered from different industrial gas turbines operating within U.S. energy facilities. Engine operational data includes multiple time-dependent measurements that monitor essential parameters like turbine temperature at the inlet and outlet and rotational speed, torque measurements alongside vibration levels and power output, fuel rate and intake pressure, and exhaust temperature and oil temperature. Real-time data acquisition from embedded sensor arrays allowed researchers to track turbine performance throughout changing operational states at sub-minute data points. A centralized time-stamping system maintains channel synchronization, thus allowing analysts to draw accurate conclusions about operational states throughout the recorded period. To support strong and interpretable fault detection, we utilized a variety of machine learning models, each chosen for its specific strength at discriminating operations from fault conditions in gas turbines. We used a multi-metric-based evaluation approach that combined statistical validity with operational applicability to assess each model's fault detection capability. Logistic Regression attained the highest accuracy, followed very closely by Random Forest. XG-Boost attained the lowest accuracy of all three algorithms. The use of AI-driven fault detection under predictive maintenance has the potential to revolutionize U.S. power plants using gas turbines as the primary source of electricity generation. In the fiercely competitive and heavily regulated environment of the U.S. energy industry, fault anticipation presents the key to competitive advantage. Using AI-based diagnostics reduces manual checks and simplifies the servicing process by prioritizing technician resources to confirmed at-risk components. AI-powered fault detection is critical to improving grid resilience within the U.S. energy infrastructure by assuring that peak-demand-balancing and grid-stabilizing gas turbines remain fault-free."

      "abstract": "The global shift toward renewable energy, particularly wind power, underscores the critical need for advanced fault diagnosis systems to optimize wind turbine reliability and efficiency. While traditional diagnostic methods remain foundational, their limitations in addressing the nonlinear dynamics and operational complexity of modern turbines have accelerated the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven approaches. This review systematically examines advancements in AI-based fault diagnosis techniques, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), from 2019 to 2024, analyzing their evolution, efficacy, and practical challenges. Drawing on a curated selection of 55 studies (identified via structured searches across IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science), the paper prioritizes research employing data-driven or model-based methodologies with explicit experimental validation and clearly documented data sources. The excluded works lacked English accessibility, validation, or data transparency. Focusing on high-impact faults in gearboxes, blades, and generators, these components are responsible for over 70% of turbine failures, the review maps prevalent ML and DL algorithms, such as CNNs, LSTMs, and SVMs, to specific fault types, revealing hybrid AI models and real-world data integration as key drivers of diagnostic accuracy. Critical gaps are identified, including overreliance on simulated datasets and inconsistent signal preprocessing, which hinder real-world applicability. This study concludes with actionable recommendations for future research, advocating adaptive noise-filtering techniques, scalable hybrid architectures, and standardized benchmarking using operational turbine data. By bridging theoretical AI advancements with practical deployment challenges, this work aims to inform next-generation fault diagnosis systems, enhancing turbine longevity and supporting global renewable energy goals."

      "abstract": "Due to its high sensitivity to small amounts of electrical faults, dissolved gas analysis (DGA) is a popular method for identifying faults in power transformers. The early prediction of fault type in transformers is a crucial part of power system reliability. As a result of this, it is extremely essential to keep a close eye on the behaviour of the power transformer while in service. Periodic monitoring of the condition of power transformers is important to prevent power outages. Early fault detection can result in substantial operational and maintenance cost savings, as well as the prevention of any early breakdown or failure. The current research study aims to assist experts in precisely diagnosing power transformer faults by providing an alternative to the drawbacks that classical DGA methods viz. Dornensburg ratio, Rogers' ratio, IEC ratio, and Key gas possess i.e., the lack of a proper diagnosis for instances that do not fall under the usual DGA codes. This work proposes an artificial intelligence (AI)-based fault diagnoses algorithm, which is a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for improving the diagnostic accuracy of existing DGA methods. According to the author's knowledge, there are no existing research works that have developed an SVM-based fault classification approach using Google Colab. As a result, the proposed work contributes to the fault diagnostics of power transformers. The results presented in this research showed that the proposed method SVM has high accuracy in diagnosing faults in power transformers as compared to the four methods presented."

      "abstract": "Real-world automated systems such as building automation, power plants, and more have benefited from data-driven learning methodologies for anomaly detection and diagnosis. Typically, these methodologies heavily rely on prior knowledge related to abnormal operations, i.e., data points labeled as anomalies. However, in practice, such labelled data points are often unavailable which poses challenges in effective anomaly detection, particularly in diagnosis. In this paper, we propose One-class Classification Cluster ENsembles ( OCCEN ) anomaly detection and diagnosis approach for multivariate time series data. OCCEN utilizes one-class classification learning methods for anomaly detection followed by the decomposition of anomalies into multiple clusters. Then each cluster is treated as a binary classification problem and classifiers are trained to learn cluster representations. These trained models in combination with explainable AI models are used to generate a ranked list of diagnoses, i.e., features. Finally, we re-rank those features to account for temporal dependencies through the dynamic time-warping technique. The practical evaluation of OCCEN for air handling units (AHU) demonstrates its effectiveness in identifying faults. The framework consistently outperforms the baseline in fault diagnosis, as higher scores are observed for detection and diagnostic evaluation metrics, including F1 score, intersection over union, HitRate@ k , and RootCause@ k ."

      "abstract": "Global efforts to address climate change have intensified the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, positioning wind power as a critical player due to its advanced technology, scalability, and environmental benefits. Despite their potential, the reliability of wind turbines, particularly their gearboxes, remains a persistent challenge. Gearbox failures lead to significant downtime, high maintenance costs, and reduced operational efficiency, threatening the economic competitiveness of wind energy. This study proposes an innovative condition monitoring model for wind turbine gearboxes, utilizing Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems and Deep Learning techniques. The model analyzes historical operating data from wind turbine to classify gearbox conditions into normal and abnormal states. Optimizing the dataset for deep neural networks through advanced data processing methods achieves an impressive fault detection accuracy of 98.8%. Designed for seamless integration into real-time monitoring systems, this approach enables early fault prediction and supports proactive maintenance strategies. By enhancing gearbox reliability, reducing unplanned downtime, and lowering maintenance expenses, the model improves the overall economic viability of wind farms. This advancement reinforces wind energy\u2019s pivotal role in driving a sustainable, low-carbon future, aligning with global climate goals and renewable energy adoption."

      "abstract": "Pneumatic-hydraulic actuated ball valves are critical components in pipeline rupture protection and emergency shutdown systems for large-diameter natural gas transmission pipelines. Traditional maintenance methods, relying on periodic inspections and reactive maintenance, often result in delayed fault detection, which increases safety risks. In order to address this challenge, this study proposes an innovative intelligent fault diagnosis approach that significantly enhances early fault detection and predictive maintenance without requiring structural modifications to the valve. The main contributions of this work are: 1) the development of a novel time-frequency analysis-based feature extraction method for current and pressure signals, which improves fault signature reliability and distinguishes fault patterns more effectively; and 2) the application of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks optimized using an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm, achieving 100% diagnostic accuracy for both solenoid valve and mechanical faults. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach, with field tests successfully detecting torque anomalies and identifying risks related to solenoid valve power-off logic. This approach provides a robust solution for transitioning from preventive to predictive maintenance, significantly improving operational safety and pipeline reliability."
