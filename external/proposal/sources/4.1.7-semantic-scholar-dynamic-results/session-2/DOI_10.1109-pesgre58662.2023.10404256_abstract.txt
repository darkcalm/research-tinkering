Predictive maintenance of component (or equipment) in renewable energy systems are crucial as malfunction of one of the components (or equipment) can lead to power fluctuations, reduced performance, expensive downtime, failure of part of the system or the whole system, and even catastrophic failures. Massive amount of data is continuously generated by PV monitoring systems. The data can be used for diagnostics (fault detection and identification) and prognostics using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). The ML models can take the benefit of context available in the domain and acquired along with the data. This paper attempts to leverage context information towards developing a Recurrent Neural Network based model for fault detection in photovoltaic systems. We compared the performance of the proposed context sensitive model with baseline model using real dataset and obtained better results in terms of accuracy, true positive rate, and false positive rate.
