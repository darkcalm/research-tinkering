      "abstract": "Given the advance of the Smart Grid technology, the electrical grid is now in a process of transformation never seen in history. This new grid model allows customers and providers to generate and manage electrical power efficiently. To support such transformation, a key element of the model is the communication network responsible for delivering measurement data from sensors on the grid to the applications that analyze and adapt distribution according to demands. This work proposes and evaluates a system architecture that copes with reliability and latency demands that are of much importance for a successful Smart Grid deployment, also considering the internal design of distributed applications in the context of Smart Grids. The architecture adopts a Mobile Edge Computing based infrastructure that is suitable for 4G and 5G mobile cellular networks. Experiments made on NS-3 shows that the proposed system architecture is capable of handling a realistic number of smart meters while providing low latency and network reliability, supporting many use cases of a Smart Grid deployment."

In this paper, we consider one of the key operations for smart grid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reliability, which is situational awareness and discuss the role that the edge computing can play to enhance this operation by providing distributed state estimation (DSE) locally at the edge nodes. We specifically focus on the network of the phasor measurement units (PMUs) as an example of the industrial internet of things in smart grids and discuss the edge-computing platform architecture to enable data analytics for DSE using the PMU time-series. We discuss that it is important to consider the physics of the smart grid in designing the edge-computing layer. As an example, we present a data-driven method for detecting power line trips using the PMU data and the designed physics-aware edge-computing platform."

      "abstract": "The explosive development of electrical engineering in the early 19th century marked the birth of the 2nd industrial revolution, with the use of electrical energy in place of steam power, as well as changing the history of human development. The versatility of electricity allows people to apply it to a multitude of fields such as transportation, heat applications, lighting, telecommunications, and computers. Nowadays, with the breakout development of science and technology, electric energy sources are formed by many different technologies such as hydroelectricity, solar power, wind power, coal power, etc. These energy sources are connected to form grid systems to transmit electricity to cities, businesses and homes for life and work. Electrical energy today has become the backbone of all modern technologies. To ensure the safe, reliable and energy-efficient operation of the grid, a wide range of grid management applications have been proposed. However, a significant challenge for monitoring and controlling grids is service response time. In recent times, to solve this problem, smart grid management applications based on IoT and edge computing have been proposed. In this work, we perform a comprehensive survey of edge computing for IoT-enabled smart grid systems. In addition, recent smart grid frameworks based on IoT and edge computing are discussed, important requirements are presented, and the open issues and challenges are indicated. We believe that in the Internet of Things era, the smart grid will be the future of energy. We hope that these study results will contribute important guidelines for in-depth research in the field of smart grids and green energy in the future."

Edge computing decentralizes the IT infrastructure in multiple edge data centers (EDCs) across the access networks to reduce latency and network congestion. Edge computing can benefit significantly from different aspects of smart grids to achieve lower energy consumption and greater resilience to electricity price fluctuations. This paper presents a modeling, simulation, and optimization (M&S&O) framework for analyzing and dimensioning smart grid-aware edge computing federations. This tool integrates aspects of a consumer-centric smart grid model to the resource management policies of the EDCs. To illustrate the benefits of this tool, we show a realistic case study for optimizing the energy consumption and operational expenses of an edge computing federation that provides service to a driver assistance IoT application. Results show that this approach can reduce the daily energy consumption by 20.3% and the electricity budget by 30.3%."

However, in order to satisfy customers, applications like intelligent transportation systems, smart grids, smart cities, and healthcare call for even more effective services. This survey addresses extensive research on two aspects: firstly, we present the advancements of two application domains namely maritime areas and aerial systems in terms of integration with EC architecture. Secondly, we cover the most recent technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain, combined into the EC paradigm by discussing several experiments conducted in various fields to demonstrate the value of utilizing them in the edge computing architecture. We analyze the results of eleven experiments in each technology from 2015 to 2023."

      "abstract": "This paper focuses on the integration of edge computing in smart sensor networks. In Internet of Things (IoT) applications, traditional cloud computing models cause data processing delays due to long-distance data transmission. This transmission delay significantly impairs real-time data processing and feedback capabilities, particularly in time-sensitive applications. Edge computing can transfer data to local devices for processing so that data that is affected by network congestion does not have to be transmitted long distances to the cloud for processing. It can greatly reduce the delay caused by network congestion and reduce energy consumption. In addition, it also provides certain guarantees for data security. Building upon these characteristics, edge computing offers several key advantages. First, it enables efficient local data processing for real-time operation. In some industrial applications such as smart grids and intelligent transportation systems, edge computing can operate highly autonomously. This avoids the delay caused by network fluctuations when transmitting to the cloud. This paper explores the integration of lightweight machine learning models, particularly TinyML, in edge computing applications. These models will improve the data processing capabilities of edge devices. Finally, the article also proposes further ideas for this new architecture to make up for the shortcomings of the architecture in task allocation and data processing."

      "abstract": "As urbanization accelerates, smart cities are emerging as innovative ecosystems that integrate technology to address challenges related to sustainability, mobility, and infrastructure. Among these technologies, edge computing has gained prominence as a transformative solution to optimize data processing and resource management in urban environments. This paper explores the role of edge computing in enabling efficient, real-time decision-making by bringing computational power closer to data sources. Unlike traditional cloud-centric models, edge computing reduces latency, enhances data security, and improves bandwidth utilization by distributing data processing across decentralized nodes. The integration of edge computing in smart cities supports various applications, including intelligent transportation systems, energy-efficient smart grids, and real-time public safety monitoring. By processing data locally, edge devices can handle massive volumes of information generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices, ensuring seamless service delivery without overwhelming centralized systems. Furthermore, this decentralized approach enhances resilience by reducing dependency on remote servers, a crucial factor for mission-critical urban applications. A significant focus of this paper is on resource management, particularly the allocation of computational resources across edge nodes. Strategies such as dynamic resource scheduling, load balancing, and adaptive task offloading are analyzed for their effectiveness in maintaining operational efficiency. Moreover, the research highlights the importance of leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms within edge computing frameworks to predict traffic patterns, optimize energy consumption, and enhance waste management systems. Security and privacy concerns, often considered barriers to edge computing adoption, are addressed through advanced encryption techniques and secure communication protocols. This paper also evaluates challenges associated with edge computing deployment, such as hardware limitations, interoperability issues, and the need for robust regulatory frameworks. Case studies from leading smart city projects illustrate successful implementations and offer insights into overcoming these obstacles. In addition to technical aspects, this research underscores the socioeconomic benefits of edge computing in urban settings. Improved public services, reduced environmental impact, and cost-effective infrastructure management demonstrate the potential of edge computing to revolutionize city living. By enabling real-time analytics and localized decision-making, edge computing supports a more responsive and adaptive urban ecosystem. The findings presented in this paper emphasize the critical role of edge computing in bridging the gap between urban challenges and technological solutions. As cities continue to evolve, adopting edge computing technologies will not only enhance operational efficiency but also foster innovation, sustainability, and inclusivity. Future research directions include exploring hybrid models combining edge and cloud computing, advancing hardware capabilities, and developing standardized frameworks to accelerate adoption. This paper contributes to the growing body of knowledge on edge computing, offering a comprehensive analysis of its applications, challenges, and potential in shaping the future of smart cities. By optimizing data processing and resource management, edge computing emerges as a cornerstone technology for creating smarter, more resilient urban environments."

      "abstract": "Edge computing, as an extension of cloud computing, brings computation and data storage closer to the data source. This shift offers significant advantages in terms of latency reduction, bandwidth optimization, and real-time processing capabilities. By minimizing the distance that data needs to travel, edge computing enhances the performance of applications that require rapid data processing and immediate response times. This is particularly beneficial for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, autonomous vehicles, smart grids, and other applications that demand low-latency interactions. However, the decentralization inherent in edge computing introduces a unique set of cybersecurity challenges that are distinct from those faced in traditional centralized cloud environments. The distributed architecture of edge computing creates numerous points of vulnerability, each of which can be exploited by cyber attackers. Additionally, edge devices often operate with limited computational resources and power, which complicates the implementation of robust security measures. This paper explores the cybersecurity implications of edge computing in the context of data engineering. It begins with a comprehensive review of existing literature to establish the current understanding of edge computing security issues. The review identifies the primary vulnerabilities associated with edge computing, including those related to distributed architecture, data transmission, and resource constraints. Following the literature review, the paper delves into specific security threats that edge computing environments face. These include man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, malware and ransomware, and insider threats. Each threat is analyzed to understand its potential impact on edge computing systems and the data they process."

      "abstract": "Smart grid and cloud computing architectures have been perfectly suiting each other naturally. As a result, over the years cloud computing architectures have dominated the implementations of smart grid applications to address computing needs. However, due to continuing additions of heterogeneous (sensing and actuating) devices, emergence of Internet of Things (IoT), and massive amount of data collected across the grids for analytics, have contributed to the complexity of smart grids, making cloud computing architectures no longer suitable to provide smart grid services effectively. Edge and Fog computing approaches have relieved the cloud computing architectures of problems related to network congestion, latency and locality by shift of control, intelligence and trust to the edge of the network. In this paper, a systematic literature review is used to explore the research trend of the actual implementations of edge and fog computing for smart grid applications. A total of 70 papers were reviewed from the popular digital repositories. The study has revealed that, there is significant increase in the number of smart grid applications that have exploited the use edge and fog computing approaches. The study also shows that, considerable number of the smart grid applications are related to energy optimizations and intelligent coordination of smart grid resources. There are also challenges and issues that hinder smooth adoption of edge and fog computing for smart grid applications, which include security, interoperability and programming models."

However, challenges related to latency, privacy,\nand bandwidth have arisen due to the massive influx of data generated by IoT devices and the limitations of\ntraditional cloud-based architectures. Moreover, network management, interoperability, security, and scalability\nissues have emerged due to the rapid growth and heterogeneous nature of IoT devices. To overcome such\nproblems, researchers proposed a new architecture called Software Defined Networking for Edge Computing in the\nInternet of Things (SDN-EC-IoT), which combines Edge Computing for the Internet of Things (EC-IoT) and\nSoftware Defined Internet of Things (SDIoT). Although researchers have studied EC-IoT and SDIoT as individual\narchitectures, they have not yet addressed the combination of both, creating a significant gap in our understanding\nof SDN-EC-IoT. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive review of how the SDN-EC-IoT\nparadigm can solve IoT challenges. To achieve this goal, this study conducted a literature review covering 74\narticles published between 2019 and 2023. Finally, this paper identifies future research directions for SDN-EC-IoT,\nincluding the development of interoperability platforms, scalable architectures, low latency and Quality of Service\n(QoS) guarantees, efficient handling of big data, enhanced security and privacy, optimized energy consumption,\nresource-aware task offloading, and incorporation of machine learning."

      "abstract": "Green-powered edge computing architectures allow bringing computation in areas that are not reached by the power grids. More often, in applications for Precision Agriculture and Smart Cities, we could have a set of nodes that are coupled with an accumulator which is, during the day, re-charged by the energy harvested by small solar panels. With the latest advances in technology, the edge node is generally assimilated to be a low-power Single Board Computer (SBC), and it is able to carry out even relatively demanding tasks. For example, it can run deep learning models to images or video sequences captured in loco by cameras. However, due to the differences in terms of power consumption and weather conditions, each node experiences a different lifespan, some nodes may even shut down prematurely, causing the interruption of the portion of the deployed service. In this paper, we propose three decentralized algorithms that solve the problem by making the nodes cooperatively balance the traffic in order to level and maximize their lifespan. By comparing the approaches in two different experiments by using a cluster of Raspberry Pi 4 we show that our solutions allow to increase the lifespan of the service of 10% on average wrt the case in which no algorithm is applied."

      "abstract": "Recent advances in distributed data processing and machine learning provide new opportunities to enable critical, time-sensitive functionalities of smart distribution grids in a secure and reliable fashion. Combining the recent advents of edge computing (EC) and edge intelligence (EI) with existing advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) has the potential to reduce overall communication cost, preserve user privacy, and provide improved situational awareness. In this paper, we provide an overview for how EC and EI can supplement applications relevant to AMI systems. Additionally, using such systems in tandem can enable distributed deep learning frameworks (e.g., federated learning) to empower distributed data processing and intelligent decision making for AMI. Finally, to demonstrate the efficacy of this considered architecture, we approach the non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) problem using federated learning to train a deep recurrent neural network architecture in a 2-tier and 3-tier manner. In this approach, smart homes locally train a neural network using their metering data and only share the learned model parameters with AMI components for aggregation. Our results show this can reduce communication cost associated with distributed learning, as well as provide an immediate layer of privacy, due to no raw data being communicated to AMI components. Further, we show that FL is able to closely match the model loss provided by standard centralized deep learning where raw data is communicated for centralized training."
