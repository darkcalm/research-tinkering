      "abstract": "This paper aims to establish a virtual object management system, as well as optimal task scheduling using the foundation of Digital Twins (DT), to improve the user\u2019s experience with management and to accomplish the task efficiently. On the other hand, offloading tasks using IoT gadgets to edge computing, fails to speed up control by users. The capabilities of the DT are provided by executing processes such as visualization, virtualization, synchronization, and simulation. The optimal selection of the virtual objects for the DT is done by utilizing the implemented Hybrid Energy Valley with L\u00e9vy Flight Distribution Optimization (HEV-LFDO) in order to optimally offload the task by the edge devices. The optimal selection of the virtual objects is done with the aid of the HEV-LFDO in the DT by considering the total cost of executing all tasks using the selected virtual objects and the decision variables to determine whether a virtual object is taken for executing a task or not as the constraint. The data for performing resource management is secured using the blockchain or distributed ledger technology. This accounts for the minimization of the local loss function. Finally, the secured data is considered for optimal resource management tasks. The optimal resource management is done using the same HEV-LFDO. This optimal resource management is carried out by considering the constraints like the cost of assigning a virtual object for the task to the edge device, and the cost of assigning the task to the edge device. These two costs are analyzed by taking the network\u2019s bandwidth, energy consumption, and computational resources into consideration. Experimental verifications are conducted on the executed optimal resource management scheme to prove the ability of the implemented model to be integrated with the edge computing network. The overall processing time as well as the latency are also minimized by executing the optimal resource management scheme."

      "abstract": "Blockchain, which is at the heart of bitcoin and other digital currencies, is a game-changing technology, particularly in the stock market and financial technology. These characteristics make blockchain adoption appealing for enhancing information security, privacy and reliability in a variety of scenarios. This article develops the trust with reputation-based management for the financial stock market. Here distributed ledger technology (DLT) has been integrated for implementing the ledger in which data is stored across a network of decentralized nodes. By this, proof-based ledger has been maintained with transparency, traceability and security. DLT here used is based on trust design in mitigating the malicious activities of the financial stock marketing technology. Then using Bayesian theory based on the fault tolerance (BDLT_FT) model has been used in improving the efficiency of DLT and financial technology. This acts as the protocol which reduces energy consumption and enhance network scalability and security in digital transactions like cryptocurrency The financial data related to blockchain cryptocurrency were collected between the time period 2000 and 2020. The dataset of the stock market is evaluated under the fault tolerance model with statistical analysis. The statistical evaluation of financial data with developed BDLT_FT expressed that there is no association between the fault tolerance and the classification error."

      "abstract": "\n The Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) project lifecycle consists of multiple organizations, private and public, that work together to carry out the licensing and regulation, commissioning, construction, supply chain management, decommissioning, and non-proliferation of nuclear power plants. Each stage of the lifecycle generates a considerable amount of documentation that needs to be archived and made available on request. In this paper, we examined the current frameworks employed by the stakeholders of nuclear power plant lifecycles for data generation, classification, archival, and exchange and we evaluated the use of distributed ledger technology for data management. We further demonstrated the implementation of distributed ledger technology to capturing and immutable recording nuclear supply chain structure, production, and failure data.\n Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) promises to address the current bottlenecks in the lifecycle management of nuclear power plants with faster data exchange times, lower processing cost of documents, bridging the gap between perceived and actual risk, faster decisions, customizable transparency in job tasks being executed, improved cash flow, instant validation of job completion, reduction in logistical friction, and sped up supply chain decisions for clients. We gave a comprehensive review of distributed ledger technology, its properties and an open-source permissioned distributed ledger system called Hyperledger Fabric.\n Each sector of the nuclear power plant lifecycle was analyzed for data management bottlenecks and building on our discussion of employing distributed ledger technology we discussed the pathway in which Hyperledger Fabric can be employed to address the data management bottlenecks in each stage of the lifecycle including, licensing and regulation, commissioning, construction, supply chain management, decommissioning, and non-proliferation."

It addresses the challenges of ensuring data exchange in a simple, scalable, and affordable way. The communication platform for data exchange is using Ethereum Blockchain technology. It provides a distributed ledger database across a distributed network, supports simple connectivity for new stakeholders, and enables many small entities to contribute with their flexible energy to the system balancing. The architecture of a simulation/emulation environment provides a direct connection of a relational database to the Ethereum network, thus enabling dynamic data management. In addition, it extends security of the environment with security mechanisms of relational databases. Proof-of-concept setup with the simulation of system balancing processes, confirms the suitability of the solution for secure data exchange in the market, operation, and measurement area. For the most intensive and space-consuming measurement data exchange, we have investigated data aggregation to ensure performance optimisation of required computation and space usage."

However, organizations manage the environmental data collected by such PMSs in a centralized manner, which is why recorded environmental data are vulnerable to manipulation. Moreover, the analysis of pollution data often lacks transparency to outsiders, which may lead to wrong decisions regarding environmental regulations. To address these challenges, we propose a software design for PMSs based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) and the long-range (LoRa) protocol for flexible, transparent, and energy-efficient environment monitoring and data management. To design the PMS, we conducted a comprehensive requirements analysis for PMSs. We benchmarked different consensus mechanisms (e.g., BFT-SMaRt and Raft) and digital signature schemes (e.g., ECDSA and EdDSA) to adequately design the PMS and fulfill the identified requirements. On this basis, we designed and implemented a prototype PMS and evaluated it in the field. The evaluation shows the effectiveness of DLT-based PMSs that include portable low-energy sensor nodes and demonstrates the applicability of the proposed software design for PMSs in contexts other than air pollution."

      "abstract": "Nowadays, blockchain is developing as a secure and trustworthy platform for secure information sharing in areas of application like banking, supply chain management, food industry, energy, the Internet, and medical services. Besides, the blockchain can be described in a decentralized manner as an immutable ledger for recording data entries. Furthermore, this new technology has been developed to interrupt a variety of data-driven fields, including the health sector. However, blockchain refers to the distributed ledger technology, which constitutes an innovation in the information recording and sharing without a trusted third party. In this paper, blockchain and Distributed Ledger-based Improved Biomedical Security system (BDL-IBS) has been proposed to enhance the privacy and data security across healthcare applications. Further, our goal is to make it possible for patients to use the data to support their care and to provide strong consent systems for sharing data among different organizations and applications, since this includes managing and accessing a high amount of medical information, and this technology can maintain data to ensure reliability. Finally, results show that new blockchain-based digital platforms allow for fast, easy, and seamless interactions between data suppliers to enhance privacy and data security, including for patients themselves."

      "abstract": "Nowadays, it has been recognized that blockchain can provide the technological infrastructure for developing decentralized, secure, and reliable smart energy grid management systems. However, an open issue that slows the adoption of blockchain technology in the energy sector is the low scalability and high processing overhead when dealing with the real-time energy data collected by smart energy meters. Thus, in this paper, we propose a scalable second tier solution which combines the blockchain ledger with distributed queuing systems and NoSQL (Not Only SQL database) databases to allow the registration of energy transactions less frequently on the chain without losing the tamper-evident benefits brought by the blockchain technology. At the same time, we propose a technique for tamper-evident registration of smart meters\u2019 energy data and associated energy transactions using digital fingerprinting which allows the energy transaction to be linked hashed-back on-chain, while the sensors data is stored off-chain. A prototype was implemented using Ethereum and smart contracts for the on-chain components while for the off-chain components we used Cassandra database and RabbitMQ messaging broker. The prototype proved to be effective in managing a settlement of energy imbalances use-case and during the evaluation conducted in simulated environment shows promising results in terms of scalability, throughput, and tampering of energy data sampled by smart energy meters."

An example of DLT is a blockchain where data form blocks in an append-only chain. Software architecture description usually comprises multiple views. The paper concentrates on the Deployment view of the DLT solution within the 1+5 architectural views model. The authors have proposed Unified Modeling Language (UML) extensibility mechanisms to describe the needed additional semantic notation to model deployment details. The paper covers both the network and node levels. The proposed stereotypes and tagged values have enriched the UML Deployment diagram. We have gathered those modeling elements in dedicated UML Profile for Distributed Ledger Deployment. We have applied the profile to model the Deployment view of a renewable energy management system that uses the R3Cordaframework. The system records information about inbound and outbound energy to/from a renewable energy grid."

In terms of management and monitoring, human control factors are high, causing the ecological environment monitoring platform to fall into difficulties such as low data credibility, no traceability, and low security. Distributed ledger technology, as one of the core technologies of the blockchain, can disperse the confirmed data among multiple nodes for simultaneous consensus and give it a timestamp. It ensures the traceability and decentralization of data and avoids the occurrence of data islands and unreliable data during the environmental monitoring process. Combined with the characteristics of distributed ledger technology such as traceability, decentralization, non-tamperability, and openness, we explore its role in the ecological environment monitoring platform from various aspects such as environmental quality monitoring, resource management, behavioral supervision and restraint, and energy usage monitoring. feasibility, and pointed out the risks and challenges faced by distributed ledger technology in the application of ecological environment monitoring platforms.

      "abstract": "Energy shortfall and electricity load shedding are the main problems for developing countries. The main causes are lack of management in the energy sector and the use of non-renewable energy sources. The improved energy management and use of renewable sources can be significant to resolve energy crisis. It is necessary to increase the use of renewable energy sources (RESs) to meet the increasing energy demand due to high prices of fossil-fuel based energy. Federated learning (FL) is the most emerging technique in the field of artificial intelligence. Federated learning helps to generate global model at server side by ensemble locally trained models at remote edges sites while preserving data privacy. The global model used to predict energy demand to satisfy the needs of consumers. In this article, we have proposed Blockchain based safe distributed ledger technology for transaction of data between prosumer and consumer to ensure their transparency, traceability and security. Furthermore, we have also proposed a Federated learning model to forecast the energy requirements of consumer and prosumer. Moreover, Blockchain has been used to store excess energy data from prosumer for better management of energy between prosumer and grid. Lastly, the experiment results revealed that renewable energy sources have produced better and comparable results to other non-renewable energy resources."

      "abstract": "Data breaches, identity theft, and the lack of user control within traditional digital identity management systems, it begs a more secure and decentralized alternative. In this study we propose a blockchain based digital identity management framework that implements privacy, security and transparency by employing distributed ledger technology. To provide tamper proof identity storage and automated verification, the proposed model uses cryptographic hashing and smart contracts. The use of a novel token-based access mechanism enables users to safely share their identity data with third parties, while keeping sensitive information out of sight. Security metrics are enhanced by 30% for data integrity with 45% reduction in unauthorized access attempts all through simulations. The framework also achieves improved efficiency reducing identity verification time by 40 percent compared to traditional systems. It offers a promising approach to address important vulnerabilities in centralized identity management in line with the development of marketable and user-friendly digital identity solutions."

An efficient cluster head selection algorithm is proposed to select the desired cluster head with the consideration of low energy consumption and fast head selection. An enhanced combination of IoT forwarding devices and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technology is further advanced. Furthermore, the proposed \u201cDistBlockBuilding\u201d architecture is implemented for managing a safe and secure data transfer from one surface to another surface. Besides, Blockchain technology is performed for transferring data within the smart building. Finally, the performance of IoT-SDN based secured networks is evaluated."

The proposed platform considers green power transactions across microgrids, bidirectional power and green power charging and discharging transactions in microgrids, demand response bidding, and vehicle-to-vehicle emergency rescue charging. This innovative architecture operates smart contracts and distributed ledgers independently; uses smart contracts to handle bidding, matching, and settlement of the power trading platform; and simultaneously employs the cloud and local distributed ledger nodes to chain the detailed real-time transaction information and power data on the ledger. In this manner, the security and fairness of data can be ensured; furthermore, a large amount of chaining information can be processed, and the chaining latency can be shortened. In addition, the communication protocols are integrated through the artificial intelligence of things. An energy management system (EMS) is proposed, which can perform optimal charging and discharging scheduling according to the power transaction matching results and then control charging piles and energy storage system devices. It can reduce the operating cost of microgrids in commercial buildings, increase the efficiency of green power utilization, and reduce power loss. In this system, power transactions are automatically and simultaneously executed in the EMS to achieve real-time supply and demand balance of regional microgrids."
