        "abstract": "This research elaborates the understanding the pros, cons, and implications of smart meters and renewable energy. Given the increased emphasis on sustainability, especially in the shift to greener energy solutions, smart meters' role in boosting renewable energy resource utilization is vital. Smart meters provide real-time energy production and consumption data important for energy system upgrades. Their accurate energy monitoring encourages greater utilization and energy savings. By combining solar panels and wind turbines, smart meters may minimize fossil fuel use and improve clean energy distribution and consumption. Integrating smart meters with renewable energy is difficult. Efficiency in data management, cybersecurity, and technology interoperability is needed. Poor infrastructure may hinder adoption due to financial and legal constraints. Smart meters on renewable energy sources are promising. Smart meters and decentralized energy system architecture will improve, allowing peer-to-peer energy trading. Community renewable energy utilization may boost energy efficiency and grid resilience, enabling a sustainable energy future. Energy providers, policymakers, and consumers must understand these dynamics."

        "abstract": "Due to an ever\u2010increasing rise in proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs), the paradigm of passive electrical distribution networks is shifting toward active distribution systems. This new environment introduces a plethora of challenges that cannot be managed by traditional tools, whose utilization could compromise the reliability and efficient operation of distribution feeders. This article systematically reviews state of the art in different DERs management software solutions available today. Additionally, it establishes distinguished roles and responsibilities of different levels of hierarchy in distinct solutions that are all commonly called DERs management systems\u2014DERMS (e.g., fully centralized versus fully decentralized DER management solutions). Lastly, it offers a viewpoint on the directions that hold potential for the power system community and industry to explore for further developments of more robust and intelligent DERMS, to successfully enable efficient transition into a new era of clean and sustainable power systems, encompassing active and dynamically changing distribution circuits."

In this paper, we investigate security considerations for an Ethereum blockchain hosting a distributed energy management application. We have simulated a microgrid with ten buildings in the northeast U.S., and results of the transaction distribution and electricity utilization are presented. We also present the effects on energy distribution when one or two smart meters have their identities corrupted. We then propose a new approach to digital identity management that would require smart meters to authenticate with the blockchain ledger and mitigate identity-spoofing attacks. Applications of this approach to defense against port scans and DDoS, attacks are also discussed."

        "abstract": "Power system operation is gaining complexity due to the changes imposed by the energy transition. Especially, the increased share of intermittent and decentralized renewable generation units in the energy mix, an increased uncertainty regarding the supply of energy, and the predominantly market-driven cross-region and cross-border transport of electricity impose new challenges on the operation of power systems in Europe. In particular, power system operators must facilitate higher utilization of the grid capacity and coordinate more with neighboring transmission system operators (TSOs) and distribution system operators (DSOs). To deal with these new challenges, there is a pressing need to improve the observability and controllability of key system parameters to safeguard the reliability of power systems. Furthermore, the aforementioned developments and challenges go hand in hand with the need to improve the system resilience from the cybersecurity and system stability points of view. In the future, these challenges cannot be met without innovation towards intelligent decision support systems and assistant functions, which allow a look ahead combined with fast response and proactive actions. Here, the rather novel digital twin (DT) concept in combination with data-driven (i.e., machine learning) applications can be purposefully applied."

        "abstract": "Escalating energy demands and climate change challenges necessitate the adaptation of renewable-based microgrid systems in the energy sector. The proposed work employs a robust Multi Agent System (MAS) technique to achieve efficient and automated control of the hybrid microgrid operation. The hybrid microgrid system incorporates Renewable Energy Sources (RES), a diesel generator, and a battery storage system. The operation of the hybrid microgrid consists of three distinct modes: islanded, transition to grid, and grid-oriented mode. The system\u2019s performance is optimized by considering factors like climatic patterns, energy costs, connected source characteristics, and load demand. Different climatic scenarios are assessed for each mode of operation, where the best, extreme sunny, extreme cloudy, and worst climate conditions are considered for islanded mode; sunny and cloudy scenarios are considered for transition to grid mode as well as grid-feed and grid-tied modes are considered for grid-oriented operation of the microgrid. The simulation studies are performed using the MATLAB/Simulink R2021a environment. Furthermore, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is implemented to optimize power allocation within the microgrid and enhance its cost-effectiveness. The optimization results demonstrate efficient utilization of available energy sources along with effective energy management facilitated by the MAS control system. The results emphasize the importance of adopting a MAS approach for achieving smart energy management through comprehensive analysis and integrating decentralized energy management techniques for optimal accommodation of distributed energy resources in hybrid microgrids"

        "abstract": "\u2014\u2014 With the rapid integration of distributed energy re\u2010 sources (DERs), distribution utilities are faced with new and un\u2010 precedented issues. New challenges introduced by high penetra\u2010 tion of DERs range from poor observability to overload and re\u2010 verse power flow problems, under-/over-voltages, maloperation of legacy protection systems, and requirements for new plan\u2010 ning procedures. Distribution utility personnel are not adequate\u2010 ly trained, and legacy control centers are not properly equipped to cope with these issues. Fortunately, distribution energy re\u2010 source management systems (DERMSs) are emerging software technologies aimed to provide distribution system operators (DSOs) with a specialized set of tools to enable them to over\u2010 come the issues caused by DERs and to maximize the benefits of the presence of high penetration of these novel resources. However, as DERMS technology is still emerging, its definition is vague and can refer to very different levels of software hier\u2010 archies, spanning from decentralized virtual power plants to DER aggregators and fully centralized enterprise systems (called utility DERMS). Although they are all frequently simply called DERMS, these software technologies have different sets of tools and aim to provide different services to different stake\u2010 holders. This paper explores how these different software tech\u2010 nologies can complement each other, and how they can provide significant benefits to DSOs in enabling them to successfully manage evolving distribution networks with high penetration of DERs when they are integrated together into the control cen\u2010 ters of distribution utilities."

        "abstract": "The necessity for an efficient resource management system during and\n postdisaster is underscored by the prevalent coordination and resource\n management challenges faced by various organizations, including\n non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and government units. To address these\n problems, our system proposal introduces NGO-RMSD, a blockchain-based\n decentralized system designed to enhance collaborative efforts during and\n after disasters. Utilizing the Quorum framework for its energy efficiency,\n NGO-RMSD enables seamless transactions and updates across parties,\n eliminating intermediaries and fostering a trusted environment for resource\n management. This paper details the development of this decentralized system,\n incorporating smart contracts for autonomous operation. Decentralized\n systems provide superior security, transparency, and immutability, making\n them fundamentally more robust and efficient than centralized systems for\n managing complex, multi-stakeholder scenarios like dis-aster response. This\n decentralized model ensures transparency, eliminates intermediaries, and\n enables all parties to conduct transactions and updates reliably. These\n contracts effectively assess and prioritize the needs of affected\n individuals, ensuring timely and accurate resource allocation. A proof of\n concept has been implemented, demonstrating the practicality and potential\n impact of NGO-RMSD. Designed in alignment with NGO's field requirements and\n distributed under a free software license, this system promises to\n significantly improve coordination for disaster resource management.\n Possible improvements and future work for a more sustainable system is\n discussed. Looking forward, we aim to enhance the efficiency and\n effectiveness of disaster relief efforts by providing assistance to a larger\n number of affected individuals in a more organized and expeditious manner."

        "abstract": "Grid decarbonization is transitioning the generation method's (GM) topology towards a distributed energy resource (DER)\u2010centric decentralized topology. However, the control method (CM) and energy management system (EMS) are yet to decentralize, resulting in topological mismatch\u2010related issues that pose significant operational challenges. Due to the advantages of topological synergy, CM research is moving towards decentralized topologies. However, the EMS lacks a clear development path and defined target parameters. This study investigates the interdependencies between GM, CM, and EMS topologies, determining their relationship to forecast the future trajectory of EMS research and to determine robust evaluation parameters for EMS proposals. Topological analysis revealed a strong influence of one sector on another, placing significant pressure to decentralize the EMS. Utilizing these findings, a detailed evaluation of the proposed cloud\u2010edge, cluster, and blockchain\u2010based EMS proposals against the established parameters revealed that blockchain\u2010based architectures best aligned with the incoming decentralized GM and CM's limitations, requirements, and advantages, offering superior security, resilience, adaptability, and scalability. Furthermore, blockchain technology has largely overcome the regulatory barriers and technical challenges, such as communication overheads, making blockchain\u2010based EMS the most effective and efficient choice for a next\u2010gen EMS."

Despite the importance, research on privacy preservation of distributed energy resource (DER) control in a fully scalable manner is lacked. To fill the gap, this paper designs a novel decentralized privacy-preserving DER control framework that 1) achieves control scalability over DER population and heterogeneity; 2) eliminates peer-to-peer communications and secures the privacy of all participating DERs against various types of adversaries; and 3) enjoys higher computation efficiency and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art privacy-preserving methods. A strongly coupled optimization problem is formulated to control the power consumption and output of DERs, including solar photovoltaics and energy storage systems, then solved using the projected gradient method. Cloud computing and secret sharing are seamlessly integrated into the proposed decentralized computing to achieve privacy preservation. Simulation results prove the capabilities of the proposed approach in DER control applications."

The proposed system employs wireless sensor modules strategically mounted on each building, equipped to read parameters related to energy consumption. These modules communicate data to a central controller using RF communication. The system integrates both grid power and solar solutions, providing a comprehensive overview of energy usage. The main controller, connected to the internet, uploads the collected data to the cloud, enabling centralized monitoring and analysis. This decentralized approach allows for real-time monitoring of energy usage in offline locations, facilitating more efficient energy management and resource allocation. The paper discusses the design, implementation, and preliminary results of the system, demonstrating its potential for enhancing energy sustainability in diverse environments."

        "abstract": "In the evolving landscape of computing environments, fog computing has emerged as a pivotal technology for handling the increasing demands of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Fog computing, with its decentralized approach, brings computational power closer to IoT devices, reducing latency and bandwidth constraints. However, this distributed architecture poses significant cybersecurity challenges, necessitating a holistic mathematical model to ensure the security and integrity of fog resources. This review presents a comprehensive mathematical cyber security model that is tailored to fog resource management in computing environments. The models generally encompass a wide array of security aspects, including data confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authentication. Leveraging advanced mathematical techniques, the models offer a robust framework for assessing and enhancing security in fog computing systems. The key components include threat modeling, risk assessment, and dynamic resource allocation strategies. By systematically analyzing potential threats and vulnerabilities specific to fog computing, these models assist in devising effective countermeasures and security policies. Moreover, there is a need to incorporate an adaptive resource allocation algorithm to dynamically allocate computing resources based on security priorities and real-time threat assessments. This review demonstrates the effectiveness of the mathematical cyber security model in bolstering the resilience of fog computing environments. The review highlights the need for safeguarding the next generation of fog computing systems against cyber threats, fostering the continued growth and adoption of transformative technology."

        "abstract": "Resource-constrained robots often suffer from energy inefficiencies, underutilized computational abilities due to inadequate task allocation, and a lack of robustness in dynamic environments, all of which strongly affect their performance. This paper introduces DREAM - Decentralized Reinforcement Learning for Exploration and Efficient Energy Management in Multi-Robot Systems, a comprehensive framework that optimizes the allocation of resources for efficient exploration. It advances beyond conventional heuristic-based task planning as observed conventionally. The framework incorporates Operational Range Estimation using Reinforcement Learning to perform exploration and obstacle avoidance in unfamiliar terrains. DREAM further introduces an Energy Consumption Model for goal allocation, thereby ensuring mission completion under constrained resources using a Graph Neural Network. This approach also ensures that the entire Multi-Robot System can survive for an extended period of time for further missions compared to the conventional approach of randomly allocating goals, which compromises one or more agents. Our approach adapts to prioritizing agents in real-time, showcasing remarkable resilience against dynamic environments. This robust solution was evaluated in various simulated environments, demonstrating adaptability and applicability across diverse scenarios. We observed a substantial improvement of about 25% over the baseline method, leading the way for future research in resource-constrained robotics."

        "abstract": "The Energy-Water-Food (EWF) nexus is a complex and multidimensional system, in which the energy, water and food resources are strongly interconnected. EWF nexus systems are seriously threatened by natural hazards (e.g., climate change and extreme weather events) along with other human-driven threats, including rapid population growth, urbanization, terrorism, and geopolitical uncertainty. As such, integrated analysis, as encouraged by the EWF nexus can facilitate the identification of essential connections and potential conflicts that may arise in the planning and operation of resource systems. Moreover, in order to consider immediate shocks and long-term pressures, it is imperative to prioritize the strengthening of EWF system resilience by incorporating robust and efficient resource management strategies, which consider various dimensions of sustainability and security such as technical, environmental, economic, and societal aspects. Decentralization is one concept that has the potential of improving the resilience of nexus systems faced to the multiple risks governing them through reducing single points of failure and enabling swifter responses to sudden shocks and continuous volatilities. However, in order to achieve a holistic system resilience through decentralization, the assessment of the different risks impacting each nexus sector is fundamental, yet it can be particularly challenging. Therefore, the objective of this study is to review the currently available resilience assessment methods for the EWF nexus system. The systematic literature review will connect various assessment methods used within decentralization studies that are applied to improve the resilience performance of the EWF nexus system. A total of 84 journal papers were evaluated. The review demonstrates that the deployment of multi-criteria decision-making framework based on composite indicators can be effective in addressing risks and uncertainties within EWF systems. Furthermore, findings of this review illustrate complementary connections between decentralization and resilience concepts, which when integrated with the EWF nexus approach, can be effectively utilized for integrated sustainable resource management."

Our review offers a critical examination of the challenges and advancements in AI-based energy management to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), focusing on SDG7, SDG11, and SDG13. We delve into the limitations and potential pitfalls of current AI and cybersecurity approaches in renewable energy, categorizing microgrid issues into optimal power flow, peakshaving, and optimal network configurations. Our discussion extends to the promise and constraints of metaheuristics, reinforcement learning, and blockchain technology for decentralized energy management and cybersecurity, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of these technologies\u2019 environmental impacts and ethical considerations. Through detailed analysis of various case studies, we scrutinize the specifics of system size, grid connectivity, and the types of AI/cybersecurity measures implemented, enhancing their generalizability and applicability. This review synthesizes findings from 20 research studies, providing a comprehensive perspective on the synergistic role of AI and cybersecurity in advancing renewable energy systems while critically evaluating the field\u2019s current state and suggesting directions for future research, policy, and industry practices. By explicitly linking these findings to the achievement of the SDGs, we underscore the importance of high-resolution, accurately cited images to convey our message effectively and advocate for the thoughtful integration of AI in renewable energy systems to ensure their secure, efficient, and sustainable operation."

Despite the increasing deployment, the potential of DERs has yet to be fully explored and exploited. A fundamental question restrains the management of numerous DERs in large-scale power systems, \u201c How should DER data be securely processed and DER operations be efficiently optimized? \u201d To address this question, this paper considers two critical issues, namely privacy for processing DER data and scalability in optimizing DER operations , then surveys existing and emerging solutions from a multi-agent framework perspective. In the context of scalability, this paper reviews state-of-the-art research that relies on parallel control, optimization, and learning within distributed and/or decentralized information exchange structures, while in the context of privacy, it identifies privacy preservation measures that can be synthesized into the aforementioned scalable structures. Despite research advances in these areas, challenges remain because these highly interdisciplinary studies blend a wide variety of scalable computing architectures and privacy preservation techniques from different fields, making them difficult to adapt in practice. To mitigate this issue, this paper provides a holistic review of trending strategies that orchestrate privacy and scalability for large-scale power system operations from a multi-agent perspective, particularly for DER control problems. Furthermore, this review extrapolates new approaches for future scalable, privacy-aware, and cybersecure pathways to unlock the full potential of DERs through controlling, optimizing, and learning generic multi-agent-based cyber-physical systems."

However, the introduction of communication networks inevitably brings about time delays. Against this backdrop, this article proposes a distributed networked predictive control (DNPC) strategy for DC MGs suffering from time-varying communication delays. The proposed strategy can regulate the DG's voltage to the desired value and optimize each DG's generation cost simultaneously. Explicitly, the multistep predictor generates predictions for both local nodes and neighbor DGs, using the pseudo-prediction-enabled method. Thus, the delayed information in control protocols can be replaced by the latest predictions, so as to realize the active compensation for delays. Furthermore, the analysis of the stability of the closed-loop MG system is presented to ensure the generality of the DNPC strategy. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed control system against the time-varying delay effect is verified by comprehensive experiments in a DC MG containing a wind turbine generator."

In the proposed control strategy, we first design a primary droop-free model predictive controller to make the output voltage track its nominal set points timely, with the neighbor-based error information a secondary distributed coordinated predictive controller is then proposed to actively compensate the general communication delays for cyber-physical microgrids caused by low-bandwidth communication networks. Sufficient conditions, in terms of communication network connectivity and control gains for the system stability are derived by using the tools of special matrix theory and algebraic graph theory. The proposed control protocols are fully distributed and can be implemented through a sparse communication network and thus, satisfy the plug-and-play feature of the future smart grid. The effectiveness of the control strategy in compensating communication delays is also verified by real-time simulation experiments in OPAL-RT on a test microgrid."

When distributed generators (DGs) in a microgrid are subject to attacks, their transmitted state information would be tampered and thus affect the dynamics of normal generators. In order to isolate possible attacks, two types of trust evaluation metrics with different attack indices and time scales are designed, by which the performance of neighboring DGs can be assessed for specific practical demands. Based on the trust values of each neighbor, a reputation-propagation method is introduced at triggered time instants to determine whether a DG is under attack by comprehensively incorporating the opinion of mutual neighbors. The dynamic updating law of the communication edge weights is utilized with the derived reputation values. Based on this, a distributed Zeno-free event-triggered control protocols for voltage/frequency restoration and active power sharing are proposed. Sufficient conditions for picking proper control parameters are given in the main theorem. Lastly, the simulations are conducted in MATLAB/SimPowerSystems for several scenarios to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms."

Convergence time of consensus algorithm significantly affects transient stability of microgrids, due to changes in communication topology, switching of distributed generations (DGs), and uncertainty of intermittent energy sources. To minimise convergence time in consensus protocol, this work proposes a multilayer event-based consensus control framework, which is resilient to communication delays and supports plug-and-play (P&P) addition or removal of DGs in DC microgrids of cellular energy systems. A novel bi-layer optimisation algorithm minimises convergence time by selecting an optimal communication topology graph and then adjusts controllers' parameters. Average consensus is achieved among distributed controllers using an event-based consensus protocol, considering non-uniform delays between agents. A realisation method has also been introduced using the directional beamforming technique for topology assignment algorithm based on modern telecommunication technologies. Provided feasibility case study has been implemented on a real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimental testbed, to validate the performance of the proposed framework for key purposes of voltage stabilisation and balanced power-sharing in DC microgrids."

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a stochastic distributed secondary control scheme for both frequency/voltage restoration and optimal active power sharing (e.g., minimize the total generation cost) of ac microgrids by employing event-triggered communication mechanism in noisy environments. Compared with existing ideal and periodic communication among distributed generations (DG), the proposed stochastic distributed secondary control scheme can achieve mean-square synchronization for frequency and voltage restoration of DGs and the optimal active power sharing for their economic operation through a sparse communication network, even though the communication channels are susceptible to noise interferences and limited bandwidth constraints. The stochastic distributed control protocols are designed to be employed into the secondary control stage for microgrids, which is a fully distributed control paradigm. With the proposed control protocols, control deviations of frequency and voltage produced during the primary control stage can be well remedied and the optimal active power sharing for their economic operation can be well achieved simultaneously. Furthermore, the graph theory, stochastic theory and Lyapunov functional approach are employed to derive the stability and convergence analysis of the proposed dynamic event-triggered conditions considering noise interferences. Simulation results on an islanded microgrid test system are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control protocols."

        "abstract": "In a seaport microgrid (SMG), power sharing among distributed generation (DG) units is hindered by power coupling, line changes, and frequent power fluctuations caused by ship charging and discharging through cold ironing, which, in turn, threatens system stability and inverter security. This article proposes a delay-tolerant distributed adaptive virtual impedance control strategy for assigned active and reactive power sharing, so as to suppress the circulating current among DGs. First, the nonlinear impedance-power droop equations (IPDEs) are derived to actively update the resistive and inductive components of virtual impedance, which can accommodate changes in line structure and output power. Second, by means of low-bandwidth communication with quantized data and time delay, the desired power terms derived from practical consensus protocols are fed into the IPDEs, for which the proposed scheme gives a quantitative maximum tolerable communication delay with respect to power sharing accuracy. Third, considering the voltage drop caused by virtual impedance, inspired by traditional synchronous generators, we design a virtual impedance loop based on virtual damping and inertia to preserve voltage dynamics. Finally, an SMG containing four DG units is simulated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy on both active and reactive power sharing."

        "abstract": "The DC microgrid systems include power electronic converters with information and communication technology. The performance of the DC microgrids will be determined by how effectively these converters are controlled. These communication protocols that support microgrids based on cooperative control are highly vulnerable to cyberattacks. False data injection attack (FDIA) is a kind of cyber-attack in which attackers attempt to introduce false data into the targeted DC microgrid in order to shut it down and destabilize it. Furthermore, the inherent characteristics of communication networks in microgrids may result in delays or/and packet drops in data transmissions between Distributed Generation Units (DGU). These network issues can degrade the stability and control loop performance, resulting in microgrid system uncertainty. Limited papers are available in the literature focusing on resilience against cyber-attacks and communication delays for DC microgrids in one platform. Thus, this paper discusses the impact of FDIAs on parallel DC/DC converter-structured DC microgrids that use droop-based control techniques to sustain the required DC voltage level using voltage observer and current regulator techniques. An unconventional delay-dependent stability condition is formulated and the system\u2019s control parameters are adopted using the Lyapunov stability theory and Linear matrix inequality (LMI). The proposed method is tested under various circumstances, physical actions, and cyber-attacks, such as load changing, communication delay, packet loss, time-varying attacks, etc. The outcomes demonstrate the efficacy of the suggested approach in detecting and mitigating the considered attacks in DC microgrids using the MATLAB/Simulink tool."

Whether the communication delays exist or not, the control protocols always guarantee that the output voltage amplitude and frequency of each distributed generator synchronize to the reference values and maintain the optimal active power sharing and the accurate reactive power sharing properties. Moreover, our proposed control protocols are implemented through sparse communication networks and thus meet the plug-and-play feature of the future smart grid.

        "abstract": "There is an increasing interest and research effort focused on the analysis, design and implementation of distributed control systems for AC, DC and hybrid AC / DC microgrids. It is claimed that distributed controllers have several advantages over centralised control schemes, e.g., improved reliability, flexibility, controllability, black start operation, robustness to failure in the communication links, etc. In this work, an overview of the state-of-the-art of distributed cooperative control systems for isolated microgrids is presented. Protocols for cooperative control such as linear consensus, heterogeneous consensus and finite-time consensus are discussed and reviewed in this paper. Distributed cooperative algorithms for primary and secondary control systems, including (among others issues) virtual impedance, synthetic inertia, droop-free control, stability analysis, imbalance sharing, total harmonic distortion regulation, are also reviewed and discussed in this survey. Tertiary control systems, e.g., for economic dispatch of electric energy, based on cooperative control approaches, are also addressed in this work. This review also highlights existing issues, research challenges and future trends in distributed cooperative control of microgrids and their future applications."

        "abstract": "Most of the distributed control strategies for grid-connected power converters are droop-based approaches composed of converters driven in voltage-control mode, based on local and shared data with adjacent units. They are usually combined with consensus protocols to deal with the trade-off between power sharing accuracy and voltage/frequency regulation. To achieve the desired results these control systems usually incorporate other techniques and need to take into account details of primary control dynamic. Additionally, power flow control and current unbalance compensation at the PCC are rarely addressed in such approaches. Contrariwise, the centralized control strategy power-based control has been successful in achieving these functionalities. It is oriented to a set point selection to the whole system, considering converters driven in current-control mode and a central converter in voltage-control mode. However, the dependence on centralized communication network in this method still requires improvement. Thereby, the complementary features of both strategies are combined herein in the consensus power-based control, based on a master/slave peer-to-peer integration using sparse communication. This model-free approach provides all aforementioned benefits to the grid without any other technique. Implementation complexity and costs are decreased, while the flexibility and reliability are enhanced. All these achievements are demonstrated by simulation results under different operational conditions and compared to previous works."

Fast-growing unbounded False Data Injection (FDI) unbounded attacks injected in virtual control inputs lead to risks of rapid system instability and collapse. However, traditional noise-resilient or bounded-attack-resilient control protocols for DC microgrids are not capable of handling these unbounded attack signals. This paper introduces the secondary defense strategies that addresses these unbounded FDI attack signals, thereby enhancing the resilience of DC micro-grids in adversarial environments. Rigorous proofs, employing Lyapunov techniques, affirm that the proposed defense strategies guarantee voltage regulation and proportional load sharing under polynomially unbounded FDI attacks. Comparative case studies corroborate the enhanced resilience of the proposed attack-resilient control strategies."

        "abstract": "Recent communication, computation, and technology advances coupled with climate change concerns have transformed the near future prospects of electricity transmission, and, more notably, distribution systems and microgrids. Distributed resources (wind and solar generation, combined heat and power) and flexible loads (storage, computing, EV, HVAC) make it imperative to increase investment and improve operational efficiency. Commercial and residential buildings, being the largest energy consumption group among flexible loads in microgrids, have the largest potential and flexibility to provide demand side management. Recent advances in networked systems and the anticipated breakthroughs of the Internet of Things will enable significant advances in demand response capabilities of intelligent load network of power-consuming devices such as HVAC components, water heaters, and buildings. In this paper, a new operating framework, called packetized direct load control (PDLC), is proposed based on the notion of quantization of energy demand. This control protocol is built on top of two communication protocols that carry either complete or binary information regarding the operation status of the appliances. We discuss the optimal demand side operation for both protocols and analytically derive the performance differences between the protocols. We propose an optimal reservation strategy for traditional and renewable energy for the PDLC in both day-ahead and real time markets. In the end we discuss the fundamental trade-off between achieving controllability and endowing flexibility."

        "abstract": "To compensate for the voltage and frequency deviations caused by the droop control in islanded microgrids (MGs), employing an additional control level, called the secondary control, is necessary. Therefore, distributed control methods based on the sparse communication network, are recently employed in secondary control of MGs, because they are more reliable and flexible. However, traditional methods use the centralized communication network, which is neither economical nor efficient due to its large communication burden. Distributed control methods solve many challenges in the secondary layer of MGs, such as disturbances, uncertainties, unmodelled dynamics, noises, delays, attacks, and actuator faults. This paper proposes the novel resilient adaptive consensus-based voltage and frequency control protocols to compensate for the adverse effects of both sensor and actuator faults in communication network channels of islanded MGs. To this end, local adaptive sensor and actuator compensators eliminate the adverse effects of failures on sensors and actuators. The robust stability analysis based on the Lyapunov analysis is given to validate the results. Finally, the understudy islanded MG system is built in MATLAB/SimPowerSystems to verify the theoretical results. It is shown that the proposed secondary control strategies based on the adaptive protocols can highly increase the reliability and resiliency of the MG system compared with the existing distributed resilient methods."

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel distributed noise-resilient secondary control for voltage and frequency restoration of islanded microgrid inverter-based distributed generations (DGs) with an additive type of noise. The existing distributed methods commonly are designed as secondary control system systems that operate on the assumption of ideal communication networks among DGs. However, the channels are prone to stochastic noise, whereas each DG obtains noisy measurements of the states of its neighbors via environmental noises. The existing distributed noise-resilient methods, ignore a complete model of the system. In contrast, this paper proposes consensus protocols that take into account both the noisy measurements and a complete nonlinear model of the system, examines the mean-square average consensus for voltage and frequency restoration of islanded ac microgrids in an uncertain environment, and provides accurate proportional real power sharing. Our proposed consensus protocol contains two parts: the state feedback of the agent and the relative states of the DG and its neighboring DGs. Finally, simulation studies are carried out in MATLAB/SimPowerSystems to evaluate the performance of the control laws. Simulation results and comparison with previous work reveals the effectiveness of the proposed method in regulating microgrid voltage and frequency and providing accurate proportional real power sharing."

        "abstract": "Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are the complex systems that control and coordinate physical infrastructures, which may be geographically apart, via the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). One such application of CPS is smart microgrids. Microgrids comprise both power consuming and power producing infrastructure and are capable of operating in grid connected and disconnected modes. Due to the presence of heterogeneous smart devices communicating over multiple communication protocols in a distributed environment, a system architecture is required. The objective of this paper is to approach the microgrid architecture from the software and systems\u2019 design perspective. The architecture should be flexible to support various multiple communication protocols and is able to integrate various hardware technologies. It should also be modular and scalable to support various functionalities such as island mode operations, energy efficient operations, energy trading, predictive maintenance, etc. These requirements are the basis for designing the software architecture for the smart microgrids that should be able to manage not only electrical but all energy related systems. In this work, we propose a distributed, hybrid control architecture suited for microgrid environments, where entities are geographically distant and need to operate in a cohesive manner. The proposed system architecture supports various design philosophies such as component-based design, hierarchical composition of components, peer-to-peer design, distributed decision-making and controlling as well as plug-and-play during runtime. A unique capability of the proposed system architecture is the self-similarity of the components for the distributed microgrids. The benefit of the approach is that it supports these design philosophies at all the levels in the hierarchy in contrast to a typical centralized architectures where decisions are taken only at the global level. The proposed architecture is applied to a real system of 13 residential buildings in a low-voltage distribution network. The required implementation and deployment details for monitoring and controlling 13 residential buildings are also discussed in this work."

        "abstract": "Microgrids (MGs) can effectively integrate distributed energy resources (DERs) and support the resilient functioning of the future power grid. In the literature, distributed MG control algorithms based on consensus protocols are proposed that distribute the computation and communication tasks to computational nodes at each DER, thus naturally supporting \u201cplug-and-play\u201d integration and improving resilience. Shifting to the distributed control paradigm requires a complete rethink and redesign of the current MG controller framework and implementation. In this article, we propose a framework for distributed generic MG controllers with the support of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. With the proposed framework, distributed generic MG controllers can be designed to support all use cases of an MG, including grid-connected and islanded operations, planned/unplanned islanding, and reconnecting. We implement the proposed framework using a novel open-source platform, called Resilient Information Architecture Platform for the Smart Grid (RIAPS) and demonstrate its performance using hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests."

        "abstract": "This paper aims to establish a virtual object management system, as well as optimal task scheduling using the foundation of Digital Twins (DT), to improve the user\u2019s experience with management and to accomplish the task efficiently. On the other hand, offloading tasks using IoT gadgets to edge computing, fails to speed up control by users. The capabilities of the DT are provided by executing processes such as visualization, virtualization, synchronization, and simulation. The optimal selection of the virtual objects for the DT is done by utilizing the implemented Hybrid Energy Valley with L\u00e9vy Flight Distribution Optimization (HEV-LFDO) in order to optimally offload the task by the edge devices. The optimal selection of the virtual objects is done with the aid of the HEV-LFDO in the DT by considering the total cost of executing all tasks using the selected virtual objects and the decision variables to determine whether a virtual object is taken for executing a task or not as the constraint. The data for performing resource management is secured using the blockchain or distributed ledger technology. This accounts for the minimization of the local loss function. Finally, the secured data is considered for optimal resource management tasks. The optimal resource management is done using the same HEV-LFDO. This optimal resource management is carried out by considering the constraints like the cost of assigning a virtual object for the task to the edge device, and the cost of assigning the task to the edge device. These two costs are analyzed by taking the network\u2019s bandwidth, energy consumption, and computational resources into consideration. Experimental verifications are conducted on the executed optimal resource management scheme to prove the ability of the implemented model to be integrated with the edge computing network. The overall processing time as well as the latency are also minimized by executing the optimal resource management scheme."

These characteristics make blockchain adoption appealing for enhancing information security, privacy and reliability in a variety of scenarios. This article develops the trust with reputation-based management for the financial stock market. Here distributed ledger technology (DLT) has been integrated for implementing the ledger in which data is stored across a network of decentralized nodes. By this, proof-based ledger has been maintained with transparency, traceability and security. DLT here used is based on trust design in mitigating the malicious activities of the financial stock marketing technology. Then using Bayesian theory based on the fault tolerance (BDLT_FT) model has been used in improving the efficiency of DLT and financial technology. This acts as the protocol which reduces energy consumption and enhance network scalability and security in digital transactions like cryptocurrency The financial data related to blockchain cryptocurrency were collected between the time period 2000 and 2020. The dataset of the stock market is evaluated under the fault tolerance model with statistical analysis. The statistical evaluation of financial data with developed BDLT_FT expressed that there is no association between the fault tolerance and the classification error."

        "abstract": "\n The Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) project lifecycle consists of multiple organizations, private and public, that work together to carry out the licensing and regulation, commissioning, construction, supply chain management, decommissioning, and non-proliferation of nuclear power plants. Each stage of the lifecycle generates a considerable amount of documentation that needs to be archived and made available on request. In this paper, we examined the current frameworks employed by the stakeholders of nuclear power plant lifecycles for data generation, classification, archival, and exchange and we evaluated the use of distributed ledger technology for data management. We further demonstrated the implementation of distributed ledger technology to capturing and immutable recording nuclear supply chain structure, production, and failure data.\n Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) promises to address the current bottlenecks in the lifecycle management of nuclear power plants with faster data exchange times, lower processing cost of documents, bridging the gap between perceived and actual risk, faster decisions, customizable transparency in job tasks being executed, improved cash flow, instant validation of job completion, reduction in logistical friction, and sped up supply chain decisions for clients. We gave a comprehensive review of distributed ledger technology, its properties and an open-source permissioned distributed ledger system called Hyperledger Fabric.\n Each sector of the nuclear power plant lifecycle was analyzed for data management bottlenecks and building on our discussion of employing distributed ledger technology we discussed the pathway in which Hyperledger Fabric can be employed to address the data management bottlenecks in each stage of the lifecycle including, licensing and regulation, commissioning, construction, supply chain management, decommissioning, and non-proliferation."

It addresses the challenges of ensuring data exchange in a simple, scalable, and affordable way. The communication platform for data exchange is using Ethereum Blockchain technology. It provides a distributed ledger database across a distributed network, supports simple connectivity for new stakeholders, and enables many small entities to contribute with their flexible energy to the system balancing. The architecture of a simulation/emulation environment provides a direct connection of a relational database to the Ethereum network, thus enabling dynamic data management. In addition, it extends security of the environment with security mechanisms of relational databases. Proof-of-concept setup with the simulation of system balancing processes, confirms the suitability of the solution for secure data exchange in the market, operation, and measurement area. For the most intensive and space-consuming measurement data exchange, we have investigated data aggregation to ensure performance optimisation of required computation and space usage."

        "abstract": "Pollution-monitoring systems (PMSs) are used worldwide to sense environmental changes, such as air quality conditions or temperature increases, and to monitor compliance with regulations. However, organizations manage the environmental data collected by such PMSs in a centralized manner, which is why recorded environmental data are vulnerable to manipulation. Moreover, the analysis of pollution data often lacks transparency to outsiders, which may lead to wrong decisions regarding environmental regulations. To address these challenges, we propose a software design for PMSs based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) and the long-range (LoRa) protocol for flexible, transparent, and energy-efficient environment monitoring and data management. To design the PMS, we conducted a comprehensive requirements analysis for PMSs. We benchmarked different consensus mechanisms (e.g., BFT-SMaRt and Raft) and digital signature schemes (e.g., ECDSA and EdDSA) to adequately design the PMS and fulfill the identified requirements. On this basis, we designed and implemented a prototype PMS and evaluated it in the field. The evaluation shows the effectiveness of DLT-based PMSs that include portable low-energy sensor nodes and demonstrates the applicability of the proposed software design for PMSs in contexts other than air pollution."

Creating a unified European energy dataspace aligned with GAIA-X principles (transparency, data security, data protection, interoperability and scalability) is crucial to overcoming this challenge. This paper presents a solution that combines a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)-based data marketplace with the International Data Spaces (IDS) Architecture. By utilizing DLT, the proposed marketplace enables secure and transparent tracking of energy datasets within the dataspace. Integration with the IDSA ensures compliance with GAIA-X, promoting interoperability and seamless data exchange. It enables the consolidation of diverse data sources into a unified dataspace, eliminating silos. This fosters efficient and secure data exchange, promotes transparency and trust, and supports collaboration and innovation in the energy sector."

        "abstract": "Nowadays, blockchain is developing as a secure and trustworthy platform for secure information sharing in areas of application like banking, supply chain management, food industry, energy, the Internet, and medical services. Besides, the blockchain can be described in a decentralized manner as an immutable ledger for recording data entries. Furthermore, this new technology has been developed to interrupt a variety of data-driven fields, including the health sector. However, blockchain refers to the distributed ledger technology, which constitutes an innovation in the information recording and sharing without a trusted third party. In this paper, blockchain and Distributed Ledger-based Improved Biomedical Security system (BDL-IBS) has been proposed to enhance the privacy and data security across healthcare applications. Further, our goal is to make it possible for patients to use the data to support their care and to provide strong consent systems for sharing data among different organizations and applications, since this includes managing and accessing a high amount of medical information, and this technology can maintain data to ensure reliability. Finally, results show that new blockchain-based digital platforms allow for fast, easy, and seamless interactions between data suppliers to enhance privacy and data security, including for patients themselves."

However, an open issue that slows the adoption of blockchain technology in the energy sector is the low scalability and high processing overhead when dealing with the real-time energy data collected by smart energy meters. Thus, in this paper, we propose a scalable second tier solution which combines the blockchain ledger with distributed queuing systems and NoSQL (Not Only SQL database) databases to allow the registration of energy transactions less frequently on the chain without losing the tamper-evident benefits brought by the blockchain technology. At the same time, we propose a technique for tamper-evident registration of smart meters\u2019 energy data and associated energy transactions using digital fingerprinting which allows the energy transaction to be linked hashed-back on-chain, while the sensors data is stored off-chain. A prototype was implemented using Ethereum and smart contracts for the on-chain components while for the off-chain components we used Cassandra database and RabbitMQ messaging broker. The prototype proved to be effective in managing a settlement of energy imbalances use-case and during the evaluation conducted in simulated environment shows promising results in terms of scalability, throughput, and tampering of energy data sampled by smart energy meters."

An example of DLT is a blockchain where data form blocks in an append-only chain. Software architecture description usually comprises multiple views. The paper concentrates on the Deployment view of the DLT solution within the 1+5 architectural views model. The authors have proposed Unified Modeling Language (UML) extensibility mechanisms to describe the needed additional semantic notation to model deployment details. The paper covers both the network and node levels. The proposed stereotypes and tagged values have enriched the UML Deployment diagram. We have gathered those modeling elements in dedicated UML Profile for Distributed Ledger Deployment. We have applied the profile to model the Deployment view of a renewable energy management system that uses the R3Cordaframework. The system records information about inbound and outbound energy to/from a renewable energy grid."

In terms of management and monitoring, human control factors are high, causing the ecological environment monitoring platform to fall into difficulties such as low data credibility, no traceability, and low security. Distributed ledger technology, as one of the core technologies of the blockchain, can disperse the confirmed data among multiple nodes for simultaneous consensus and give it a timestamp. It ensures the traceability and decentralization of data and avoids the occurrence of data islands and unreliable data during the environmental monitoring process. Combined with the characteristics of distributed ledger technology such as traceability, decentralization, non-tamperability, and openness, we explore its role in the ecological environment monitoring platform from various aspects such as environmental quality monitoring, resource management, behavioral supervision and restraint, and energy usage monitoring. feasibility, and pointed out the risks and challenges faced by distributed ledger technology in the application of ecological environment monitoring platforms. Assist in the design and construction of ecological environment monitoring platforms in the digital era."

The main causes are lack of management in the energy sector and the use of non-renewable energy sources. The improved energy management and use of renewable sources can be significant to resolve energy crisis. It is necessary to increase the use of renewable energy sources (RESs) to meet the increasing energy demand due to high prices of fossil-fuel based energy. Federated learning (FL) is the most emerging technique in the field of artificial intelligence. Federated learning helps to generate global model at server side by ensemble locally trained models at remote edges sites while preserving data privacy. The global model used to predict energy demand to satisfy the needs of consumers. In this article, we have proposed Blockchain based safe distributed ledger technology for transaction of data between prosumer and consumer to ensure their transparency, traceability and security. Furthermore, we have also proposed a Federated learning model to forecast the energy requirements of consumer and prosumer. Moreover, Blockchain has been used to store excess energy data from prosumer for better management of energy between prosumer and grid. Lastly, the experiment results revealed that renewable energy sources have produced better and comparable results to other non-renewable energy resources."

In this study we propose a blockchain based digital identity management framework that implements privacy, security and transparency by employing distributed ledger technology. To provide tamper proof identity storage and automated verification, the proposed model uses cryptographic hashing and smart contracts. The use of a novel token-based access mechanism enables users to safely share their identity data with third parties, while keeping sensitive information out of sight. Security metrics are enhanced by 30% for data integrity with 45% reduction in unauthorized access attempts all through simulations. The framework also achieves improved efficiency reducing identity verification time by 40 percent compared to traditional systems. It offers a promising approach to address important vulnerabilities in centralized identity management in line with the development of marketable and user-friendly digital identity solutions."

The distributed ledger and Blockchain technologies had brought solutions through transparently bridging two or multiple untrusted parties. In this research, a novel architecture for a smart building system, including a control system and automatic approaches, is proposed. An efficient cluster head selection algorithm is proposed to select the desired cluster head with the consideration of low energy consumption and fast head selection. An enhanced combination of IoT forwarding devices and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technology is further advanced. Furthermore, the proposed \u201cDistBlockBuilding\u201d architecture is implemented for managing a safe and secure data transfer from one surface to another surface. Besides, Blockchain technology is performed for transferring data within the smart building. Finally, the performance of IoT-SDN based secured networks is evaluated."

The proposed platform considers green power transactions across microgrids, bidirectional power and green power charging and discharging transactions in microgrids, demand response bidding, and vehicle-to-vehicle emergency rescue charging. This innovative architecture operates smart contracts and distributed ledgers independently; uses smart contracts to handle bidding, matching, and settlement of the power trading platform; and simultaneously employs the cloud and local distributed ledger nodes to chain the detailed real-time transaction information and power data on the ledger. In this manner, the security and fairness of data can be ensured; furthermore, a large amount of chaining information can be processed, and the chaining latency can be shortened. In addition, the communication protocols are integrated through the artificial intelligence of things. An energy management system (EMS) is proposed, which can perform optimal charging and discharging scheduling according to the power transaction matching results and then control charging piles and energy storage system devices. It can reduce the operating cost of microgrids in commercial buildings, increase the efficiency of green power utilization, and reduce power loss. In this system, power transactions are automatically and simultaneously executed in the EMS to achieve real-time supply and demand balance of regional microgrids."

Next, we assess the security risks and computational challenges associated with these models, offering a comparative analysis of their performance in addressing concerns such as latency, scalability, and susceptibility to cyber-attacks. Proposed solutions, including encryption techniques and real-time threat detection, are discussed to strengthen the resilience of smart grids. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research, particularly in advancing cybersecurity measures and optimizing data processing in an increasingly interconnected energy infrastructure."

This new grid model allows customers and providers to generate and manage electrical power efficiently. To support such transformation, a key element of the model is the communication network responsible for delivering measurement data from sensors on the grid to the applications that analyze and adapt distribution according to demands. This work proposes and evaluates a system architecture that copes with reliability and latency demands that are of much importance for a successful Smart Grid deployment, also considering the internal design of distributed applications in the context of Smart Grids. The architecture adopts a Mobile Edge Computing based infrastructure that is suitable for 4G and 5G mobile cellular networks. Experiments made on NS-3 shows that the proposed system architecture is capable of handling a realistic number of smart meters while providing low latency and network reliability, supporting many use cases of a Smart Grid deployment."

We specifically focus on the network of the phasor measurement units (PMUs) as an example of the industrial internet of things in smart grids and discuss the edge-computing platform architecture to enable data analytics for DSE using the PMU time-series. We discuss that it is important to consider the physics of the smart grid in designing the edge-computing layer. As an example, we present a data-driven method for detecting power line trips using the PMU data and the designed physics-aware edge-computing platform."

        "abstract": "The explosive development of electrical engineering in the early 19th century marked the birth of the 2nd industrial revolution, with the use of electrical energy in place of steam power, as well as changing the history of human development. The versatility of electricity allows people to apply it to a multitude of fields such as transportation, heat applications, lighting, telecommunications, and computers. Nowadays, with the breakout development of science and technology, electric energy sources are formed by many different technologies such as hydroelectricity, solar power, wind power, coal power, etc. These energy sources are connected to form grid systems to transmit electricity to cities, businesses and homes for life and work. Electrical energy today has become the backbone of all modern technologies. To ensure the safe, reliable and energy-efficient operation of the grid, a wide range of grid management applications have been proposed. However, a significant challenge for monitoring and controlling grids is service response time. In recent times, to solve this problem, smart grid management applications based on IoT and edge computing have been proposed. In this work, we perform a comprehensive survey of edge computing for IoT-enabled smart grid systems. In addition, recent smart grid frameworks based on IoT and edge computing are discussed, important requirements are presented, and the open issues and challenges are indicated. We believe that in the Internet of Things era, the smart grid will be the future of energy. We hope that these study results will contribute important guidelines for in-depth research in the field of smart grids and green energy in the future."

        "abstract": "Compute-intensive Internet of Things (IoTs) applications have led to the edge computing paradigm. Edge computing decentralizes the IT infrastructure in multiple edge data centers (EDCs) across the access networks to reduce latency and network congestion. Edge computing can benefit significantly from different aspects of smart grids to achieve lower energy consumption and greater resilience to electricity price fluctuations. This paper presents a modeling, simulation, and optimization (M&S&O) framework for analyzing and dimensioning smart grid-aware edge computing federations. This tool integrates aspects of a consumer-centric smart grid model to the resource management policies of the EDCs. To illustrate the benefits of this tool, we show a realistic case study for optimizing the energy consumption and operational expenses of an edge computing federation that provides service to a driver assistance IoT application. Results show that this approach can reduce the daily energy consumption by 20.3% and the electricity budget by 30.3%."

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the integration of edge computing in smart sensor networks. In Internet of Things (IoT) applications, traditional cloud computing models cause data processing delays due to long-distance data transmission. This transmission delay significantly impairs real-time data processing and feedback capabilities, particularly in time-sensitive applications. Edge computing can transfer data to local devices for processing so that data that is affected by network congestion does not have to be transmitted long distances to the cloud for processing. It can greatly reduce the delay caused by network congestion and reduce energy consumption. In addition, it also provides certain guarantees for data security. Building upon these characteristics, edge computing offers several key advantages. First, it enables efficient local data processing for real-time operation. In some industrial applications such as smart grids and intelligent transportation systems, edge computing can operate highly autonomously. This avoids the delay caused by network fluctuations when transmitting to the cloud. This paper explores the integration of lightweight machine learning models, particularly TinyML, in edge computing applications. These models will improve the data processing capabilities of edge devices. Finally, the article also proposes further ideas for this new architecture to make up for the shortcomings of the architecture in task allocation and data processing."

        "abstract": "As urbanization accelerates, smart cities are emerging as innovative ecosystems that integrate technology to address challenges related to sustainability, mobility, and infrastructure. Among these technologies, edge computing has gained prominence as a transformative solution to optimize data processing and resource management in urban environments. This paper explores the role of edge computing in enabling efficient, real-time decision-making by bringing computational power closer to data sources. Unlike traditional cloud-centric models, edge computing reduces latency, enhances data security, and improves bandwidth utilization by distributing data processing across decentralized nodes. The integration of edge computing in smart cities supports various applications, including intelligent transportation systems, energy-efficient smart grids, and real-time public safety monitoring. By processing data locally, edge devices can handle massive volumes of information generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices, ensuring seamless service delivery without overwhelming centralized systems. Furthermore, this decentralized approach enhances resilience by reducing dependency on remote servers, a crucial factor for mission-critical urban applications. A significant focus of this paper is on resource management, particularly the allocation of computational resources across edge nodes. Strategies such as dynamic resource scheduling, load balancing, and adaptive task offloading are analyzed for their effectiveness in maintaining operational efficiency. Moreover, the research highlights the importance of leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms within edge computing frameworks to predict traffic patterns, optimize energy consumption, and enhance waste management systems. Security and privacy concerns, often considered barriers to edge computing adoption, are addressed through advanced encryption techniques and secure communication protocols. This paper also evaluates challenges associated with edge computing deployment, such as hardware limitations, interoperability issues, and the need for robust regulatory frameworks. Case studies from leading smart city projects illustrate successful implementations and offer insights into overcoming these obstacles. In addition to technical aspects, this research underscores the socioeconomic benefits of edge computing in urban settings. Improved public services, reduced environmental impact, and cost-effective infrastructure management demonstrate the potential of edge computing to revolutionize city living. By enabling real-time analytics and localized decision-making, edge computing supports a more responsive and adaptive urban ecosystem. The findings presented in this paper emphasize the critical role of edge computing in bridging the gap between urban challenges and technological solutions. As cities continue to evolve, adopting edge computing technologies will not only enhance operational efficiency but also foster innovation, sustainability, and inclusivity. Future research directions include exploring hybrid models combining edge and cloud computing, advancing hardware capabilities, and developing standardized frameworks to accelerate adoption. This paper contributes to the growing body of knowledge on edge computing, offering a comprehensive analysis of its applications, challenges, and potential in shaping the future of smart cities. By optimizing data processing and resource management, edge computing emerges as a cornerstone technology for creating smarter, more resilient urban environments."

Reviewing the currently used approaches, issues, and trends, the features related to the future development involving opportunities and risks are considered.

        "abstract": "Edge computing, as an extension of cloud computing, brings computation and data storage closer to the data source. This shift offers significant advantages in terms of latency reduction, bandwidth optimization, and real-time processing capabilities. By minimizing the distance that data needs to travel, edge computing enhances the performance of applications that require rapid data processing and immediate response times. This is particularly beneficial for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, autonomous vehicles, smart grids, and other applications that demand low-latency interactions. However, the decentralization inherent in edge computing introduces a unique set of cybersecurity challenges that are distinct from those faced in traditional centralized cloud environments. The distributed architecture of edge computing creates numerous points of vulnerability, each of which can be exploited by cyber attackers. Additionally, edge devices often operate with limited computational resources and power, which complicates the implementation of robust security measures. This paper explores the cybersecurity implications of edge computing in the context of data engineering. It begins with a comprehensive review of existing literature to establish the current understanding of edge computing security issues. The review identifies the primary vulnerabilities associated with edge computing, including those related to distributed architecture, data transmission, and resource constraints. Following the literature review, the paper delves into specific security threats that edge computing environments face. These include man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, malware and ransomware, and insider threats. Each threat is analyzed to understand its potential impact on edge computing systems and the data they process."

        "abstract": "Smart grid and cloud computing architectures have been perfectly suiting each other naturally. As a result, over the years cloud computing architectures have dominated the implementations of smart grid applications to address computing needs. However, due to continuing additions of heterogeneous (sensing and actuating) devices, emergence of Internet of Things (IoT), and massive amount of data collected across the grids for analytics, have contributed to the complexity of smart grids, making cloud computing architectures no longer suitable to provide smart grid services effectively. Edge and Fog computing approaches have relieved the cloud computing architectures of problems related to network congestion, latency and locality by shift of control, intelligence and trust to the edge of the network. In this paper, a systematic literature review is used to explore the research trend of the actual implementations of edge and fog computing for smart grid applications. A total of 70 papers were reviewed from the popular digital repositories. The study has revealed that, there is significant increase in the number of smart grid applications that have exploited the use edge and fog computing approaches. The study also shows that, considerable number of the smart grid applications are related to energy optimizations and intelligent coordination of smart grid resources. There are also challenges and issues that hinder smooth adoption of edge and fog computing for smart grid applications, which include security, interoperability and programming models."

However, challenges related to latency, privacy,\nand bandwidth have arisen due to the massive influx of data generated by IoT devices and the limitations of\ntraditional cloud-based architectures. Moreover, network management, interoperability, security, and scalability\nissues have emerged due to the rapid growth and heterogeneous nature of IoT devices. To overcome such\nproblems, researchers proposed a new architecture called Software Defined Networking for Edge Computing in the\nInternet of Things (SDN-EC-IoT), which combines Edge Computing for the Internet of Things (EC-IoT) and\nSoftware Defined Internet of Things (SDIoT). Although researchers have studied EC-IoT and SDIoT as individual\narchitectures, they have not yet addressed the combination of both, creating a significant gap in our understanding\nof SDN-EC-IoT. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive review of how the SDN-EC-IoT\nparadigm can solve IoT challenges. To achieve this goal, this study conducted a literature review covering 74\narticles published between 2019 and 2023. Finally, this paper identifies future research directions for SDN-EC-IoT,\nincluding the development of interoperability platforms, scalable architectures, low latency and Quality of Service\n(QoS) guarantees, efficient handling of big data, enhanced security and privacy, optimized energy consumption,\nresource-aware task offloading, and incorporation of machine learning."

        "abstract": "Green-powered edge computing architectures allow bringing computation in areas that are not reached by the power grids. More often, in applications for Precision Agriculture and Smart Cities, we could have a set of nodes that are coupled with an accumulator which is, during the day, re-charged by the energy harvested by small solar panels. With the latest advances in technology, the edge node is generally assimilated to be a low-power Single Board Computer (SBC), and it is able to carry out even relatively demanding tasks. For example, it can run deep learning models to images or video sequences captured in loco by cameras. However, due to the differences in terms of power consumption and weather conditions, each node experiences a different lifespan, some nodes may even shut down prematurely, causing the interruption of the portion of the deployed service. In this paper, we propose three decentralized algorithms that solve the problem by making the nodes cooperatively balance the traffic in order to level and maximize their lifespan. By comparing the approaches in two different experiments by using a cluster of Raspberry Pi 4 we show that our solutions allow to increase the lifespan of the service of 10% on average wrt the case in which no algorithm is applied."

Combining the recent advents of edge computing (EC) and edge intelligence (EI) with existing advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) has the potential to reduce overall communication cost, preserve user privacy, and provide improved situational awareness. In this paper, we provide an overview for how EC and EI can supplement applications relevant to AMI systems. Additionally, using such systems in tandem can enable distributed deep learning frameworks (e.g., federated learning) to empower distributed data processing and intelligent decision making for AMI. Finally, to demonstrate the efficacy of this considered architecture, we approach the non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) problem using federated learning to train a deep recurrent neural network architecture in a 2-tier and 3-tier manner. In this approach, smart homes locally train a neural network using their metering data and only share the learned model parameters with AMI components for aggregation. Our results show this can reduce communication cost associated with distributed learning, as well as provide an immediate layer of privacy, due to no raw data being communicated to AMI components. Further, we show that FL is able to closely match the model loss provided by standard centralized deep learning where raw data is communicated for centralized training."
