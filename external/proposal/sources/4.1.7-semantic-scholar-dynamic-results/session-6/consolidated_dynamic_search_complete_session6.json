        "abstract": "(English) The sixth-generation (6G) network's evolution necessitates advancements in algorithms and architecture to transition from an AI-native to an intrinsic trustworthy automation-native system. Network slicing creates multiple virtual networks for diverse service requirements and is a crucial technology for future communication systems and 6G networks. This technology will facilitate numerous aspects of life, society, and industry, meeting the communication needs of both humans and intelligent machines. This is made possible by employing softwarization and virtualization technologies, including software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV), to enable the necessary flexibility and programmability required for network slicing. However, the implementation of network slicing in radio access networks (RAN) is challenging due to the complexity of managing RAN operations. This gap is addressed with zero-touch network slicing, a fully automated management and orchestration scheme, which eliminates the need for fixed contracts and manual intervention. The decision engine, a main component of this technology, employs algorithmic innovation to optimize network resource allocation and handle the challenges of RAN slicing, including energy efficiency, latency, scalability, and trustworthiness. In resource allocation, a joint optimization approach is used to balance energy and latency with service quality. A stochastic Actor-Critic approach is proposed to streamline the learning procedure and reduce the need for hyperparameter tuning in an energy-aware network slicing setup. Additionally, a massive deep reinforcement learning-based actor-learner framework is introduced to tackle complexity issues and control challenges in network slicing. The temporal variations of traffic demand pose a significant challenge for resource planning and allocation in the RAN domain. To mitigate this, a distributed architecture for RAN slice resource orchestration is proposed, featuring multiple AI-enabled decision agents that perform local radio allocation decisions without a centralized control entity. A federated learning scheme, aligned with the recent development of the Open RAN architecture, is designed to enhance local decision-making capabilities. Despite AI's effectiveness, concerns persist regarding the lack of transparency in deep neural networks, posing risks to reliability and security in network scenarios. This lack of trust prevents telecommunications operators from widely deploying AI models in their networks. To address this, we proposed SliceOps architecture that consolidates explainable ML operations in a standalone slice, offering AI services to other slices. This setup enhances the reliability and interpretability of AI models, facilitating swift deployment in the network with greater consistency. By transitioning from AI-native to automation-native, this framework manages both service and underlying AI functions, allowing full potential harnessing of slicing in RAN while reducing complexities.\n (Espa\u00f1ol) La evoluci\u00f3n hacia la red de sexta generaci\u00f3n (6G) requiere avances en algoritmos y arquitectura para pasar de un sistema nativo de IA a un sistema nativo de automatizaci\u00f3n intr\u00ednsecamente confiable. El slicing de red crea m\u00faltiples redes virtuales para diversos requisitos de servicio y es una tecnolog\u00eda crucial para los sistemas de comunicaci\u00f3n futuros y las redes 6G. Esta tecnolog\u00eda facilitar\u00e1 numerosos aspectos de la vida, la sociedad y la industria, satisfaciendo las necesidades de comunicaci\u00f3n tanto de humanos como de m\u00e1quinas inteligentes. Esto se hace posible mediante el uso de tecnolog\u00edas de softwarizaci\u00f3n y virtualizaci\u00f3n, incluyendo redes definidas por software (SDN) y virtualizaci\u00f3n de funciones de red (NFV), que dotan la flexibilidad y la programabilidad necesarias para el slicing de red. Sin embargo, la implementaci\u00f3n de slicing de red en las redes de acceso por radio (RAN) es todo un desaf\u00edo debido a la complejidad de gestionar las operaciones en el dominio radio. Esta brecha se aborda con el slicing de red zero-touch, un esquema de gesti\u00f3n y orquestaci\u00f3n totalmente automatizado, que elimina la necesidad de contratos fijos e intervenci\u00f3n manual. El motor de decisiones, un componente principal de esta tecnolog\u00eda, emplea la innovaci\u00f3n algor\u00edtmica para optimizar la asignaci\u00f3n de recursos de la red y manejar los desaf\u00edos del slicing de RAN, incluyendo la eficiencia energ\u00e9tica, la latencia, la escalabilidad y la confiabilidad. En la asignaci\u00f3n de recursos, se utiliza un enfoque de optimizaci\u00f3n conjunta para equilibrar la energ\u00eda y la latencia con la calidad del servicio. En concreto, se propone un enfoque Actor-Cr\u00edtico estoc\u00e1stico para agilizar el procedimiento de aprendizaje y reducir la necesidad de ajustar hiperpar\u00e1metros en una configuraci\u00f3n de slicing de red consciente del consumo energ\u00e9tico. Adem\u00e1s, se introduce un marco de actor-aprendiz basado en un aprendizaje profundo masivo para abordar los problemas de complejidad y los desaf\u00edos de control en el slicing de red. A su vez, las variaciones temporales de la demanda de tr\u00e1fico representan un desaf\u00edo significativo para la planificaci\u00f3n y asignaci\u00f3n de recursos en el dominio de RAN. Para mitigar esto, se propone una arquitectura distribuida para la orquestaci\u00f3n de recursos de slices de RAN, que cuenta con m\u00faltiples agentes de decisi\u00f3n habilitados por IA que materializan decisiones locales de asignaci\u00f3n de radio sin una entidad de control centralizada. Se dise\u00f1a un esquema de aprendizaje federado al respecto, alineado con el reciente desarrollo de la arquitectura Open RAN, para mejorar las capacidades de toma de decisiones locales. A pesar de la efectividad de la IA, persisten las preocupaciones sobre la falta de transparencia en las redes neuronales profundas, lo que supone riesgos para la fiabilidad y la seguridad en los escenarios de red. Esta falta de confianza impide que los operadores de telecomunicaciones desplieguen ampliamente modelos de IA en sus redes. Para abordar esto, propusimos la arquitectura SliceOps que consolida las operaciones de ML explicables en un slice independiente, ofreciendo servicios de IA a otros slices. Esta configuraci\u00f3n mejora la fiabilidad y la interpretabilidad de los modelos de IA, facilitando una implementaci\u00f3n r\u00e1pida en la red con mayor consistencia. Al pasar de ser nativo de IA a nativo de automatizaci\u00f3n, este marco gestiona tanto las funciones de servicio como las subyacentes de IA, permitiendo el aprovechamiento total del slicing en RAN y reduciendo las complejidades."

        "abstract": "Microgrids play a major role in enabling the widespread adoption of renewable distributed energy resources. However, as the power generated from renewable resources is intermittent in nature, it impacts the dynamics and stability of the microgrid, and hence their integration needs new approaches to coordination and control. The existing systems lack run-time adaptive behavior. To face these constraints, the electric energy system must adapt by integrating Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Multiagent system (MAS) is emerging as an integrated solution approach to distributed computing, communication, and data integration needs for smart grid application. Distributed and heterogeneous information can be efficiently processed locally, but utilized globally to coordinate distributed knowledge networks, resulting in reduction of information processing time and network bandwidth. Parallel operations, asynchronous communication, and autonomous actions of agents enable MAS to adapt to dynamic changes of the environment, thereby improving the reliability, responsiveness, fault tolerance, and stability of the microgrid. In this chapter, MAS is implemented with Java Agent DEvelopment (JADE) framework for advanced energy management of a microgrid. Also, MAS is linked with Arduino microcontroller for practical verification of agent operations. Three microgrids are interconnected to form a microgrid testbed, and smart grid features such as demand side management and plug and play are implemented, making it into a smart microgrid."

The algorithm implementation is made using a reactive multi-agent system, which models the electrical grid in terms of autonomous agents which perform the algorithm operations in a distributed and parallel way. To validate this algorithm, two distribution network test models are used: a 15 bus model and a 33 bus model \u2014 standardized by IEEE. The results are obtained by means of computational simulation and shown in this paper, to each one of the network models. The results show that the proposed approach is able to recover all the nodes of the grid, within the simulation conditions. Moreover, it is seen that the multi-agent system directs the work load exactly to the failure point, preventing the involvement of the entire grid to the self-healing process."

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of IoT technology, smart grid, as one of its core applications, is gradually realising the intelligent management of the power system. The popularity of smart meters and other devices enables the grid to monitor power consumption in real time, providing a large amount of data support for grid operations. However, the privacy sensitivity of these data is extremely high, and how to effectively protect user privacy has become an important challenge for the development of smart grid. To address this problem, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme based on proxy reencryption, which aims to ensure the privacy and security of user data without sacrificing data utility. The secure collection and processing of data is achieved by constructing a multi-layer system model containing a trusted centre, a control centre, a fog node and a smart meter. It enables the data to complete aggregation and conversion in an encrypted state, effectively preventing unauthorised access and data leakage. At the same time, the solution supports bidirectional selective aggregation, allowing the system to flexibly perform data aggregation operations according to demand, improving system applicability and efficiency. Security analysis and performance evaluation show that the scheme proposed in this paper is effective in protecting user privacy and system security."

The current state of transition is characterized by dynamic and swift alterations, necessitating the utilization of numerous sophisticated approaches to effectively analyze the substantial volume of data produced by diverse entities. In this particular context, SG is closely associated with AI as an emerging technology that aim to establish a decentralized and intelligent energy paradigm. Artificial intelligence is intended to enhance the level of intelligence in both supervisory and operational decision-making processes. This article provides a comprehensive introduction to AI techniques and methods, followed by a detailed examination of how they are applied in the context of SG and microgrid (MG) systems. This analysis is conducted through a comprehensive examination of more than 90 recent scholarly articles. The aim of this paper is to enhance the reader\u2019s comprehension regarding the potentials of AI within the context of SG and MG."

As the global adoption of smart grid and digital power infrastructure accelerates, the role of AI becomes increasingly significant in optimizing operations like forecasting, maintenance, and energy distribution. Despite several works in the literature relating to ethical AI in domains like medicine and agriculture, a framework and recommendation are missing from the power grid lens. This study introduces a framework of ethical principles tailored to the smart grid context. Through this framework, we identify key methods and strategies, present case studies, and discuss challenges associated with ethical AI implementation in smart grids. Our research reveals a constant tug-of-war: while AI can revolutionize how grids operate; we can't ignore the risks of prioritizing efficiency over fairness. We also discuss significant challenges and outline future research directions for ethical AI use in power grid systems."

Nonetheless, traditional modeling, optimization, and control methods encounter numerous limitations in handling such data effectively. As a result, the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques within the smart grid is gaining prominence. This survey systematically reviews existing research on various AI techniques applied to load forecasting, power grid stability assessment, fault detection, and security issues within the smart grid and power systems. Furthermore, it identifies ongoing research challenges in implementing AI technologies to achieve truly intelligent grid systems. Finally, this survey highlights the potential applications of AI in addressing smart grid challenges. Ultimately, the paper concludes that integrating AI techniques can significantly enhance the reliability and resilience of smart grid systems."

        "abstract": "During the operation of smart grid, the data of power production, transmission and consumption will be recorded (Liu et al., 2023). With the rapid development of information technology, the data volume shows an explosive growth trend (Zhou et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2017; Ahmad et al., 2020). The explosive growth of data has brought challenges to power monitoring and data transmission to a certain extent, and also restricted the development of smart grid to a certain extent. The development of smart grid requires scientific methods to optimize the configuration of data, deeply analyze the massive data stored in it, and use big data technology to effectively mine, analyze, transform and store unstructured data, so as to make the smart grid develop more directionally and achieve the goal of scientific and sustainable development (Srikantha and Kundur, 2019; Rituraj et al., 2022). Many AI technologies have important reference value in the smart grid planning, prediction, intelligent monitoring, intelligent control, auxiliary decision-making, equipment inspection, fault diagnosis and other application scenarios of the modern energy systems. Neural network, expert system, data mining and other technologies have their advantages and disadvantages and application scope. In the application, attention should be paid to the scientific selection of various technologies, and the correction and maintenance of reliability, interpretability, data sample accumulation, infrastructure preparation, and knowledge base, so as to be well prepared for potential challenges in the 21st century. This Research Topic aims to provide a platform to promote state-of-the-art research methods and results in data-driven methods and applications for smart grid, such as: Energy Prediction, Fault Diagnosis, Equipment Inspection, Intelligent Dispatch, and Stability Assessment, etc. It is hoped that this series of articles can provide valuable references for academic researchers and power industry engineers in related fields.

Traditional modelling, optimization, and control technologies, on the other hand, have several limits in specifics processing; hence, the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in the smart grid are becoming increasingly obvious. This study provides a systematic analysis of current study into several typical Artificial Intelligence approaches used in smart grid and load prognosticate of power system, stability evaluation of power grid, detection of fault, and security challenges. It also poses additional research hurdles for deploying AI technology to fully smart grid systems. Lastly, this study discusses the possibilities for implementing AI to smart grid concerns. According to the report, the use of AI approaches can increase and improve the dependability and flexibility of intelligent grid systems."

As power grid systems rapidly evolve to meet the increasing energy demands and the new requirements of renewable source integration, DTs offer promising solutions to enhance the monitoring, control, and optimization of these systems. In this paper, we examine the concept of DTs in the context of smart grids, and their requirements, challenges, and integration with the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). We also discuss different applications in asset management, system operation, and disaster response. This paper analyzes current challenges, including data management, interoperability, cost, and ethical considerations. Through case studies from various sectors in Canada, we illustrate the real-world implementation and impact of DTs. Finally, we discuss emerging trends and future directions, highlighting the potential of DTs to revolutionize smart grid networks and contribute to more efficient, reliable, and sustainable power systems."

Large Language Models (LLMs) are the latest solution for AI-capable Industry 4.0 management. The trustworthiness of the LLMs is an important issue in the management of such systems. In this paper, the behaviors of various locally-hosted LLMs in managing unauthorized operations within smart grids are investigated. To highlight the advantages of local-hosting, we also compare the performance of these models with online LLMs. Our findings show that locally-hosted LLMs perform better in preventing vulnerabilities than their online counterparts. This study proposes an educational platform for future generations of smart grid operators and provides guidelines for teaching the vulnerabilities of LLM prompting needed to be included in the educational curriculum of the smart grid management workforce. Furthermore, the findings of this research can provide guidelines for standardization, legislation and regulations of AI applications in smart grids."

However, due to a very large number of entities within organizational access control (AC) systems, static RBAC management can be inefficient, costly, and can lead to cybersecurity threats. In this article, a novel hybrid RBAC model is proposed, based on the principles of offline deep reinforcement learning (RL) and Bayesian belief networks. The considered framework utilizes a fully offline RL agent, which models the behavioral history of users as a Bayesian belief-based trust indicator. Thus, the initial static RBAC policy is improved in a dynamic manner through off-policy learning while guaranteeing compliance of the internal users with the security rules of the system. By deploying our implementation within the smart grid domain and specifically within a Distributed Energy Resources (DER) ecosystem, we provide an end-to-end proof of concept of our model. Finally, detailed analysis and evaluation regarding the offline training phase of the RL agent are provided, while the online deployment of the hybrid RL-based RBAC model into the DER ecosystem highlights its key operation features and salient benefits over traditional RBAC models."

This study systematically reviews new challenges and research trends in the field of smart grid optimization, focusing on key issues such as power flow optimization, load scheduling, and reactive power compensation. By analyzing the application of reinforcement learning in the smart grid, the impact of distributed new energy\u2019s high penetration on the stability of the system is thoroughly discussed, and the advantages and disadvantages of the existing control strategies are systematically reviewed. This study compares the applicability, advantages, and limitations of different reinforcement learning algorithms in practical scenarios, and reveals core challenges such as state space complexity, learning stability, and computational efficiency. On this basis, a multi-agent cooperation optimization direction based on the two-layer reinforcement learning framework is proposed to improve the dynamic coordination ability of the power grid. This study provides a theoretical reference for smart grid optimization through multi-dimensional analysis and research, advancing the application of deep reinforcement learning technology in this field."

In this study, we develop and deploy a reinforcement learning (RL)-based \u2018smart planning agent\u2019 capable of designing alternative decentralized water systems under demanding operational contexts. The agent's aim is to identify optimal water infrastructure configurations (i.e., proposed decisions on water management options and interventions) for different conditions with regard to climate, occupancy and water technology availability in a demanding, off-grid setting, i.e., a water system with high requirements of independence from centralized infrastructure. The agent is coupled with a source-to-tap water cycle simulation model (Urban Water Optioneering Tool, UWOT) capable of assessing and stress-testing the proposed configurations under different conditions. The approach is demonstrated in the case of a military camp deployed abroad for peacekeeping operations. The agent is tasked with selecting optimal interventions from an array of real-world camp water management technologies and evaluating their efficiency under highly variable, operational conditions explored through simulation. The results show that RL can be a useful addition to the arsenal of decision support systems (DSS) for distributed water system planning and management, especially under challenging, highly variable conditions."

        "abstract": "The application of artificial intelligence in smart grid operations, particularly for defect detection, has seen remarkable progress. However, effectively leveraging multi\u2010modal data sources to enhance defect detection performance remains challenging. This paper presents a novel Knowledge Graph\u2010based Multimodal Neural Network (KGMNN) approach for robust and efficient defect detection in smart grids. Our proposed method first leverages multiple heterogeneous data sources, such as structural data, temporal sensor readings, and maintenance records, creating a comprehensive representation of the grid system. The system is then modeled as a knowledge graph, with nodes representing various entities and edges signifying their interconnections and interactions. This paper introduces a novel neural network architecture that effectively leverages the knowledge graph structure. This architecture incorporates multi\u2010modal fusion techniques, enabling the model to process and integrate diverse data sources. It can recognize intricate patterns indicative of potential defects that are often undetectable in individual data modes. Experimental results on several real\u2010world smart grid datasets demonstrate that the KGMNN significantly outperforms state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art techniques in terms of precision, recall, and computational efficiency. Furthermore, the KGMNN's ability to provide explainable predictions, aided by the inherent interpretability of the knowledge graph structure, is of significant practical value in the field. This research paves the way for a new generation of AI\u2010powered defect detection in smart grids, facilitating enhanced grid reliability and operational efficiency."

However, the traditional modeling, optimization, and control technologies have many limitations in processing the data; thus, the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in the smart grid are becoming more apparent. This survey presents a structured review of the existing research into some common AI techniques applied to load forecasting, power grid stability assessment, faults detection, and security problems in the smart grid and power systems. It also provides further research challenges for applying AI technologies to realize truly smart grid systems. Finally, this survey presents opportunities of applying AI to smart grid problems. The paper concludes that the applications of AI techniques can enhance and improve the reliability and resilience of smart grid systems."

This paper presents a comprehensive framework leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to orchestrate DER operations, thus achieving optimized load balancing and grid stability. A multi-agent system that utilizes machine learning algorithms is proposed, capable of predictive analytics and real-time decision-making. The architecture is underpinned by a robust data layer that assimilates inputs from a myriad of sensors and smart meters, facilitating the dynamic management of DERs. Through the simulation of various scenarios, the system demonstrates significant improvements in load distribution, peak shaving, and voltage regulation. The framework also showcases resilience against fluctuations and anomalies, attributing to the self-learning capability of AI models that continuously refine control strategies. The adaptability of the system is evaluated in the context of grid demand-response initiatives and the integration of intermittent renewable energy sources. Overall, the results indicate a substantial advancement in the operational efficiency of power grids, highlighting the synergy between AI and energy resource management."

        "abstract": "With the increasing integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) in the power grid, a decentralized approach becomes essential for scheduling and allocation of resources in a smart grid. Economic Dispatch (ED) and Unit Commitment (UC) are the two major resource allocation problems that play critical role in the safe and stable operation of a grid system. The uncertainty associated with renewable energy sources have made the resource allocation problems even more challenging for grid operators. The future grid will have a higher generation mix of renewable energy sources and a large load of Electrical vehicles, with the possibility of bi-directional power flow. This complex smart grid system necessitates the development of a decentralized approach to resource allocation problem, which allows inter-node communication and decision making. Multi-agent systems (MAS) is a promising platform to decentralize the traditional centralized resource allocation aspects of smart grid. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on the application of MAS to Economic Dispatch (ED) and Unit Commitment (UC) in smart grids."

        "abstract": "To address climatic change and reduce carbon emissions, the usage of non-conventional resources like solar and wind, are rapidly increasing every day. Depend on the irregularity of the nature, there are some challenges in Electrical grids, for maintaining supply consistency and balancing the grid stability. To overcome the challenges, power storage systems (PSS) play an important role due to the preserve extra energy generated during their peak time of low demand and deliver it when the power supply demand is high. This capability maintains grid flexibility by providing a reliable energy supply. Recent advancements in PSS technologies, including battery storage systems, flywheel batteries, supercapacitors, hydrogen storage, and hybrid energy storage systems (HESS), aim to improve essential Qualities like energy capacity, efficiency, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, making these systems more available for extensive implementation. The AI and ML applications used for present energy management allow flexibility in power grid operations. Additionally, hydrogen storage combined with fuel cells is emerging as a promising long-term solution. To manage seasonal variations energy backup systems, play a crucial role by preserving extra energy during the time of peak generation and delivering it when the power generation is less in renewable energy. Moreover, an innovative approach for energy optimization in the smart grids by integrating electric vehicles (EVs) used as mobile energy buffers and to enhance overall grid flexibility, when non-conventional power production is less. EVs will store energy and supply it back to the network during peak time and two-way operating through the power from grid to vehicle. This review highlights the essential roles, of ESS and EVs in smoothing the development of low-carbon, sustainable energy systems, particularly smart grids designed to maximize renewable energy combinations while assuring grid stability."

        "abstract": "5G networks will provide services for a wealth of vertical industry applications, bringing more demand for edge services. Multi-access edge computing (MEC) is one of the important technologies of 5G. By providing an information technology service environment and cloud computing capabilities close to the mobile users, it can better support low-latency and high-bandwidth services in 5G networks. This paper constructs an AI capability center based on 5G MEC, which can provide rich AI services for smart grids. The center supports the dynamic construction and operation of the intelligent data analysis application, and realizes the rapid development and flexible deployment of the business analysis process, which could improve the interaction and response time of the business analysis process. Based on AI algorithm capabilities, we focus on the typical cases of artificial intelligence service applications in smart grid e.g., monitoring of electrical equipment based on similar audio recognition. We describe the applications of artificial intelligence technology in various business scenarios from the perspective of application scenario, application scheme, algorithm principle and practice effect. The applications have been put in use and obtained good application effect."

        "abstract": "The growing success of smart grids (SGs) is driving increased interest in load forecasting (LF) as accurate predictions of energy demand are crucial for ensuring the reliability, stability, and efficiency of SGs. LF techniques aid SGs in making decisions related to power operation and planning upgrades, and can help provide efficient and reliable power services at fair prices. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), specifically in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), have also played a significant role in improving the precision of demand forecasting. It is important to evaluate different LF techniques to identify the most accurate and appropriate one for use in SGs. This paper conducts a systematic review of state-of-the-art forecasting techniques, including traditional techniques, clustering-based techniques, AI-based techniques, and time series-based techniques, and provides an analysis of their performance and results. The aim of this paper is to determine which LF technique is most suitable for specific applications in SGs. The findings indicate that AI-based LF techniques, using ML and neural network (NN) models, have shown the best forecast performance compared to other methods, achieving higher overall root mean squared (RMS) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values."

        "abstract": "Due to the modern power system\u2019s rapid development, more scattered smart grid components are securely linked into the power system by encircling a wide electrical power network with the underpinning communication system. By enabling a wide range of applications, such as distributed energy management, system state forecasting, and cyberattack security, these components generate vast amounts of data that automate and improve the efficiency of the smart grid. Due to traditional computer technologies\u2019 inability to handle the massive amount of data that smart grid systems generate, AI-based alternatives have received a lot of interest. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) will be specifically developed in this study to address this issue by incorporating the adaptively time-developing energy system\u2019s attributes to enhance the model of the dynamic properties of contemporary Smart Grid (SG) that are impacted by Revised Encoding Scheme (RES) or system reconfiguration to differentiate LSTM changes & real-time threats. More specifically, we provide a federated instructional strategy for consumer sharing of power data to Power Grid (PG) that is supported by edge clouds, protects consumer privacy, and is communication-efficient. They then design two optimization problems for Energy Data Owners (EDO) and energy service operations, as well as a local information assessment method in Federated Learning (FL) by taking non-independent and identically distributed (IID) effects into consideration. The test results revealed that LSTM had a longer training duration, four hidden levels, and higher training loss than other models. The provided method works incredibly well in several situations to identify FDIA. The suggested approach may successfully induce EDOs to employ high-quality local models, increase the payout of the ESP, and decrease task latencies, according to extensive simulations, which are the last points. According to the verification results, every assault sample could be effectively recognized utilizing the current detection methods and the LSTM RNN-based structure created by Smart."

        "abstract": "Agent-based computing and multi-agent systems are important tools in the domain of smart grid. Various properties of agents like self-organization, co-operation, autonomous behavior, and many others allow researchers to well represent the smart grid applications and models. From past few decades, various research attempts have been made in the smart grid domain by adopting the agent-based computing technology. The research publications are growing in number which makes it difficult to locate and identify the dynamics and trends in the research. Scientometric analysis is a useful tool to perform a comprehensive bibliographic review. It allows not only to understand the key areas of research but also provide visual representation of each entity involve in the research. In this study, we provide a detailed statistical as well as visual analysis of agent-based smart grid research by adopting complex network-based analytical approach. The study covers all scientific literature available online in Web of Science database. We are interested in identification of key papers, authors, and journals. Furthermore, we also investigate core countries, institutions, and categories."

        "abstract": "Stable operations of modern power networks depend on the reliability of smart grids. The expansion of modern power systems combined with renewable energy applications and decentralized networks creates difficulties for traditional fault detection methods because of high-dimensional data combined with measurement noise and delayed fault identification processes. A deep learning solution based on Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) image data detection for smart grid faults is presented in this work. The proposed method achieves accurate and efficient fault classification through the conversion of PMU data to images and then utilization of advanced deep learning models VGG16 combined with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The experimental findings show that VGG16 reaches 98.75% accuracy in fault classification while surpassing CNNs that delivered 94.44% accuracy. In addition to reporting high classification accuracy, the study proposes a new hybrid deep learning framework that combines transfer learning and adaptive thresholding techniques. The image-based deep learning system extracts features automatically, reducing the need for human preprocessing to effectively detect fault patterns. The methodology enables immediate fault detection, allowing operators to make critical decisions to avoid major power outages. According to the research, artificial intelligence has the potential to significantly improve smart grid resilience, reduce economic losses, and improve power system operational efficiency. The research advances AI developments in energy management by developing advanced, powerful fault detection methods that will guide future changes to power system networks."

        "abstract": "This research aims at developing methodological tools for decision makers (DMs) to determine the locations for generating sites for hybrid renewable energy systems, considering complementarity characteristics of the corresponding sources and their seasonal availability. The decision process on new sites starts using Geographic Information Systems for modeling relevant spatial criteria. The problem solution is associated with using the Slide-OWA operator, which permits one to control the inter-criteria compensation levels by adjusting pessimism and optimism parameters. After constructing multicriteria estimates for generating sites, the general scheme of multi-objective decision-making is applied in conditions of uncertainty since these estimates are subject to significant levels of uncertainty. Such a scheme is based on the possibilistic approach, which involves the construction of payoff matrices. At this point, it is possible that some alternatives cannot be distinguished based only on the criteria considered so far, or the DM may want to evaluate the alternatives from the point of view of additional considerations. For this purpose, the framework of multi-attribute decision-making models is applied by employing methods for preference modeling in a fuzzy environment. The present work results are applied to a case study of the Minas Gerais State in Brazil. These results play a strategic role for governments and investors in their decisions while considering the ability to meet a wide range of criteria."

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Hand weeding is a common method of weed control on vegetable farms, especially in developing countries. It requires considerable physical labour and is a significant economic burden, yet comparative studies on hand weeding tools are rare. We evaluated the agronomic, ergonomic and economic performance of four hand weeding tools (and unweeded control) at two sites and two weed ages. Agronomic efficiency was evaluated based on the reduction in weed load from pre-weeding to post-weeding, economic efficiency based on the time taken to weed, and ergonomic efficiency based on heart rate and energy expenditure of the tool operator. Among the tools, the chipping hoe provided higher weed control efficiency than the rotating hoe and combined tool, and showed a lower average heart rate and workload than the combined tool. Ergonomic performance was superior in loam soil compared with clay. The light-weight chipping hoe provided better weed control than heavier tools while also reducing the workload of the weeder. Tools did not differ in economic performance, but the cost was 50% higher with late weeding. Viable hand weeding strategies require the optimization of tools for ergonomic performance and careful attention to timing of operations, thus benefiting economic performance. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT"

This paper presents a real life Demand Response campaign carried out by the local Distribution System Operator to reduce the Reverse Power Flow caused by the increasing amount of energy produced locally by distributed generators from not programmable energy sources. Innovative near-real time smart meters and advanced software developed under the Nobel GRID and the WiseGRID projects were used for the trial. Furthermore, these findings and actual data have been used for running simulations at the primary substation level for a complete year. The encouraging results obtained, especially when large energy consumers are involved, have shown the effectiveness of these tools and how they can enable the Distribution System Operator to use Demand Response strategies for increasing grid efficiency and control."

        "abstract": "In theory, building automation and management systems (BAMSs) can provide all the components and functionalities required for analyzing and operating buildings. However, in reality, these systems can only ensure the control of heating ventilation and air conditioning system systems. Therefore, many other tasks are left to the operator, e.g. evaluating buildings\u2019 performance, detecting abnormal energy consumption, identifying the changes needed to improve efficiency, ensuring the security and privacy of end-users, etc. To that end, there has been a movement for developing artificial intelligence (AI) big data analytic tools as they offer various new and tailor-made solutions that are incredibly appropriate for practical buildings\u2019 management. Typically, they can help the operator in (i) analyzing the tons of connected equipment data; and; (ii) making intelligent, efficient, and on-time decisions to improve the buildings\u2019 performance. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic survey on using AI-big data analytics in BAMSs. It covers various AI-based tasks, e.g. load forecasting, water management, indoor environmental quality monitoring, occupancy detection, etc. The first part of this paper adopts a well-designed taxonomy to overview existing frameworks. A comprehensive review is conducted about different aspects, including the learning process, building environment, computing platforms, and application scenario. Moving on, a critical discussion is performed to identify current challenges. The second part aims at providing the reader with insights into the real-world application of AI-big data analytics. Thus, three case studies that demonstrate the use of AI-big data analytics in BAMSs are presented, focusing on energy anomaly detection in residential and office buildings and energy and performance optimization in sports facilities. Lastly, future directions and valuable recommendations are identified to improve the performance and reliability of BAMSs in intelligent buildings."

        "abstract": "A number of non-linear dynamic responses require analysis with an increased resolution in their time domain representation, especially the ones presenting abrupt changes, such as those caused by the introduction of cracks, gaps, and slip. Typical technological applications include bearings or gears with localized defects. Since the time resolution of well-known time-frequency analysis tools (such as Wavelet-Transform) presents limitations, the Energy Operator Separation Algorithm (EOSA) is considered. The algorithm is based on the Teager-Kaiser nonlinear differential energy operator and leads to the calculation of the instantaneous amplitude and frequency of the response. Compared to the Hilbert transform, it leads at least to the same estimation errors, but in addition presents smaller computational complexity and faster adaptation, due to its instantaneous nature. The EOSA is applied on responses of a nonlinear Van der-Pol oscillator, on signals simulating the dynamic response of defective rolling element bearings and on three signals measured at industrial installations, resulting from defective bearings. In all cases the algorithm leads to the efficient calculation, mainly of the instantaneous amplitude of the signals. However, certain improvements are necessary in order to increase the smoothness, mainly of the resulting instantaneous frequency time waveforms.Copyright \u00a9 2009 by ASME"

Without the technology for harnessing EV charging to the benefit of the grid, there will be no market for grid services and little impact for aggregators. This paper provides systematic approaches for Vehicle-Grid Integrated microgrid planning. Several tools from governments and commercial simulation packages including Interruption Cost Estimate (ICE) Calculator, PVWatts, Storage Value Estimation Tool (StorageVETTM), Electrical Transient Analyzer Program (ETAP), and Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS), are used to verify the design requirements and simulate the electric load changes using smart charging and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G). The simulation results showed that load shaping by smart charging and V2G fattened undesirable ramps and halved the system\u2019s peak load, which can be translated to significant cost savings for the grid operator."

Many power systems around the world are facing similar challenges. This article outlines the experience of five system operators that are already undergoing this transition, namely, Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), Australia; EirGrid, Ireland; Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii, USA; National Grid (NG) Electricity System Operator (ESO), United Kingdom; and Fingrid, Finland. Although the experiences presented in this article are for country-specific power systems, the experiences can be applied to other power systems."

This locational problem has a complex nature and its solution has to be capable to take into account a wide range of considerations, as well as evaluations of a qualitative character. In this sense, the proposed process of elaborating decisions starts with studies related to the spatial criteria, which are modeled and processed within the Spatial Multicriteria Analysis. The relative importance of the spatial criteria is established by the involved experts on the basis of the construction, transformation, and processing of preference relations within the framework of the Analytic Hierarchy Process. The resulting decision maps are generated by aggregating the spatial criteria, applying the Ordered Weighted Averaging operator and the linguistic quantifiers. These maps permit one to highlight rational solution alternatives, which, if necessary, are evaluated, compared, chosen, prioritized, and/or ordered, applying additional spatial criteria (of quantitative as well as qualitative character), by means of techniques for preference modeling in a fuzzy environment (within the framework of so-called $< X,R>$ models). The corresponding decision process permits one to take into account and process quantitative and qualitative spatial criteria as well as preferences and judgments of the experts. The paper results are illustrated by a Case Study related to the determination of the most suitable locational alternatives for renewable power plants in the Minas Gerais state, Brazil."

        "abstract": "Optimal planning of power distribution systems with local resources is crucial to meet energy demand and avoid disruptions in energy supply for consumers. This requires the system operators to manage available resources and utilize suitable risk management tools to control and study uncertainties and their potential consequences. This paper proposes an uncertainty-based optimization framework based on the robust optimization and scenario methodology for optimal sizing and siting of electrical vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). The proposed model seeks to take advantage of the flexibility introduced by EVCSs and gain financial profit for the operator of the power distribution system through reducing power losses and offering services to electricity markets. To handle the uncertainties posed by different resources, two risk measures are employed simultaneously. The uncertainty originating from the state of charge (SOC) of electric vehicles (EVs) is addressed through stochastic programming, while the robust optimization method (ROM) enables the operator of the power distribution system to be informed of the consequences of uncertainty in electricity load. Therefore, appropriate strategies can be taken to tackle the uncertainties while keeping the system operation stable and gaining financial profit. Thus, three strategies are studied in the proposed model as follows: risk-neutral, risk-averse, and risk-taker. In addition, the non-linear terms in power flow modeling were linearized through a set of linear functions which transforms the proposed model to a MILP problem. The IEEE 33-bus test system under different levels of load uncertainty and considering the uncertainty in SOC of EVs is utilized to ensure the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results highlight the efficiency of the proposed model in considering uncertainties and taking advantage of the consideration of different risk attitudes by the decision-maker that ROM provides for the optimal operation of the power distribution system."

We exploit the vulnerability of a near-transition QMB state against the parameter shift for devising efficient sensing tools. In this realm the main focus of this work is to identify, propose and analyze experimentally relevant quantum observables for precision measurement. Taking a QMB system as a Fermi lattice under quasi-periodic modulation that supports an energy-independent delocalization-localization transition, we suggest operator-based adiabatic and dynamical quantum sensors endowed with considerable quantum advantages."

        "abstract": "In October 2013, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) finalized procurement targets and other requirements to its jurisdictional utilities for a minimum of 1,325 MW of 'viable and cost-effective' energy storage systems by 2020. The goal of this study is to explore several aspects of grid operations in California and the Western Interconnection resulting from meeting the CPUC storage targets. We perform this analysis using a set of databases and grid simulation tools developed and implemented by the CPUC, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), and the California Energy Commission (CEC) for the CPUC's Long-term Procurement Plan (LTPP). The 2014 version of this database contains information about generators, storage, transmission, and electrical demand, for California in the year 2024 for both 33% and 40% renewable energy portfolios. We examine the value of various services provided by energy storage in these scenarios. Sensitivities were performed relating to the services energy storage can provide, the capacity and duration of storage devices, export limitations, and negative price floor variations. Results show that a storage portfolio, as outlined by the CPUC, can reduce curtailment and system-wide production costs for 33% and 40% renewable scenarios. A storage device that can participate in energy and ancillarymore\u00a0\u00bb service markets provides the grid with the greatest benefit; the mandated storage requirement of 1,325 MW was estimated to reduce the total cost of production by about 78 million per year in the 33% scenario and 144 million per year in the 40% scenario. Much of this value is derived from the avoided start and stop costs of thermal generators and provision of ancillary services. A device on the 2024 California grid and participating in only ancillary service markets can provide the system with over 90% of the value as the energy and ancillary service device. The analysis points to the challenge of new storage providing regulation reserve, as the added storage could provide about 75% of the regulation up requirement for all of California, which would likely greatly reduce regulation prices and potential revenue. The addition of storage in California decreases renewable curtailment, particularly in the 40% RPS case. Following previous analysis, storage has a mixed impact on emissions, generally reducing emissions, but also creating additional incentives for increased emissions from out-of-state coal generations. Overall, storage shows significant system cost savings, but analysis also points to additional challenges associated with full valuation of energy storage, including capturing the operational benefits calculated here, but also recovering additional benefits associated avoided generation, transmission, and distribution capacity, and avoided losses.\u00ab\u00a0less"

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel short-time optimization method based on a resiliency enhancement strategy for a smart distribution network during adverse weather conditions. The key idea is to integrate various electric vehicles (EVs) with different behaviour patterns and other distributed energy resources into emergency tools of distribution network operation such as topology reconfiguration and grid-supported services. In this regard, possible management programs for three types of EVs (with different levels of control potentials), energy resources, reconfiguration, and demand response programs impacts on boosting resiliency are investigated. The framework is organized on coordination and benefit sharing among distribution system operator (DSO), private sector, and EV owners to reduce possible side effects of failures that could be incepted by extreme weather conditions. A Monte Carlo-based stochastic simulation for modelling uncertainties such as EVs movement, state of change, arrival/departure time to charge stations, and weather-based failures is devised. In order to evaluate resiliency, metrics based on a multiphase method are analysed. The performance of the proposed method on extra benefit obtaining for DSO and private sector and also resiliency enhancement in disturbance progress, postdisturbance degraded, and restorative state are carried out on IEEE-33 bus test system, and obtained results are analysed in detail."

Geothermal power plants (GPP) are even ogled as a renewable energy source that has a lot of potential worldwide. Technology for GPP continues to evolve. However, tools for analyzing a system of GPP are still inadequate. In this study, a simple analysis tool was designed. The usefulness of this analysis tool is to be able to know the state of the GPP works. This tool will help simulate the conditions that may occur in the plant system. The simulation results will also be known operating conditions that may occur, so the operator can determine what should be done if things happen. Modeling started using Microsoft Excel, which has been equipped with thermodynamic properties. Modeling includes turbine, condenser, cooling tower, and extraction systems non-condensable gas. After validated, the model run simulation in variations that may occur such as decline in the condition of the condenser and cooling tower and environmental conditions, represented by relative humidity. The simulation with variation of condition will decrease the power generated from turbine 3 \u2013 5%."

        "abstract": "The microgrid is a local power provider with advanced control tools. The capacity of energy resources is not so high in a microgrid and cannot be treated as a slack bus. Hence, the power flow problem must be solved regardless of the presence of a slack bus. Power flow analysis plays a vitally important role in the design, planning, and operation of electricity networks. Unlike traditional load flow methods, optimal load flow can be a practical supporting tool for the operator to overcome problems in the planning, operation, and control of power systems at transmission and distribution levels. Conventional load flow methods cannot be used in island mode. In this paper, the Gorilla Troop Optimizer (GTO) method is employed to optimize the load flow method for renewable microgrids in the island mode. A hybrid objective function is also proposed to minimize the absolute value of the mean voltage phase error and the voltage amplitude, as well as to minimize the total absolute value of the mismatch of the active and reactive power. The simulation results of the studied system show that the proposed objective function can be used to improve various indicators. Moreover, the results convey that the GTO method has provided better performance than other optimization methods."

The technical issue is the L2(\u03a3)-regularity of the boundary \u2192 boundary operator B\u2217L for (multidimensional) hyperbolic and Petrowski-type mixed PDEs problems, where L is the boundary input \u2192 interior solution operator and B is the control operator from the boundary. Both positive and negative classes of \ndistinctive PDE illustrations are exhibited and proved. The larger case to be made is that hard analysis PDE energy methods are the tools of the trade\u0097not soft analysis methods. This holds true not only to analyze B\u2217L, but also to establish three inter-related cardinal results: optimal PDE regularity, exact controllability, and uniform stabilization. Thus, the paper takes a critical view on a spate of \u0093abstract\u0094 results in \u0093infinite-dimensional systems theory,\u0094 generated by unnecessarily complicated and highly limited \u0093soft\u0094 methods, with no apparent awareness of the high degree of restriction of the abstract assumptions made\u0097far from necessary\u0097as well as on how to verify them in the case of multidimensional dynamical systems such as PDEs."

        "abstract": "The technological advance of the XXI century provides several benefits to the electrical grid. Such benefits are not limited to new electrical assets, also technologies developed for other fields may become key tools. A clear example is artificial intelligence (AI), which is fundamental to the processing of the data being generated nowadays. Therefore, a potential application of AI in the electrical grid is the predictive maintenance of medium voltage cable joints. These accessories are one of the main causes of fault in the distribution network, resulting in significant economic losses and energy not supplied to the customers. In this paper, a realistic scenario is designed to produce data for a typical machine learning (ML) algorithm. In detail, the main fault modes of cable joints and the associated parameters are defined. Afterwards, the ML algorithm is tested and validated considering its realistic implementation by a distribution system operator. From the results, it is possible to appreciate (i) the applicability and the effectiveness of the algorithm for the predictive maintenance of cable joints; (ii) the discussion on the pros and cons of the use of ML algorithms; (iii) some hints to better exploit the algorithm in practical applications."

        "abstract": "The massive penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in distribution networks provides a strategic opportunity for the distribution system operator (DSO) to coordinate the assets appropriately and offer services to the transmission systems. The IEEE std. 1547-2018 introduced a control mechanism to enable the power electronic converters (PECs) to offer several services, including voltage regulation by controlling the reactive power injection/absorption; this type of PECs is also known as \"smart inverter\". The participation of the smart-inverters in the voltage regulation with a novel customer-centred piece of legislation and markets provide the DSO with powerful tools to enforce very positive TSO/DSO interactions. This research paper presents a comprehensive assessment of the steady-state performance provided by voltage control at the smart-inverters to the TSO \u2013 DSO system. The assessment includes analysing main indicators using time series considering short term (24-hours, 1-minute resolution) and long-term (one-year) horizon. In this paper, the three leading indicators are used as criteria for the assessment: total energy losses voltage profile in the TSO-DSO system and the power flow interaction at the interface between the systems. The assessment is based on numerical results using the DIgSILENT PowerFactory simulation tool, where the voltage controllers have been implemented, and regional electrical system in south-eastern Norway, the area of Vestfold and Telemark as been used for illustrative purposes"

For every open set in spacetime and choice of two states, the modular theory defines a positive operator known as the relative modular operator that decreases monotonically under restriction to subregions. We study the consequences of this operator monotonicity inequality for correlation functions in quantum field theory. We do so by constructing a one-parameter R\u00e9nyi family of information-theoretic measures from the relative modular operator that inherit monotonicity by construction and reduce to correlation functions in special cases. In the case of finite quantum systems, this R\u00e9nyi family is the sandwiched R\u00e9nyi divergence and we obtain a simple proof of its monotonicity. Its monotonicity implies a class of constraints on correlation functions in quantum field theory, only a small set of which were known to us. We explore these inequalities for free fields and conformal field theory. We conjecture that the second null derivative of R\u00e9nyi divergence is non-negative which is a generalization of the quantum null energy condition to the R\u00e9nyi family."
