The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) enables intelligent predictive maintenance in smart manufacturing by incorporating IoT technologies, Big Data techniques, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and other ever-developing enabling technologies. Although a large body of research has been conducted on IIoT based predictive maintenance, most work focuses on addressing only a part of the problem. However, predictive maintenance involves an ecosystem from ingesting data from sensors to displaying the results on a dashboard for engineers to visualize. With increasing requirements for real-time responses and privacy, integrating edge computing is no doubt a promising trend. This article proposes a complete and optimized IoT Big Data ecosystem embedded into a three-layer architecture for predictive maintenance applications. The proposed architecture consists of an edge layer, a cloud layer, and an application layer. The proposed edge infrastructure distributes the tasks effectively between the cloud layer and edge layer. On top of the architecture, different layers are integrated seamlessly to address reliability and scalability issues. In addition, an edge computing-assisted autoencoder is introduced and enabled by being deployed in a distributed manner to improve both performance and efficiency. For practical interest, we also provide an application programming interface-oriented implementation guideline for readers. To verify the proposed ecosystem, a real case study from industry is conducted to demonstrate the performance gain of edge computing-based Internet of Things systems in conjunction with the autoencoder-based deep learning technique.
