      "abstract": "This paper aims to review the current trends and use of machine learning (ML) models in the predictive maintenance of IT infrastructure, especially cloud computing and DevOps ecosystems. The objective is to foresee systemic risks and guard against their occurrence by reviewing operational data and establishing succeeding patterns of poor system performance. Experiments are performed with accurate logs of system and service activities from a cloud service provider. At the same time, the developed ML models were established to provide reasonably accurate estimates of failures, hence minimizing the possibility of 'random' failures. In real-life events, the model proved useful in anticipating future system loads and interruptions that would injure the system. Some of the addressed challenges include the real-time processing of data streams and the scalability of data processing. The paper results show that ML models can underpin the increasingly dependable system, optimize operations in a cloud-computing environment and DevOps, and propose an innovative strategy for system preservation and failure anticipation."

      "abstract": "The Aviation 4.0 concept is an industry-wide approach that leverages the latest technologies to increase aircraft safety and operational efficiency. Predictive maintenance is a key aspect of Aviation 4.0, which uses cloud computing, big data, and machine learning to anticipate problems before they occur, thereby increasing safety and decreasing downtime for aircraft. The application of predictive maintenance can enhance efficiency and reduce costs by enabling maintenance to be scheduled before the failure occurs. The development of \u201crules of flight\u201d is being considered for Aviation 4.0 cyber-physical aircraft systems, which may automatically follow warnings if the crew fails to take appropriate action. This paper explores the implementation of Cloud-based Predictive Maintenance as a Service (CPMaaS) within the context of Aviation 4.0, utilizing C-MAPSS dataset. Leveraging advanced technologies such as LSTM models and SHAP analysis, the framework aims to enhance aircraft safety and operational efficiency by enabling proactive maintenance actions based on predictive insights derived from real-time sensor data. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing downtime and extending the lifespan of aircraft systems, paving the way for safer and more reliable aviation operations in the era of Industry 4.0."

      "abstract": "Edge Computing is becoming more and more essential for the Industrial Internet of Things (industrial IoT) for predictive maintenance in the industry 4.0 framework. The transition from central to distributed approaches (edge nodes), will enhance the capabilities of handling real-time big data from IoT by ensuring low latency and high bandwidth. Moreover, with the developed architecture the possibility is given to have distributed Machine Learning (ML) by enabling edge devices to learn local ML models. Therefore, the performances of the global diagnostic models can be improved. In this paper, the developed setup is composed of PC\u2019s, NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developers kits (for edge computing), and a smartphone for real-time displaying. The implemented real-time supervised machine learning approaches are applied on an industrial oil-injection screw compressor instrumented with vibration sensors. Time domain features are calculated online with the help of sliding windows and the features are automatically classified. Embedded in the equipment, the used algorithms obtained very good real-time diagnostic performances."

      "abstract": "The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) promises automation, efficiency, and data-driven decision-making by real-time data collection and analysis. However, traditional IIoT architectures are cloud-centric and, therefore, struggle to handle large volumes of data, edge bandwidth constraints, and data confidentiality. Distributed edge-to-cloud computing emerges as a potential solution, also paving the ground for edge-to-cloud data analytics and distributed Artificial Intelligence (AI) to obtain insights for decision-making and predictive maintenance. Despite the potential, however, there is a lack of comprehensive studies identifying key requirements for distributed edge-to-cloud IIoT and analyzing to what extent emerging IoT platforms meet those requirements. The scope of this article is to survey existing literature to identify key requirements in IIoT from the perspective of distributed edge-to-cloud computing. We provide a comparative analysis of three prominent IoT platforms, namely ThingsBoard, Eclipse Ditto, and Microsoft Azure IoT, and assess how these platforms meet the key IIoT requirements. Finally, we identify open challenges and potential research opportunities based on the insights gained from the analysis of the three IoT platforms, thereby setting the stage for future work."

      "abstract": "The recent migration towards Internet of Things determined the rise of a Computing Continuum paradigm where Edge and Cloud resources coordinate to support the execution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, becoming the foundation of use-cases spanning from predictive maintenance to machine vision and healthcare. This generates a fragmented scenario where computing and storage power are distributed among multiple devices with highly heterogeneous capacities. The runtime management of AI applications executed in the Computing Continuum is challenging, and requires ad-hoc solutions. We propose SPACE4AI-R, which combines Random Search and Stochastic Local Search algorithms to cope with workload fluctuations by identifying the minimum-cost reconfiguration of the initial production deployment, while providing performance guarantees across heterogeneous resources including Edge devices and servers, Cloud GPU-based Virtual Machines and Function as a Service solutions. Experimental results prove the efficacy of our tool, yielding up to 60% cost reductions against a static design-time placement, with a maximum execution time under 1.5s in the most complex scenarios."

      "abstract": "The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a key pillar of the Fourth Industrial Evolution or Industry 4.0. It aims to achieve direct information exchange between industrial machines, people, and processes. By tapping and analysing such data, IIoT can more importantly provide for significant improvements in productivity, product quality, and safety via proactive detection of problems in the performance and reliability of production machines, workers, and industrial processes. While the majority of existing IIoT research is currently focusing on the predictive maintenance of industrial machines (unplanned production stoppages lead to significant increases in costs and lost plant productivity), this paper focuses on monitoring and assessing worker productivity. This IIoT research is particularly important for large manufacturing plants where most production activities are performed by workers using tools and operating machines. With this aim, this paper introduces a novel industrial IoT solution for monitoring, evaluating, and improving worker and related plant productivity based on workers activity recognition using a distributed platform and wearable sensors. More specifically, this IIoT solution captures acceleration and gyroscopic data from wearable sensors in edge computers and analyses them in powerful processing servers in the cloud to provide a timely evaluation of the performance and productivity of each individual worker in the production line. These are achieved by classifying worker production activities and computing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) from the captured sensor data. We present a real-world case study that utilises our IIoT solution in a large meat processing plant (MPP). We illustrate the design of the IIoT solution, describe the in-plant data collection during normal operation, and present the sensor data analysis and related KPI computation, as well as the outcomes and lessons learnt."

      "abstract": "The increasing complexity and scale of industrial assets, such as machinery, equipment, and infrastructure, have led to a growing need for effective predictive maintenance strategies. Traditional time-based or reactive maintenance approaches often fall short in addressing the dynamic nature of asset degradation and failure patterns. This study explores the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms with edge computing to develop an intelligent predictive maintenance framework for industrial assets. By processing sensor data and executing ML models closer to the source, at the edge, this approach enables real-time anomaly detection, remaining useful life (RUL) estimation, and proactive maintenance scheduling. The paper outlines the key methods involved, including sensor data preprocessing, feature engineering, ML model development, and deployment on edge devices. It also discusses the benefits of this integration, such as reduced downtime, improved asset reliability, and enhanced operational efficiency. Furthermore, the study highlights emerging trends, such as transfer learning, ensemble modeling, and adaptive learning, which enhance the flexibility, accuracy, and adaptability of the AI-driven predictive maintenance system. The findings demonstrate the transformative potential of this synergy, empowering industrial operations to transition from reactive to predictive maintenance, ultimately optimizing asset performance and reducing maintenance costs."

      "abstract": "The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) enables intelligent predictive maintenance in smart manufacturing by incorporating IoT technologies, Big Data techniques, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and other ever-developing enabling technologies. Although a large body of research has been conducted on IIoT based predictive maintenance, most work focuses on addressing only a part of the problem. However, predictive maintenance involves an ecosystem from ingesting data from sensors to displaying the results on a dashboard for engineers to visualize. With increasing requirements for real-time responses and privacy, integrating edge computing is no doubt a promising trend. This article proposes a complete and optimized IoT Big Data ecosystem embedded into a three-layer architecture for predictive maintenance applications. The proposed architecture consists of an edge layer, a cloud layer, and an application layer. The proposed edge infrastructure distributes the tasks effectively between the cloud layer and edge layer. On top of the architecture, different layers are integrated seamlessly to address reliability and scalability issues. In addition, an edge computing-assisted autoencoder is introduced and enabled by being deployed in a distributed manner to improve both performance and efficiency. For practical interest, we also provide an application programming interface-oriented implementation guideline for readers. To verify the proposed ecosystem, a real case study from industry is conducted to demonstrate the performance gain of edge computing-based Internet of Things systems in conjunction with the autoencoder-based deep learning technique."

      "abstract": "Industrial Revolution 4.0 describes the rapid transformation that industry is going through due to Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and IoT (Internet of Things). Industrial IoT (IIOT) combines traditional industrial processes with modern technology such as sensors, data analytics, and machine learning to optimize and automate processes. Like the Industrial Revolution, IIoT is transforming the way that goods are produced, but with some significant differences. IoT enables machines and devices to communicate with one another in real-time, providing valuable insights into the performance of industrial processes. This allows for predictive maintenance, where machines can be repaired or replaced before they fail, reducing downtime and maintenance costs. OEE (Overall Equipment Efficiency), an industry standard for gauging production efficiency, is raised with the use of predictive maintenance. By employing IoT, cloud computing, machine learning and real-time monitoring to identify abnormalities, malfunctions, and errors in manufacturing equipment, this paper seeks to boost OEEas a result of predictive maintenance. Sensors are employed in equipment to identify motion and other crucial data, which is subsequently transmitted to the cloud for analysis. As a result of this work, equipment dependability and efficiency are increased while downtime and maintenance costs are decreased."

The system utilizes Nicla Sense ME sensors, a Raspberry Pi-based concentrator for real-time monitoring, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) machine-learning model for predictive analysis. Notably, the LSTM algorithm is an example of how the system\u2019s sandbox environment can be used, allowing external users to easily integrate custom models without altering the core platform. In the laboratory, the system achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.0156, with high accuracy across all sensors, detecting intentional anomalies with a 99.81% accuracy rate. In the real-world phase, the system maintained robust performance, with sensors recording a maximum Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.1821, an R-squared value of 0.8898, and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.72%, demonstrating precision even in the presence of environmental interferences. Additionally, the architecture supports scalability, accommodating up to 64 sensor nodes without compromising performance. The sandbox environment enhances the platform\u2019s versatility, enabling customization for diverse industrial applications. The results highlight the significant benefits of predictive maintenance in industrial contexts, including reduced downtime, optimized resource use, and improved operational efficiency. These findings underscore the potential of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven predictive maintenance into constrained environments, offering a reliable solution for dynamic, real-time industrial operations."

Therefore, in this work, we propose an IEC-enabled industrial task offloading and predictive maintenance framework for estimating downtime and future failures of industrial machines. At first, we classify industry-generated tasks into IEC executables and cloud executables using a heuristic technique. Then, tasks are offloaded to suitable computing devices using a queue allocation strategy. The remaining life of industrial machines is also accurately estimated with the help of several ML-based techniques. We carry out performance study with a practical dataset NASA Turbofan Jet Engine Dataset collected from 3 different types of industrial machines. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed strategy is effective in reducing the end-to-end delay and energy consumption rates while estimating scheduled maintenance at the network edge, generating near-optimal solutions."

      "abstract": "The use of sophisticated algorithms has radically altered cloud computing predictive auto-scaling and upkeep approaches. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), the Prophet Algorithm, K-Means Clustering, and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average (SARIMA) all play a role in improving cloud infrastructures, and their interactions are studied here. By capitalizing on their superiority in processing sequential data, RNNs can deduce accurate workload forecasts from past use patterns. Concurrently, the Prophet Algorithm records seasonal and annual patterns, which adds depth to forecasts. By grouping servers into clusters with similar consumption patterns, K-Means Clustering improves resource allocation efficiency and paves the way for precise auto-scaling. SARIMA models capture nuanced seasonal fluctuations, which lead to reliable demand forecasts. This explores the state-of-the-art and future directions of these techniques, illuminating their potential to revolutionize current approaches to cloud management. When these methods are combined, cloud service providers are better able to proactively scale their resources, hence reducing the likelihood of bottlenecks and outages. It foresees the development of these algorithms and their subsequent widespread use in a variety of fields outside of cloud computing, such as Internet of Things (IoT) networks and edge computing infrastructures."

      "abstract": "This study uses a wind turbine case study as a subdomain of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to showcase an architecture for implementing a distributed digital twin in which all important aspects of a predictive maintenance solution in a DT use a fog computing paradigm, and the typical predictive maintenance DT is improved to offer better asset utilization and management through real-time condition monitoring, predictive analytics, and health management of selected components of wind turbines in a wind farm. Digital twin (DT) is a technology that sits at the intersection of Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, and Software Engineering to provide a suitable tool for replicating physical objects in the digital space. This can facilitate the implementation of asset management in manufacturing systems through predictive maintenance solutions leveraged by machine learning (ML). With DTs, a solution architecture can easily use data and software to implement asset management solutions such as condition monitoring and predictive maintenance using acquired sensor data from physical objects and computing capabilities in the digital space. While DT offers a good solution, it is an emerging technology that could be improved with better standards, architectural framework, and implementation methodologies. Researchers in both academia and industry have showcased DT implementations with different levels of success. However, DTs remain limited in standards and architectures that offer efficient predictive maintenance solutions with real-time sensor data and intelligent DT capabilities. An appropriate feedback mechanism is also needed to improve asset management operations."
