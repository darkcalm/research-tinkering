The IIoT has changed the way businesses function by making available real-time data and insights from linked devices. Predictive maintenance is becoming increasingly important since it enables businesses to keep tabs on their machinery and fix any problems before they become costly breakdowns. This abstract explores the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in the creation of smart systems for predictive maintenance in the industrial IoT. The goal of predictive maintenance is to foresee impending equipment failure and take corrective measures in good time to avoid costly downtime. Downtime and extra expenses in maintenance are two potential outcomes of the traditional maintenance approach, which is often reactive or scheduled based on previous data. Using real-time data and machine learning techniques, intelligent systems driven by RNNs provide a possible answer. As a subset of artificial neural networks, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) excel at processing time-series data, making them an obvious candidate for predictive maintenance in the industrial IoT. RNNs include a feedback loop that allows them to capture temporal relationships in data, making them superior to typical feedforward neural networks for forecasting equipment failures based on past sensor data. Data gathering and preprocessing are major hurdles for RNN-based predictive maintenance in the industrial IoT. Massive volumes of sensor data are produced in industrial settings, and this data must be cleaned, processed, and prepared for training RNN models. In addition, predictive maintenance solutions can only be effective with high-quality, consistent data. When constructed properly, RNN models are capable of learning sensor data patterns and anomalies. These models can then inform maintenance crews of the impending failure of critical pieces of equipment. By utilising RNNs, not only can current sensor data be included but also past data, allowing for dynamic and adaptable upkeep tactics. Furthermore, for successful deployment, it is necessary to combine edge computing with cloud-based solutions. In order to analyse sensor data in real time and make prompt decisions, edge computing moves processing closer to the data source. Cloud-based solutions, on the other hand, can scale as needed, store data, and provide insights over time. When used together, these methods make for very responsive and scalable predictive maintenance systems. Intelligent predictive maintenance solutions may enhance equipment dependability, shorten repair times, and better distribute scarce resources. Predicting when maintenance is needed helps businesses save time and money by avoiding unneeded maintenance. There are advantages to using such systems beyond just financial savings. Predictive maintenance helps with sustainability since it lowers energy use, lessens waste, and lengthens the life of machinery. Workplace safety is improved as a result of a decrease in the possibility of unanticipated equipment failure.
