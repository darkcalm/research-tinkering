Predictive maintenance (PdM) is one of the major methods used in modern manufacturing to realize downtime minimization, lower the cost of maintenance and maximize machine service life by analyzing the collected data using data mining methodologies. However existing works mainly focus on conventional ML models without provide systems design real world applications systems and do not include any dimension related to network security dimension, cost and benefit analyzing dimension utility dimension and light weight A.I model for edge computing. In this paper, we contribute with a systematic literature review of state-of-the-art data-mining techniques for predictive maintenance with emphasis on hybrid AI frameworks, deep learning and online data processing approaches, as well as, privacy-aware methods. We contribute by providing a number of real-world industrial use case which differentiate us from previous researched; we discuss details of cybersecurity issues in IoT-enabled PdM; and we discuss use of XAI (Explainable AI) to build interpretable models. Moreover, this survey introduces marginal AI applications in edge computing, predictive maintenance frameworks with scalability, and AI-powered anomaly identification for enhancing predictions in industrial-scale production. It also covers a review of predictive maintenance methodologies in addition to a future research agenda, highlighting emerging patterns such as digital twins, Industry 5.0, and reinforcement learning in predictive maintenance. The current study aims to bridge critical gaps in the literature and support valuable direction for researchers, industry practitioners and policymakers for effective predictive maintenance strategies and task performance.
