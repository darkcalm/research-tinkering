Given the advance of the Smart Grid technology, the electrical grid is now in a process of transformation never seen in history. This new grid model allows customers and providers to generate and manage electrical power efficiently. To support such transformation, a key element of the model is the communication network responsible for delivering measurement data from sensors on the grid to the applications that analyze and adapt distribution according to demands. This work proposes and evaluates a system architecture that copes with reliability and latency demands that are of much importance for a successful Smart Grid deployment, also considering the internal design of distributed applications in the context of Smart Grids. The architecture adopts a Mobile Edge Computing based infrastructure that is suitable for 4G and 5G mobile cellular networks. Experiments made on NS-3 shows that the proposed system architecture is capable of handling a realistic number of smart meters while providing low latency and network reliability, supporting many use cases of a Smart Grid deployment.
