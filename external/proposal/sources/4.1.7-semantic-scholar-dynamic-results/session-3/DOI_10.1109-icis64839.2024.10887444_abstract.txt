Smart Grid 2.0 represents a significant advancement in energy systems, propelled by innovations such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain technology, and 5G telecommunications. These technologies enable dynamic and intelligent energy management while introducing new challenges in data processing and cybersecurity. This paper examines the role of various computing models—Cloud, Fog, Edge, and Distributed computing—within the framework of Smart Grids 2.0, emphasizing their impact on system efficiency and security. We first define each computing paradigm and its specific applications in smart grids. Next, we assess the security risks and computational challenges associated with these models, offering a comparative analysis of their performance in addressing concerns such as latency, scalability, and susceptibility to cyber-attacks. Proposed solutions, including encryption techniques and real-time threat detection, are discussed to strengthen the resilience of smart grids. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research, particularly in advancing cybersecurity measures and optimizing data processing in an increasingly interconnected energy infrastructure.
