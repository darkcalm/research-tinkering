      "abstract": "A key challenge in the power and energy field is the development of decision-support systems that enable studying big problems as a whole. The interoperability between systems that address specific parts of the global problem is essential. Ontologies ease the interoperability between heterogeneous systems providing semantic meaning to the information exchanged between the various parties. The use of ontologies within Smart Grids has been proposed based on the Common Information Model, which defines a common vocabulary describing the basic components used in electricity transportation and distribution. However, these ontologies are focused on utilities needs. The development of ontologies that allow the representation of diverse knowledge sources is essential, aiming at supporting the interaction between entities of different natures, facilitating the interoperability between these systems. This paper proposes a set of ontologies to enable the interoperability between different types of simulators, namely regarding electricity markets, the smart grid, and residential energy management. A case study based on real data shows the advantages of the proposed approach in enabling comprehensive power system simulation studies."

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a new reality. The insight derived from data collected from new Internet-connected devices can be used to develop new services, enhance productivity and efficiency, improve real-time decision making, solve critical problems, and create new and innovative experiences. In recent years, IoT related with energy, which is called Energy-IoT, is emerging as a major solution for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, sharply falling costs and growth in use of renewable energy, energy storage, and smart grid technologies. IoT can help an organization reduce energy waste in many ways. Organizations understand the natural synergies between the IoT and energy-related issues. The Energy-IoT based on distributed sensor networks is being employed in many applications, such as smart grid, microgrid, energy management system, and industrial security. However, as more devices connect, this revolutionary Energy-IoT service and applications based on physical and virtual sensor networks are facing converging risks with increased fragmentation, interoperability, privacy, safety, and security challenges. This special issue consists of the topics related to the physical and virtual sensor networks with Energy-IoT infrastructures, services, and applications for original, high-impact research papers and provides insight and future research directions to readers. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018Synchronization Method for LTE-based Machine-Type Communication in Lowpower Cellular IoT\u2019\u2019 by R Pec et al. proposed a synchronization method for long-term evolution (LTE)-based machine-type communication. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018Resource Management Model based on Cloud Computing Environment\u2019\u2019 by A Kim et al. proposed a model of resource management in cloud computing environment. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018A Multihop Angular Routing Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks\u2019\u2019 by M Akbar et al. proposed a protocol of multihop angular routing for wireless sensor networks. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018A Gateway Deployment Heuristic for Enhancing the Availability of Sensor Grids\u2019\u2019 by M Hussain et al. proposed a gateway deployment heuristic that enhances the sensor grids availability. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018Design of a Mass-Customization-based CostEffective Internet of Things Sensor System in Smart Building Spaces\u2019\u2019 by S Park et al. proposed an IoT sensor system in smart building spaces for cost-effectiveness. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018Effective and Reliable Malware Group Classification for a Massive Malware Environment\u2019\u2019 by T Lee et al. proposed an effective and reliable classification of malware group. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018Smart Energy Efficient Device-to-Multi Device Cooperative Clustering for Multicasting Content\u2019\u2019 by M Ashraf et al. proposed a cooperative clustering of device-to-multi device for multicasting content. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018Multi-Agent Semantical Annotation Enhancement Model for IoT based Energy Aware Data\u2019\u2019 by KR Malik et al. proposed a model of multiagent semantical annotation enhancement for IoT. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018Environment Parameters Control based on Wireless Sensor Network in Livestock Buildings\u2019\u2019 by Y Zhang et al. proposed an environment parameter control based on wireless sensor network. We have received a lot of submissions coming from different countries all around the globe in response to call for papers. Each accepted article has been reviewed by at least three reviewers. In the end, several articles based on technical novelty, integrity of the analysis, and social impacts and practical relevance have been revised and selected for publishing in this special issue. We believe that the accepted papers would be a meaningful contribution to researchers, students, and practitioners studying this field of physical and virtual sensor networks for Energy-IoT."
