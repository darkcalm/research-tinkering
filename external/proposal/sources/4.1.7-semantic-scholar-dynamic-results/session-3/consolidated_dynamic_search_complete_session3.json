        "abstract": "A key challenge in the power and energy field is the development of decision-support systems that enable studying big problems as a whole. The interoperability between systems that address specific parts of the global problem is essential. Ontologies ease the interoperability between heterogeneous systems providing semantic meaning to the information exchanged between the various parties. The use of ontologies within Smart Grids has been proposed based on the Common Information Model, which defines a common vocabulary describing the basic components used in electricity transportation and distribution. However, these ontologies are focused on utilities needs. The development of ontologies that allow the representation of diverse knowledge sources is essential, aiming at supporting the interaction between entities of different natures, facilitating the interoperability between these systems. This paper proposes a set of ontologies to enable the interoperability between different types of simulators, namely regarding electricity markets, the smart grid, and residential energy management. A case study based on real data shows the advantages of the proposed approach in enabling comprehensive power system simulation studies."

Multi-agent systems have shown to be a suitable software development paradigm for cyber-physical systems and may well profit from harnessing ontologies in terms of reduced engineering effort and better interoperability. This contribution presents a development methodology for ontologies that enable communication and reasoning in Multi-Agent Systems for cyber-physical systems. The methodology is unique in addressing a set of requirements specific to this application domain."

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a new reality. The insight derived from data collected from new Internet-connected devices can be used to develop new services, enhance productivity and efficiency, improve real-time decision making, solve critical problems, and create new and innovative experiences. In recent years, IoT related with energy, which is called Energy-IoT, is emerging as a major solution for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, sharply falling costs and growth in use of renewable energy, energy storage, and smart grid technologies. IoT can help an organization reduce energy waste in many ways. Organizations understand the natural synergies between the IoT and energy-related issues. The Energy-IoT based on distributed sensor networks is being employed in many applications, such as smart grid, microgrid, energy management system, and industrial security. However, as more devices connect, this revolutionary Energy-IoT service and applications based on physical and virtual sensor networks are facing converging risks with increased fragmentation, interoperability, privacy, safety, and security challenges. This special issue consists of the topics related to the physical and virtual sensor networks with Energy-IoT infrastructures, services, and applications for original, high-impact research papers and provides insight and future research directions to readers. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018Synchronization Method for LTE-based Machine-Type Communication in Lowpower Cellular IoT\u2019\u2019 by R Pec et al. proposed a synchronization method for long-term evolution (LTE)-based machine-type communication. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018Resource Management Model based on Cloud Computing Environment\u2019\u2019 by A Kim et al. proposed a model of resource management in cloud computing environment. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018A Multihop Angular Routing Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks\u2019\u2019 by M Akbar et al. proposed a protocol of multihop angular routing for wireless sensor networks. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018A Gateway Deployment Heuristic for Enhancing the Availability of Sensor Grids\u2019\u2019 by M Hussain et al. proposed a gateway deployment heuristic that enhances the sensor grids availability. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018Design of a Mass-Customization-based CostEffective Internet of Things Sensor System in Smart Building Spaces\u2019\u2019 by S Park et al. proposed an IoT sensor system in smart building spaces for cost-effectiveness. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018Effective and Reliable Malware Group Classification for a Massive Malware Environment\u2019\u2019 by T Lee et al. proposed an effective and reliable classification of malware group. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018Smart Energy Efficient Device-to-Multi Device Cooperative Clustering for Multicasting Content\u2019\u2019 by M Ashraf et al. proposed a cooperative clustering of device-to-multi device for multicasting content. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018Multi-Agent Semantical Annotation Enhancement Model for IoT based Energy Aware Data\u2019\u2019 by KR Malik et al. proposed a model of multiagent semantical annotation enhancement for IoT. The paper entitled \u2018\u2018Environment Parameters Control based on Wireless Sensor Network in Livestock Buildings\u2019\u2019 by Y Zhang et al. proposed an environment parameter control based on wireless sensor network. We have received a lot of submissions coming from different countries all around the globe in response to call for papers. Each accepted article has been reviewed by at least three reviewers. In the end, several articles based on technical novelty, integrity of the analysis, and social impacts and practical relevance have been revised and selected for publishing in this special issue. We believe that the accepted papers would be a meaningful contribution to researchers, students, and practitioners studying this field of physical and virtual sensor networks for Energy-IoT."

These technologies enable dynamic and intelligent energy management while introducing new challenges in data processing and cybersecurity. This paper examines the role of various computing models\u2014Cloud, Fog, Edge, and Distributed computing\u2014within the framework of Smart Grids 2.0, emphasizing their impact on system efficiency and security. We first define each computing paradigm and its specific applications in smart grids. Next, we assess the security risks and computational challenges associated with these models, offering a comparative analysis of their performance in addressing concerns such as latency, scalability, and susceptibility to cyber-attacks. Proposed solutions, including encryption techniques and real-time threat detection, are discussed to strengthen the resilience of smart grids. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research, particularly in advancing cybersecurity measures and optimizing data processing in an increasingly interconnected energy infrastructure."

This new grid model allows customers and providers to generate and manage electrical power efficiently. To support such transformation, a key element of the model is the communication network responsible for delivering measurement data from sensors on the grid to the applications that analyze and adapt distribution according to demands. This work proposes and evaluates a system architecture that copes with reliability and latency demands that are of much importance for a successful Smart Grid deployment, also considering the internal design of distributed applications in the context of Smart Grids. The architecture adopts a Mobile Edge Computing based infrastructure that is suitable for 4G and 5G mobile cellular networks. Experiments made on NS-3 shows that the proposed system architecture is capable of handling a realistic number of smart meters while providing low latency and network reliability, supporting many use cases of a Smart Grid deployment."

In this paper, we consider one of the key operations for smart grid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reliability, which is situational awareness and discuss the role that the edge computing can play to enhance this operation by providing distributed state estimation (DSE) locally at the edge nodes. We specifically focus on the network of the phasor measurement units (PMUs) as an example of the industrial internet of things in smart grids and discuss the edge-computing platform architecture to enable data analytics for DSE using the PMU time-series. We discuss that it is important to consider the physics of the smart grid in designing the edge-computing layer. As an example, we present a data-driven method for detecting power line trips using the PMU data and the designed physics-aware edge-computing platform."

        "abstract": "The explosive development of electrical engineering in the early 19th century marked the birth of the 2nd industrial revolution, with the use of electrical energy in place of steam power, as well as changing the history of human development. The versatility of electricity allows people to apply it to a multitude of fields such as transportation, heat applications, lighting, telecommunications, and computers. Nowadays, with the breakout development of science and technology, electric energy sources are formed by many different technologies such as hydroelectricity, solar power, wind power, coal power, etc. These energy sources are connected to form grid systems to transmit electricity to cities, businesses and homes for life and work. Electrical energy today has become the backbone of all modern technologies. To ensure the safe, reliable and energy-efficient operation of the grid, a wide range of grid management applications have been proposed. However, a significant challenge for monitoring and controlling grids is service response time. In recent times, to solve this problem, smart grid management applications based on IoT and edge computing have been proposed. In this work, we perform a comprehensive survey of edge computing for IoT-enabled smart grid systems. In addition, recent smart grid frameworks based on IoT and edge computing are discussed, important requirements are presented, and the open issues and challenges are indicated. We believe that in the Internet of Things era, the smart grid will be the future of energy. We hope that these study results will contribute important guidelines for in-depth research in the field of smart grids and green energy in the future."

Edge computing decentralizes the IT infrastructure in multiple edge data centers (EDCs) across the access networks to reduce latency and network congestion. Edge computing can benefit significantly from different aspects of smart grids to achieve lower energy consumption and greater resilience to electricity price fluctuations. This paper presents a modeling, simulation, and optimization (M&S&O) framework for analyzing and dimensioning smart grid-aware edge computing federations. This tool integrates aspects of a consumer-centric smart grid model to the resource management policies of the EDCs. To illustrate the benefits of this tool, we show a realistic case study for optimizing the energy consumption and operational expenses of an edge computing federation that provides service to a driver assistance IoT application. Results show that this approach can reduce the daily energy consumption by 20.3% and the electricity budget by 30.3%."

To increase network performance and stability, many applications are moving from cloud computing to edge computing (EC). However, in order to satisfy customers, applications like intelligent transportation systems, smart grids, smart cities, and healthcare call for even more effective services. This survey addresses extensive research on two aspects: firstly, we present the advancements of two application domains namely maritime areas and aerial systems in terms of integration with EC architecture. Secondly, we cover the most recent technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain, combined into the EC paradigm by discussing several experiments conducted in various fields to demonstrate the value of utilizing them in the edge computing architecture. We analyze the results of eleven experiments in each technology from 2015 to 2023."

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the integration of edge computing in smart sensor networks. In Internet of Things (IoT) applications, traditional cloud computing models cause data processing delays due to long-distance data transmission. This transmission delay significantly impairs real-time data processing and feedback capabilities, particularly in time-sensitive applications. Edge computing can transfer data to local devices for processing so that data that is affected by network congestion does not have to be transmitted long distances to the cloud for processing. It can greatly reduce the delay caused by network congestion and reduce energy consumption. In addition, it also provides certain guarantees for data security. Building upon these characteristics, edge computing offers several key advantages. First, it enables efficient local data processing for real-time operation. In some industrial applications such as smart grids and intelligent transportation systems, edge computing can operate highly autonomously. This avoids the delay caused by network fluctuations when transmitting to the cloud. This paper explores the integration of lightweight machine learning models, particularly TinyML, in edge computing applications. These models will improve the data processing capabilities of edge devices. Finally, the article also proposes further ideas for this new architecture to make up for the shortcomings of the architecture in task allocation and data processing."

        "abstract": "As urbanization accelerates, smart cities are emerging as innovative ecosystems that integrate technology to address challenges related to sustainability, mobility, and infrastructure. Among these technologies, edge computing has gained prominence as a transformative solution to optimize data processing and resource management in urban environments. This paper explores the role of edge computing in enabling efficient, real-time decision-making by bringing computational power closer to data sources. Unlike traditional cloud-centric models, edge computing reduces latency, enhances data security, and improves bandwidth utilization by distributing data processing across decentralized nodes. The integration of edge computing in smart cities supports various applications, including intelligent transportation systems, energy-efficient smart grids, and real-time public safety monitoring. By processing data locally, edge devices can handle massive volumes of information generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices, ensuring seamless service delivery without overwhelming centralized systems. Furthermore, this decentralized approach enhances resilience by reducing dependency on remote servers, a crucial factor for mission-critical urban applications. A significant focus of this paper is on resource management, particularly the allocation of computational resources across edge nodes. Strategies such as dynamic resource scheduling, load balancing, and adaptive task offloading are analyzed for their effectiveness in maintaining operational efficiency. Moreover, the research highlights the importance of leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms within edge computing frameworks to predict traffic patterns, optimize energy consumption, and enhance waste management systems. Security and privacy concerns, often considered barriers to edge computing adoption, are addressed through advanced encryption techniques and secure communication protocols. This paper also evaluates challenges associated with edge computing deployment, such as hardware limitations, interoperability issues, and the need for robust regulatory frameworks. Case studies from leading smart city projects illustrate successful implementations and offer insights into overcoming these obstacles. In addition to technical aspects, this research underscores the socioeconomic benefits of edge computing in urban settings. Improved public services, reduced environmental impact, and cost-effective infrastructure management demonstrate the potential of edge computing to revolutionize city living. By enabling real-time analytics and localized decision-making, edge computing supports a more responsive and adaptive urban ecosystem. The findings presented in this paper emphasize the critical role of edge computing in bridging the gap between urban challenges and technological solutions. As cities continue to evolve, adopting edge computing technologies will not only enhance operational efficiency but also foster innovation, sustainability, and inclusivity. Future research directions include exploring hybrid models combining edge and cloud computing, advancing hardware capabilities, and developing standardized frameworks to accelerate adoption. This paper contributes to the growing body of knowledge on edge computing, offering a comprehensive analysis of its applications, challenges, and potential in shaping the future of smart cities. By optimizing data processing and resource management, edge computing emerges as a cornerstone technology for creating smarter, more resilient urban environments."

        "abstract": "Edge computing, as an extension of cloud computing, brings computation and data storage closer to the data source. This shift offers significant advantages in terms of latency reduction, bandwidth optimization, and real-time processing capabilities. By minimizing the distance that data needs to travel, edge computing enhances the performance of applications that require rapid data processing and immediate response times. This is particularly beneficial for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, autonomous vehicles, smart grids, and other applications that demand low-latency interactions. However, the decentralization inherent in edge computing introduces a unique set of cybersecurity challenges that are distinct from those faced in traditional centralized cloud environments. The distributed architecture of edge computing creates numerous points of vulnerability, each of which can be exploited by cyber attackers. Additionally, edge devices often operate with limited computational resources and power, which complicates the implementation of robust security measures. This paper explores the cybersecurity implications of edge computing in the context of data engineering. It begins with a comprehensive review of existing literature to establish the current understanding of edge computing security issues. The review identifies the primary vulnerabilities associated with edge computing, including those related to distributed architecture, data transmission, and resource constraints. Following the literature review, the paper delves into specific security threats that edge computing environments face. These include man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, malware and ransomware, and insider threats. Each threat is analyzed to understand its potential impact on edge computing systems and the data they process."

Similarly, edge computing allows data analysis near the source, reducing time and using less bandwidth. This work examines the applications of federated learning in edge computing but focuses on scenarios with resource limitations, as seen with IoT devices and mobile networks. Reviewing the currently used approaches, issues, and trends, the features related to the future development involving opportunities and risks are considered. The emerging studies show that federated learning in the context of edge computing improves processing capacity in the federated model by preserving privacy concerns and is applicable in smart cities, healthcare smart grids, and self-driving systems. Some research directions for future works are suggested to address the scale-up and use of resources."

        "abstract": "Smart grid and cloud computing architectures have been perfectly suiting each other naturally. As a result, over the years cloud computing architectures have dominated the implementations of smart grid applications to address computing needs. However, due to continuing additions of heterogeneous (sensing and actuating) devices, emergence of Internet of Things (IoT), and massive amount of data collected across the grids for analytics, have contributed to the complexity of smart grids, making cloud computing architectures no longer suitable to provide smart grid services effectively. Edge and Fog computing approaches have relieved the cloud computing architectures of problems related to network congestion, latency and locality by shift of control, intelligence and trust to the edge of the network. In this paper, a systematic literature review is used to explore the research trend of the actual implementations of edge and fog computing for smart grid applications. A total of 70 papers were reviewed from the popular digital repositories. The study has revealed that, there is significant increase in the number of smart grid applications that have exploited the use edge and fog computing approaches. The study also shows that, considerable number of the smart grid applications are related to energy optimizations and intelligent coordination of smart grid resources. There are also challenges and issues that hinder smooth adoption of edge and fog computing for smart grid applications, which include security, interoperability and programming models."

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed our interaction with the world by connecting devices,\nsensors, and systems to the Internet, enabling real-time monitoring, control, and automation in various applications\nsuch as smart cities, healthcare, transportation, homes, and grids. However, challenges related to latency, privacy,\nand bandwidth have arisen due to the massive influx of data generated by IoT devices and the limitations of\ntraditional cloud-based architectures. Moreover, network management, interoperability, security, and scalability\nissues have emerged due to the rapid growth and heterogeneous nature of IoT devices. To overcome such\nproblems, researchers proposed a new architecture called Software Defined Networking for Edge Computing in the\nInternet of Things (SDN-EC-IoT), which combines Edge Computing for the Internet of Things (EC-IoT) and\nSoftware Defined Internet of Things (SDIoT). Although researchers have studied EC-IoT and SDIoT as individual\narchitectures, they have not yet addressed the combination of both, creating a significant gap in our understanding\nof SDN-EC-IoT. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive review of how the SDN-EC-IoT\nparadigm can solve IoT challenges. To achieve this goal, this study conducted a literature review covering 74\narticles published between 2019 and 2023. Finally, this paper identifies future research directions for SDN-EC-IoT,\nincluding the development of interoperability platforms, scalable architectures, low latency and Quality of Service\n(QoS) guarantees, efficient handling of big data, enhanced security and privacy, optimized energy consumption,\nresource-aware task offloading, and incorporation of machine learning."

        "abstract": "Green-powered edge computing architectures allow bringing computation in areas that are not reached by the power grids. More often, in applications for Precision Agriculture and Smart Cities, we could have a set of nodes that are coupled with an accumulator which is, during the day, re-charged by the energy harvested by small solar panels. With the latest advances in technology, the edge node is generally assimilated to be a low-power Single Board Computer (SBC), and it is able to carry out even relatively demanding tasks. For example, it can run deep learning models to images or video sequences captured in loco by cameras. However, due to the differences in terms of power consumption and weather conditions, each node experiences a different lifespan, some nodes may even shut down prematurely, causing the interruption of the portion of the deployed service. In this paper, we propose three decentralized algorithms that solve the problem by making the nodes cooperatively balance the traffic in order to level and maximize their lifespan. By comparing the approaches in two different experiments by using a cluster of Raspberry Pi 4 we show that our solutions allow to increase the lifespan of the service of 10% on average wrt the case in which no algorithm is applied."

        "abstract": "Recent advances in distributed data processing and machine learning provide new opportunities to enable critical, time-sensitive functionalities of smart distribution grids in a secure and reliable fashion. Combining the recent advents of edge computing (EC) and edge intelligence (EI) with existing advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) has the potential to reduce overall communication cost, preserve user privacy, and provide improved situational awareness. In this paper, we provide an overview for how EC and EI can supplement applications relevant to AMI systems. Additionally, using such systems in tandem can enable distributed deep learning frameworks (e.g., federated learning) to empower distributed data processing and intelligent decision making for AMI. Finally, to demonstrate the efficacy of this considered architecture, we approach the non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) problem using federated learning to train a deep recurrent neural network architecture in a 2-tier and 3-tier manner. In this approach, smart homes locally train a neural network using their metering data and only share the learned model parameters with AMI components for aggregation. Our results show this can reduce communication cost associated with distributed learning, as well as provide an immediate layer of privacy, due to no raw data being communicated to AMI components. Further, we show that FL is able to closely match the model loss provided by standard centralized deep learning where raw data is communicated for centralized training."

The Agent Communication Language is a standard language for the agents to communicate. The objective is to combine Timed-Arc Petri-nets and FIPA Performatives in real-time multi-agent systems. FIPA standards provide a richer framework for the interaction of agents and makes it easier to develop a well-defined system. It also ensures the management by precisely specifying the agent\u2019s interaction. Though FIPA protocol has already been described with the help of Petri-nets but this specification lacks the timing aspect that is a dire need for real-time multi-agent systems. The main objective of this research is to provide a method of modeling existing FIPA performatives by combining Timed-Arc Petri-nets in real-time multi-agent systems. We have used properties, such as liveness, deadlock and reachability for the formal verification of the proposed modeling technique."

The transition from central to distributed approaches (edge nodes), will enhance the capabilities of handling real-time big data from IoT by ensuring low latency and high bandwidth. Moreover, with the developed architecture the possibility is given to have distributed Machine Learning (ML) by enabling edge devices to learn local ML models. Therefore, the performances of the global diagnostic models can be improved. In this paper, the developed setup is composed of PC\u2019s, NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developers kits (for edge computing), and a smartphone for real-time displaying. The implemented real-time supervised machine learning approaches are applied on an industrial oil-injection screw compressor instrumented with vibration sensors. Time domain features are calculated online with the help of sliding windows and the features are automatically classified. Embedded in the equipment, the used algorithms obtained very good real-time diagnostic performances."

However, it requires specialized expertise to account for the wide variety of applications, edge devices, and deployment scenarios. An attractive approach to mitigate this bottleneck is Neural Architecture Search (NAS), as it allows for optimizing networks for both efficiency and task performance. This work shows that including hyperparameter optimization for training-related parameters alongside NAS enables substantial improvements in efficiency and task performance on a predictive maintenance task. Furthermore, this work extends the combination of NAS and hyperparameter optimization with INT8 quantization to enhance efficiency further. Our combined approach, which we refer to as Quantization-Aware NAS (QA-NAS), allows for further improvements in efficiency on the predictive maintenance task. Consequently, our work shows that QA-NAS is a promising research direction for optimizing neural networks for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices in industrial applications."

        "abstract": "Traditionally, Industrial IoT devices collect sensor data to a cloud platform where ML/DL processing is to be done. Edge computing has the advantage of reducing latency, improved battery performance, safe transmission and reducing vulnerability. These benefits are particularly significant considering the limited resources on IoT devices, such as only a few kilobytes of RAM, and the critical importance of energy savings in industrial applications. Arduino Uno uses 2kB of RAM and 32 kB of read only flash memory. Optimal performance is required for ML inference on EDGE devices to get good accuracies and low latency. This research paper is based on memory optimization in resource constrained devices, focusing on a novel approach that combines the Bonsai tree architecture with a smoothed Mish activation function. While the Bonsai tree architecture has been explored in prior works, this research contributes to the refinement of the activation function, a crucial component in achieving superior test accuracy within limited memory constraints. Although many algorithms have been developed with good accuracy but can\u2019t be used in optimal power consumption with low latency and resource constraint like fewer RAM and ROM. A smooth Mish activation function in Bonsai tree algorithm is proposed to enhance accuracy with lowest ML model size, where Bonsai tree is a single,shallow,sparse tree where data is projected in low dimension space. Lowest ML model size consumes least power. We observed the smoothed Mish activation function in the Bonsai tree algorithm outperform with low latency and power consumption. \nThis paper aims to elucidate the methodology, experimental results, and implications of the modified activation function, shedding light on its potential to revolutionize memory-efficient edge computing in the Industrial IoT network."

        "abstract": "Predictive maintenance (PdM) is one of the major methods used in modern manufacturing to realize downtime minimization, lower the cost of maintenance and maximize machine service life by analyzing the collected data using data mining methodologies. However existing works mainly focus on conventional ML models without provide systems design real world applications systems and do not include any dimension related to network security dimension, cost and benefit analyzing dimension utility dimension and light weight A.I model for edge computing. In this paper, we contribute with a systematic literature review of state-of-the-art data-mining techniques for predictive maintenance with emphasis on hybrid AI frameworks, deep learning and online data processing approaches, as well as, privacy-aware methods. We contribute by providing a number of real-world industrial use case which differentiate us from previous researched; we discuss details of cybersecurity issues in IoT-enabled PdM; and we discuss use of XAI (Explainable AI) to build interpretable models. Moreover, this survey introduces marginal AI applications in edge computing, predictive maintenance frameworks with scalability, and AI-powered anomaly identification for enhancing predictions in industrial-scale production. It also covers a review of predictive maintenance methodologies in addition to a future research agenda, highlighting emerging patterns such as digital twins, Industry 5.0, and reinforcement learning in predictive maintenance. The current study aims to bridge critical gaps in the literature and support valuable direction for researchers, industry practitioners and policymakers for effective predictive maintenance strategies and task performance."

        "abstract": "The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) promises automation, efficiency, and data-driven decision-making by real-time data collection and analysis. However, traditional IIoT architectures are cloud-centric and, therefore, struggle to handle large volumes of data, edge bandwidth constraints, and data confidentiality. Distributed edge-to-cloud computing emerges as a potential solution, also paving the ground for edge-to-cloud data analytics and distributed Artificial Intelligence (AI) to obtain insights for decision-making and predictive maintenance. Despite the potential, however, there is a lack of comprehensive studies identifying key requirements for distributed edge-to-cloud IIoT and analyzing to what extent emerging IoT platforms meet those requirements. The scope of this article is to survey existing literature to identify key requirements in IIoT from the perspective of distributed edge-to-cloud computing. We provide a comparative analysis of three prominent IoT platforms, namely ThingsBoard, Eclipse Ditto, and Microsoft Azure IoT, and assess how these platforms meet the key IIoT requirements. Finally, we identify open challenges and potential research opportunities based on the insights gained from the analysis of the three IoT platforms, thereby setting the stage for future work."

        "abstract": "In today's rapidly evolving industrial landscape, efficient predictive maintenance solutions are essential for minimizing downtime and enhancing productivity. This research introduces an adaptive cloud-based model pipeline for predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of machine components, specifically ball screws. The pipeline integrates local preprocessing, edge computing, and cloud-based adaptive model training, ensuring data privacy and reducing data transmission volumes. The system classifies wear states using various machine learning mod-els and predicts RUL through regression analysis, incorporating uncertainty quantification for robust maintenance scheduling. The experimental setup includes accelerated degradation of ball screws, with data collected via a three-dimensional accelerometer. Feature extraction and data augmentation techniques are employed to enhance prediction accuracy. Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models demonstrate superior performance, with Random Forest selected for its robustness and uncertainty quantification capabilities. Empirical results indicate high prediction accuracy, with Random Forest achieving up to 91% accuracy in Phase 2. This cloud-ready predictive maintenance framework leverages scalable cloud infrastructure for efficient data processing and real-time updates, offering a practical solution for industrial applications. The proposed approach significantly advances the adoption of digital business models within the manufacturing industry, providing a reliable and efficient tool for predictive maintenance."

New business models require more data, collected by IIoT edge node sensors based on inexpensive and low performance Microcontroller Units (MCUs). A negative side effect of this rise of interconnections is the increased attack surface, enabled by a larger network with more network services. Attaching badly documented and cheap devices to industrial networks often without permission of the administrator even further increases the security risk. A decent method to monitor the network and detect \u201cunwanted\u201d devices is network scanning. Typically, this scanning procedure is executed by a computer or server in each sub-network. In this paper, we introduce network scanning and mapping as a building block to scan directly from the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) edge node devices. This module scans the network in a pseudo-random periodic manner to discover devices and detect changes in the network structure. Furthermore, we validate our approach in an industrial testbed to show the feasibility of this approach."

        "abstract": "Deep Learning and Machine Learning algorithms achieved good results in various tasks, from computer vision and speech recognition to condition monitoring and predictive maintenance. Besides the good results obtained, most Deep Learning algorithms do not provide a precise interpretation of their decisions. For the purpose of interpretability, explainable ML has gained attention. Because hardware accelerators do not support most explainable Machine Learning algorithms, they frequently experience runtime deficiencies. The resulting need for comparably inefficient software implementations limits their use on edge-computing hardware. This paper presents a method to represent trained explainable ML algorithms as Deep Neural Networks to utilize hardware acceleration to meet the growing demand for accelerated inference of Machine Learning algorithms on edge hardware. The primary approach of the paper is to disassemble the trained explainable ML algorithms' inference into their basic mathematical operations to represent them as Deep Neural Network layers. The techniques to convert the trained model functionalities to Deep Neural Network layers are described in detail, including the layer functionalities and their usage in the Deep Neural Networks. Due to the wide use of Deep Neural Networks on hardware accelerators, this method allows the usage of affordable and efficient edge hardware instead of high-price, customized hardware and replaces the programming of high-effort compiler. Finally, the method is successfully applied to a part of an open-source ML toolbox, and the resulting Deep Neural network inferences are successfully run on a Neural Processing Unit."

        "abstract": "Deep learning is at the cutting edge of machine learning in fields as critical and diverse as predictive maintenance in industry and anomaly detection in healthcare. Data augmentation can facilitate deep learning applications in these time series domain tasks, which are often data poor by virtue of involving relatively rare systemic malfunction. A literature gap exists around the application of the transformer to data augmentation in time series. This work presents a transformer based architecture hybridizing several successful priors, and a quality testing metric using power spectrum Wasserstein distances. Though promising in theory, results suggest the challenge of this task and domain combination, and highlight several valuable directions for future work."

        "abstract": "The recent migration towards Internet of Things determined the rise of a Computing Continuum paradigm where Edge and Cloud resources coordinate to support the execution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, becoming the foundation of use-cases spanning from predictive maintenance to machine vision and healthcare. This generates a fragmented scenario where computing and storage power are distributed among multiple devices with highly heterogeneous capacities. The runtime management of AI applications executed in the Computing Continuum is challenging, and requires ad-hoc solutions. We propose SPACE4AI-R, which combines Random Search and Stochastic Local Search algorithms to cope with workload fluctuations by identifying the minimum-cost reconfiguration of the initial production deployment, while providing performance guarantees across heterogeneous resources including Edge devices and servers, Cloud GPU-based Virtual Machines and Function as a Service solutions. Experimental results prove the efficacy of our tool, yielding up to 60% cost reductions against a static design-time placement, with a maximum execution time under 1.5s in the most complex scenarios."

        "abstract": "A central use case for the Internet of Things (IoT) is the adoption of sensors to monitor physical processes, such as the environment and industrial manufacturing processes, where they provide data for predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, or similar. The sensor devices are typically resource-constrained in terms of computation and power, and need to rely on cloud or edge computing for data processing. However, the capacity of the wireless link and their power constraints limit the amount of data that can be transmitted to the cloud. While this is not problematic for the monitoring of slowly varying processes such as temperature, it is more problematic for complex signals such as those captured by vibration and acoustic sensors. In this paper, we consider the specific problem of remote anomaly detection based on signals that fall into the latter category over wireless channels with resource-constrained sensors. We study the impact of source coding on the detection accuracy with both an anomaly detector based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and one based on an autoencoder. We show that the coded transmission is beneficial when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the channel is low, while uncoded transmission performs best in the high SNR regime."

A distribution subsystem comprises a CPS (Cyber Physical System) where the Cyber part is enabled by a low latency IIoT network and computational resources at the edge (distribution grid subsystem controller) while the physical system is represented (Digital Twin) by a hybrid model of the grid: a data driven machine learning representation of a limited number of nodes, along with a discrete-time model-based transient state estimator which captures the near real time physical operation of the grid. In case of early warning measurements acquired through the IIoT, machine learning edge computations can detect the severity of the warning, identify the network area of interest while ignite the execution of the transient state estimation. The transient state estimation predicts the incoming failure in near real time while the timing window allows possible preventive actuation."

This research addresses these limitations by proposing an edge-cloud hybrid framework, leveraging edge devices for immediate anomaly detection and cloud servers for in-depth failure prediction. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNNs) model is deployed on edge devices to detect anomalies in real-time, reducing the need for continuous data transfer to the cloud. Meanwhile, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model in the cloud analyzes time-series data for predictive failure analysis, enhancing maintenance scheduling and operational efficiency. The framework\u2019s dynamic workload management algorithm optimizes task distribution between edge and cloud resources, balancing latency, bandwidth usage, and energy consumption. Experimental results show that the hybrid approach achieves a 35% reduction in latency, a 28% decrease in energy consumption, and a 60% reduction in bandwidth usage compared to cloud-only solutions. This framework offers a scalable, efficient solution for real-time predictive maintenance, making it highly applicable to resource-constrained, data-intensive environments."

        "abstract": "The increasing complexity and scale of industrial assets, such as machinery, equipment, and infrastructure, have led to a growing need for effective predictive maintenance strategies. Traditional time-based or reactive maintenance approaches often fall short in addressing the dynamic nature of asset degradation and failure patterns. This study explores the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms with edge computing to develop an intelligent predictive maintenance framework for industrial assets. By processing sensor data and executing ML models closer to the source, at the edge, this approach enables real-time anomaly detection, remaining useful life (RUL) estimation, and proactive maintenance scheduling. The paper outlines the key methods involved, including sensor data preprocessing, feature engineering, ML model development, and deployment on edge devices. It also discusses the benefits of this integration, such as reduced downtime, improved asset reliability, and enhanced operational efficiency. Furthermore, the study highlights emerging trends, such as transfer learning, ensemble modeling, and adaptive learning, which enhance the flexibility, accuracy, and adaptability of the AI-driven predictive maintenance system. The findings demonstrate the transformative potential of this synergy, empowering industrial operations to transition from reactive to predictive maintenance, ultimately optimizing asset performance and reducing maintenance costs."

The objective is to foresee systemic risks and guard against their occurrence by reviewing operational data and establishing succeeding patterns of poor system performance. Experiments are performed with accurate logs of system and service activities from a cloud service provider. At the same time, the developed ML models were established to provide reasonably accurate estimates of failures, hence minimizing the possibility of 'random' failures. In real-life events, the model proved useful in anticipating future system loads and interruptions that would injure the system. Some of the addressed challenges include the real-time processing of data streams and the scalability of data processing. The paper results show that ML models can underpin the increasingly dependable system, optimize operations in a cloud-computing environment and DevOps, and propose an innovative strategy for system preservation and failure anticipation."

Predictive maintenance is a key aspect of Aviation 4.0, which uses cloud computing, big data, and machine learning to anticipate problems before they occur, thereby increasing safety and decreasing downtime for aircraft. The application of predictive maintenance can enhance efficiency and reduce costs by enabling maintenance to be scheduled before the failure occurs. The development of \u201crules of flight\u201d is being considered for Aviation 4.0 cyber-physical aircraft systems, which may automatically follow warnings if the crew fails to take appropriate action. This paper explores the implementation of Cloud-based Predictive Maintenance as a Service (CPMaaS) within the context of Aviation 4.0, utilizing C-MAPSS dataset. Leveraging advanced technologies such as LSTM models and SHAP analysis, the framework aims to enhance aircraft safety and operational efficiency by enabling proactive maintenance actions based on predictive insights derived from real-time sensor data. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing downtime and extending the lifespan of aircraft systems, paving the way for safer and more reliable aviation operations in the era of Industry 4.0."

        "abstract": "The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a key pillar of the Fourth Industrial Evolution or Industry 4.0. It aims to achieve direct information exchange between industrial machines, people, and processes. By tapping and analysing such data, IIoT can more importantly provide for significant improvements in productivity, product quality, and safety via proactive detection of problems in the performance and reliability of production machines, workers, and industrial processes. While the majority of existing IIoT research is currently focusing on the predictive maintenance of industrial machines (unplanned production stoppages lead to significant increases in costs and lost plant productivity), this paper focuses on monitoring and assessing worker productivity. This IIoT research is particularly important for large manufacturing plants where most production activities are performed by workers using tools and operating machines. With this aim, this paper introduces a novel industrial IoT solution for monitoring, evaluating, and improving worker and related plant productivity based on workers activity recognition using a distributed platform and wearable sensors. More specifically, this IIoT solution captures acceleration and gyroscopic data from wearable sensors in edge computers and analyses them in powerful processing servers in the cloud to provide a timely evaluation of the performance and productivity of each individual worker in the production line. These are achieved by classifying worker production activities and computing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) from the captured sensor data. We present a real-world case study that utilises our IIoT solution in a large meat processing plant (MPP). We illustrate the design of the IIoT solution, describe the in-plant data collection during normal operation, and present the sensor data analysis and related KPI computation, as well as the outcomes and lessons learnt."

        "abstract": "The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) enables intelligent predictive maintenance in smart manufacturing by incorporating IoT technologies, Big Data techniques, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and other ever-developing enabling technologies. Although a large body of research has been conducted on IIoT based predictive maintenance, most work focuses on addressing only a part of the problem. However, predictive maintenance involves an ecosystem from ingesting data from sensors to displaying the results on a dashboard for engineers to visualize. With increasing requirements for real-time responses and privacy, integrating edge computing is no doubt a promising trend. This article proposes a complete and optimized IoT Big Data ecosystem embedded into a three-layer architecture for predictive maintenance applications. The proposed architecture consists of an edge layer, a cloud layer, and an application layer. The proposed edge infrastructure distributes the tasks effectively between the cloud layer and edge layer. On top of the architecture, different layers are integrated seamlessly to address reliability and scalability issues. In addition, an edge computing-assisted autoencoder is introduced and enabled by being deployed in a distributed manner to improve both performance and efficiency. For practical interest, we also provide an application programming interface-oriented implementation guideline for readers. To verify the proposed ecosystem, a real case study from industry is conducted to demonstrate the performance gain of edge computing-based Internet of Things systems in conjunction with the autoencoder-based deep learning technique."

        "abstract": "Industrial Revolution 4.0 describes the rapid transformation that industry is going through due to Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and IoT (Internet of Things). Industrial IoT (IIOT) combines traditional industrial processes with modern technology such as sensors, data analytics, and machine learning to optimize and automate processes. Like the Industrial Revolution, IIoT is transforming the way that goods are produced, but with some significant differences. IoT enables machines and devices to communicate with one another in real-time, providing valuable insights into the performance of industrial processes. This allows for predictive maintenance, where machines can be repaired or replaced before they fail, reducing downtime and maintenance costs. OEE (Overall Equipment Efficiency), an industry standard for gauging production efficiency, is raised with the use of predictive maintenance. By employing IoT, cloud computing, machine learning and real-time monitoring to identify abnormalities, malfunctions, and errors in manufacturing equipment, this paper seeks to boost OEEas a result of predictive maintenance. Sensors are employed in equipment to identify motion and other crucial data, which is subsequently transmitted to the cloud for analysis. As a result of this work, equipment dependability and efficiency are increased while downtime and maintenance costs are decreased."

The system utilizes Nicla Sense ME sensors, a Raspberry Pi-based concentrator for real-time monitoring, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) machine-learning model for predictive analysis. Notably, the LSTM algorithm is an example of how the system\u2019s sandbox environment can be used, allowing external users to easily integrate custom models without altering the core platform. In the laboratory, the system achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.0156, with high accuracy across all sensors, detecting intentional anomalies with a 99.81% accuracy rate. In the real-world phase, the system maintained robust performance, with sensors recording a maximum Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.1821, an R-squared value of 0.8898, and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.72%, demonstrating precision even in the presence of environmental interferences. Additionally, the architecture supports scalability, accommodating up to 64 sensor nodes without compromising performance. The sandbox environment enhances the platform\u2019s versatility, enabling customization for diverse industrial applications. The results highlight the significant benefits of predictive maintenance in industrial contexts, including reduced downtime, optimized resource use, and improved operational efficiency. These findings underscore the potential of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven predictive maintenance into constrained environments, offering a reliable solution for dynamic, real-time industrial operations."

        "abstract": "Recent advances in edge computing have enabled latency-critical industrial applications to increase their capa-bilities by transferring computation data to the network edge, where data processing and analysis occur. However, the major challenge of a smart industry is to minimize downtime and maximize machine lifetime by intelligently estimating predictive maintenance. These demands can be solved by combining the benefits of Industrial Edge Computing (IEC) and Machine Learning (ML) paradigms. Therefore, in this work, we propose an IEC-enabled industrial task offloading and predictive maintenance framework for estimating downtime and future failures of industrial machines. At first, we classify industry-generated tasks into IEC executables and cloud executables using a heuristic technique. Then, tasks are offloaded to suitable computing devices using a queue allocation strategy. The remaining life of industrial machines is also accurately estimated with the help of several ML-based techniques. We carry out performance study with a practical dataset NASA Turbofan Jet Engine Dataset collected from 3 different types of industrial machines. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed strategy is effective in reducing the end-to-end delay and energy consumption rates while estimating scheduled maintenance at the network edge, generating near-optimal solutions."

        "abstract": "The use of sophisticated algorithms has radically altered cloud computing predictive auto-scaling and upkeep approaches. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), the Prophet Algorithm, K-Means Clustering, and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average (SARIMA) all play a role in improving cloud infrastructures, and their interactions are studied here. By capitalizing on their superiority in processing sequential data, RNNs can deduce accurate workload forecasts from past use patterns. Concurrently, the Prophet Algorithm records seasonal and annual patterns, which adds depth to forecasts. By grouping servers into clusters with similar consumption patterns, K-Means Clustering improves resource allocation efficiency and paves the way for precise auto-scaling. SARIMA models capture nuanced seasonal fluctuations, which lead to reliable demand forecasts. This explores the state-of-the-art and future directions of these techniques, illuminating their potential to revolutionize current approaches to cloud management. When these methods are combined, cloud service providers are better able to proactively scale their resources, hence reducing the likelihood of bottlenecks and outages. It foresees the development of these algorithms and their subsequent widespread use in a variety of fields outside of cloud computing, such as Internet of Things (IoT) networks and edge computing infrastructures."

        "abstract": "This study uses a wind turbine case study as a subdomain of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to showcase an architecture for implementing a distributed digital twin in which all important aspects of a predictive maintenance solution in a DT use a fog computing paradigm, and the typical predictive maintenance DT is improved to offer better asset utilization and management through real-time condition monitoring, predictive analytics, and health management of selected components of wind turbines in a wind farm. Digital twin (DT) is a technology that sits at the intersection of Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, and Software Engineering to provide a suitable tool for replicating physical objects in the digital space. This can facilitate the implementation of asset management in manufacturing systems through predictive maintenance solutions leveraged by machine learning (ML). With DTs, a solution architecture can easily use data and software to implement asset management solutions such as condition monitoring and predictive maintenance using acquired sensor data from physical objects and computing capabilities in the digital space. While DT offers a good solution, it is an emerging technology that could be improved with better standards, architectural framework, and implementation methodologies. Researchers in both academia and industry have showcased DT implementations with different levels of success. However, DTs remain limited in standards and architectures that offer efficient predictive maintenance solutions with real-time sensor data and intelligent DT capabilities. An appropriate feedback mechanism is also needed to improve asset management operations."

Traditional corrective maintenance methods are often insufficient, necessitating advanced predictive approaches driven by AI technologies. However, existing literature lacks a comprehensive evaluation of these AI-driven strategies, with sustainability considerations often overlooked. To address this, we have executed a critical literature survey in which we evaluate all models with the metrics of cost, performance, ease of implementation, etc. Our study examines various predictive maintenance models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), Stochastic Models,Particle Swarm Optimisation and Constrained Programming [1]\u2013[5]. Our findings conclude with the proposition of our proposed model, which integrates ANN and CNN, along with Life Cycle Assessment to incorporate sustainability. By evaluating performance, cost-effectiveness, and practicality, we aim to develop comprehensive AI-driven main-tenance strategies. We focus on the accuracy, complexity, and scalability of each model and assess their ability to address road bridge infrastructure maintenance challenges. Additionally, we evaluate the sustainability implications, providing insights for future research and practice. This study aims to bridge the gap in the literature and contribute to the development of sustainable predictive maintenance strategies leveraging AI technologies, and propose the predictive road maintenance model workflow, which will further lead to build a prototype of AI driven technologies based predictive model."

        "abstract": "Appropriate maintenance of industrial equipment keeps production systems in good health and ensures the stability of production processes. In specific production sectors, such as the electrical power industry, equipment failures are rare but may lead to high costs and substantial economic losses not only for the power plant but for consumers and the larger society. Therefore, the power production industry relies on a variety of approaches to maintenance tasks, ranging from traditional solutions and engineering know-how to smart, AI-based analytics to avoid potential downtimes. This review shows the evolution of maintenance approaches to support maintenance planning, equipment monitoring and supervision. We present older techniques traditionally used in maintenance tasks and those that rely on IT analytics to automate tasks and perform the inference process for failure detection. We analyze prognostics and health-management techniques in detail, including their requirements, advantages and limitations. The review focuses on the power-generation sector. However, some of the issues addressed are common to other industries. The article also presents concepts and solutions that utilize emerging technologies related to Industry 4.0, touching on prescriptive analysis, Big Data and the Internet of Things. The primary motivation and purpose of the article are to present the existing practices and classic methods used by engineers, as well as modern approaches drawing from Artificial Intelligence and the concept of Industry 4.0. The summary of existing practices and the state of the art in the area of predictive maintenance provides two benefits. On the one hand, it leads to improving processes by matching existing tools and methods. On the other hand, it shows researchers potential directions for further analysis and new developments."

        "abstract": "The IIoT has changed the way businesses function by making available real-time data and insights from linked devices. Predictive maintenance is becoming increasingly important since it enables businesses to keep tabs on their machinery and fix any problems before they become costly breakdowns. This abstract explores the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in the creation of smart systems for predictive maintenance in the industrial IoT. The goal of predictive maintenance is to foresee impending equipment failure and take corrective measures in good time to avoid costly downtime. Downtime and extra expenses in maintenance are two potential outcomes of the traditional maintenance approach, which is often reactive or scheduled based on previous data. Using real-time data and machine learning techniques, intelligent systems driven by RNNs provide a possible answer. As a subset of artificial neural networks, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) excel at processing time-series data, making them an obvious candidate for predictive maintenance in the industrial IoT. RNNs include a feedback loop that allows them to capture temporal relationships in data, making them superior to typical feedforward neural networks for forecasting equipment failures based on past sensor data. Data gathering and preprocessing are major hurdles for RNN-based predictive maintenance in the industrial IoT. Massive volumes of sensor data are produced in industrial settings, and this data must be cleaned, processed, and prepared for training RNN models. In addition, predictive maintenance solutions can only be effective with high-quality, consistent data. When constructed properly, RNN models are capable of learning sensor data patterns and anomalies. These models can then inform maintenance crews of the impending failure of critical pieces of equipment. By utilising RNNs, not only can current sensor data be included but also past data, allowing for dynamic and adaptable upkeep tactics. Furthermore, for successful deployment, it is necessary to combine edge computing with cloud-based solutions. In order to analyse sensor data in real time and make prompt decisions, edge computing moves processing closer to the data source. Cloud-based solutions, on the other hand, can scale as needed, store data, and provide insights over time. When used together, these methods make for very responsive and scalable predictive maintenance systems. Intelligent predictive maintenance solutions may enhance equipment dependability, shorten repair times, and better distribute scarce resources. Predicting when maintenance is needed helps businesses save time and money by avoiding unneeded maintenance. There are advantages to using such systems beyond just financial savings. Predictive maintenance helps with sustainability since it lowers energy use, lessens waste, and lengthens the life of machinery. Workplace safety is improved as a result of a decrease in the possibility of unanticipated equipment failure."

An IoT and machine learning (ML)-driven framework for predictive maintenance in hospital infrastructures is presented in this work. Real-time data on operational parameters is gathered and examined by means of IoT sensors installed on medical equipment and building tools. To foresee equipment breakdown before occurrence, a Random Forest-based predictive maintenance model was put in use. Our case study done in a tertiary care hospital showed a 20% increase in maintenance cost efficiency and a 27% decrease in unanticipated equipment downtime. The results highlight how well smart predictive systems might improve operational resilience, lower costs, and guarantee patient safety."

An increasing bidirectional energy flow stresses the assets of the distribution grid, especially medium voltage switchgear. This calls for improved maintenance strategies to prevent critical failures. Predictive maintenance, a maintenance strategy relying on current condition data of assets, serves as a guideline. Novel sensors covering thermal, mechanical, and partial discharge aspects of switchgear, enable continuous condition monitoring of some of the most critical assets of the distribution grid. Combined with machine learning algorithms, the demands put on the distribution grid by the energy and mobility revolutions can be handled. In this paper, we review the current state-of-the-art of all aspects of condition monitoring for medium voltage switchgear. Furthermore, we present an approach to develop a predictive maintenance system based on novel sensors and machine learning. We show how the existing medium voltage grid infrastructure can adapt these new needs on an economic scale."

Solving these challenges is of uttermost importance to mission-critical industrial operations. Furthermore, effective application of predictive maintenance requires well-trained machine learning algorithms which on their turn require high volumes of reliable data. This paper addresses both challenges and presents the Smart Maintenance Living Lab, an open test and research platform that consists of a fleet of drivetrain systems for accelerated lifetime tests of rolling-element bearings, a scalable IoT middleware cloud platform for reliable data ingestion and persistence, and a dynamic dashboard application for fleet monitoring and visualization. Each individual component within the presented system is discussed and validated, demonstrating the feasibility of IIoT applications for smart machine maintenance. The resulting platform provides benchmark data for the improvement of machine learning algorithms, gives insights into the design, implementation and validation of a complete architecture for IIoT applications with specific requirements concerning robustness, scalability and security and therefore reduces the reticence in the industry to widely adopt these technologies."

        "abstract": "Telecommunication, with its recent advancement, has become an essential and crucial part of smart grids to enable reliable, efficient, and safe operations. Telecommunication predictive maintenance plays a key role in transforming the way in which the electricity grid is monitored. By predicting the availability status and failure possibility of telecommunication equipment, the operators in the smart grid control center can make proper decisions and efficient maintenance scheduling. In this work, a monitoring system for telecommunication equipment in the smart grid is proposed. The system includes three main components: availability prediction, failure prediction, and visualization. Time series analysis is performed using K-means clustering to classify the availability time series into clusters with similar behaviors. For each cluster, an ensemble boosting algorithm is applied to predict the availability value of each piece of equipment in the next hour, 12 hours, and 24 hours. Fully convolutional network (FCN) and Residual network (ResNet) are employed to predict the failures as a classification task. With availability prediction, the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model shows accurate prediction results with a mean absolute error between 1 - 9%. For failure prediction, deep learning outperforms the ensemble models with an F1 score of 91%. The prediction results are visualized in a Grafana dashboard to facilitate the smart grid monitoring services. Telecommunication automation coupled with appropriate visualization tools enables the advancement in the smart grid field."

However, since such systems can only be mounted on the housing of the considered components, important signals of critical parts deep inside a multi-stage layout may not be detectable this way. In this case, gear-integrated autonomous wireless sensors (GROWS) based on an embedded system design with maximized power efficiency may become the only reliable option. In this paper, the real world challenges during the realization of GROWS as well as the actual gathered measurements using it are discussed."

        "abstract": "Over the past few decades, intelligentization, supported by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, has become an important trend for industrial manufacturing, accelerating the development of smart manufacturing. In modern industries, standard AI has been endowed with additional attributes, yielding the so-called industrial artificial intelligence (IAI) that has become the technical core of smart manufacturing. AI-powered manufacturing brings remarkable improvements in many aspects of closed-loop production chains from manufacturing processes to end product logistics. In particular, IAI incorporating domain knowledge has benefited the area of production monitoring considerably. Advanced AI methods such as deep neural networks, adversarial training, and transfer learning have been widely used to support both diagnostics and predictive maintenance of the entire production process. It is generally believed that IAI is the critical technologies needed to drive the future evolution of industrial manufacturing. This article offers a comprehensive overview of AI-powered manufacturing and its applications in monitoring. More specifically, it summarizes the key technologies of IAI and discusses their typical application scenarios with respect to three major aspects of production monitoring: fault diagnosis, remaining useful life prediction, and quality inspection. In addition, the existing problems and future research directions of IAI are also discussed. This article further introduces the papers in this focused section on AI-based monitoring in smart manufacturing by weaving them into the overview, highlighting how they contribute to and extend the body of literature in this area."

        "abstract": "The Smart City Concept throughout all its current definitions is essentially a system that uses state-of-the-art ICT to provide and process information, to adapt and learn. The Internet of Things and advances in affordable sensor technology play an additional important role. The net result of the \u201csmartification\u201d of a city is the creation of a living, networked system of assets, devices and infrastructure. This living system continuously collects data that enables the system to learn and evolve. \nThis is nothing new or path-breaking. In logistics and the manufacturing industry, this concept has been widely implemented to optimise supply chains, from predictive maintenance, to dynamic route optimisation and online business intelligence (BI). \u201cIndustry 4.0\u201d has evolved from a buzzword to everyday reality. Moreover, these technologies do not just \u201celectrify\u201d existing processes \u2013 they enable new processes and beyond that even completely new business models that would not have been feasible with the pre-Industry-4.0 technology. Particularly the advent of in-memory business analytics that enables BI from the original transaction data in an on-demand/online fashion has facilitated this development. Now, the public sector is discovering these technologies for its own purposes. \nThis contribution attempts to show the parallelism, but also differences between smart cities and Industry 4.0, where learning effects may occur and known pitfalls may be avoided."

Here, we try, for example, to collect measurements data from the flammable gas, temperature sensors and DC motor. This proposed work takes advantage of being scalable and also proposing a solution to solve temperature, redundancy and electromagnetic compatibility problems, which are the critical parameters in the majority of applications based on IIoT (Industrial IoT) solutions. The proposed smart telemetry system is promising and could play an important role in reducing repairs costs and improve efficiencies in preventive and predictive maintenance. Consequently, manufacturing and logistics environments could increase their productivity by using IIoT technologies to anticipate maintenance needs to prevent equipment failures and avoid unscheduled downtime."
