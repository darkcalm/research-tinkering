 # Product Requirements Document: Human DER Worker Digital Twin Framework (v2)

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a software framework designed to create and operate Human DER Worker Digital Twins (HDTs). The project's goal is to leverage emerging agent protocol primitives—specifically MCP, ACP, and A2A—to model the operational behaviors of human workers in Distributed Energy Resource (DER) systems.

The framework will serve as a foundation for research into modeling human operational patterns. The requirements are presented as a range of **minimal** (proof-of-concept) and **aspirational** (research-grade) outcomes.

## 2. Goals

### Minimal
- To build a functional software prototype that demonstrates the basic integration of MCP, ACP, and A2A protocols in an agent-based system.
- To run a single, hardcoded proof-of-concept simulation to validate technical feasibility.

### Aspirational
- To develop a flexible and robust framework that enables digital twin modeling for a wide variety of energy operational simulations.
- To provide a platform for researchers to configure, calibrate, and evaluate high-fidelity digital twins of human operators.

## 3. User Stories

### Minimal
*   **As a developer,** I want to run a single, predefined simulation scenario to confirm that the MCP, ACP, and A2A protocol integrations are functioning correctly.
*   **As a developer,** I want to see logged outputs of the protocol interactions to debug the system.

### Aspirational
*   **As a researcher,** I want to configure the framework to model various DER operator roles so that I can study and compare their operational behaviors.
*   **As a researcher,** I want to define and dynamically load a set of consequential operational behaviors to analyze their systemic impact.
*   **As a simulation engineer,** I want to run the digital twin in a simulated environment and calibrate its underlying LLM so that its behavior becomes more representative of real-world operational outputs over time.
*   **As a simulation engineer,** I want to orchestrate interactions between multiple digital twins to model complex, multi-agent coordination scenarios.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Core Framework
- **Minimal:** The system shall provide a basic software framework for instantiating a hardcoded HDT agent.
- **Aspirational:** The framework shall allow dynamic definition and instantiation of multiple, varied HDTs from configuration files.

### FR-2: Behavioral Modeling
- **Minimal:** The framework will support a single, hardcoded operator role and behavior for the proof-of-concept simulation.
- **Aspirational:** The framework will provide a flexible mechanism to define and model a variety of operator roles and their associated behaviors, driven by external configuration.

### FR-3: LLM-based Representation & Calibration
- **Minimal:** The HDT's decision-making shall be powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) using a basic prompting strategy.
- **Aspirational:** The framework will include a sophisticated calibration mechanism to refine the LLM's outputs, making them more representative of the human worker being modeled.

### FR-4: Protocol-Driven Interaction
- The framework shall implement the following agent protocols:
    - **MCP:**
        - **Minimal:** Demonstrate a single, hardcoded tool/resource interaction.
        - **Aspirational:** Allow configuration of a wide variety of available tools, data, and knowledge resources for the HDT to interact with.
    - **ACP & A2A:**
        - **Minimal:** Demonstrate a simple, hardcoded message exchange between two HDT agents.
        - **Aspirational:** Support complex, task-based coordination between multiple HDT agents.

### FR-5: Simulation Capability
- **Minimal:** The software must run a single, predefined proof-of-concept simulation and log the results to the console.
- **Aspirational:** The software will be capable of running a variety of simulation scenarios defined in configuration files, with results saved to structured log files for analysis.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

-   **Third-Party Extensibility:** The framework is not required to have end-to-end adaptability or packaging for easy integration into third-party applications.
-   **Alternative Protocols:** The scope is strictly limited to MCP, ACP, and A2A.
-   **Full-Scale Deployment:** The project does not include field deployment in a live operational environment.
-   **UI/UX:** A sophisticated graphical user interface (GUI) is not required.

## 6. Design Considerations

-   **Modularity:** The architecture should be modular to allow for future expansion.
-   **Uncertainty Modeling:** The use of an LLM is intentional to capture the inherent uncertainties of human behavior.

## 7. Technical Considerations

-   The implementation will be based on the public specifications of the MCP, ACP, and A2A protocols.
-   The choice of LLM and core libraries should be suitable for research and prototyping.

## 8. Success Metrics

### Minimal
-   The framework successfully executes the proof-of-concept simulation without errors.
-   Logs demonstrate a successful request/response cycle for each of the three protocols (MCP, ACP, A2A).

### Aspirational
-   The representativeness of the HDT's operational outputs shows a demonstrable, statistically significant improvement after calibration against a known dataset.
-   The framework can successfully run a variety of simulation scenarios defined purely through external configuration files.

## 9. Open Questions
- What specific operator role and behavior will be used for the minimal proof-of-concept?
- What are the precise technical specifications for the simulation environment?
- What data sources will be required for the aspirational goal of calibration?
