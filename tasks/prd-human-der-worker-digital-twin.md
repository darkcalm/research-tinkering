# Product Requirements Document: Human DER Worker Digital Twin Framework

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a software framework designed to create and operate Human DER Worker Digital Twins (HDTs). The project's goal is to leverage emerging agent protocol primitives—specifically the Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), and Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A)—to model the complex operational behaviors of human workers in Distributed Energy Resource (DER) systems.

The framework will serve as a foundation for research into modeling human operational patterns, preserving expert knowledge, and running predictive simulations in the energy sector.

## 2. Goals

The primary goal of this project is to **enable digital twin modeling capabilities for a variety of energy operational simulations**. The framework must provide a robust and flexible environment for researchers and developers to build, configure, and evaluate digital twins that represent human operators.

## 3. User Stories

The initial version of this framework will support the research and identification of specific user roles and behaviors.

*   **As a researcher,** I want to configure the framework to model different DER operator roles (e.g., solar farm technician, microgrid controller) so that I can study and compare their operational behaviors.
*   **As a researcher,** I want to define a set of consequential operational behaviors (e.g., fault diagnosis, maintenance scheduling, inter-operator communication) within the framework so that I can analyze their impact on the DER system.
*   **As a system architect,** I want to create a digital twin of a DER operator that can access a defined set of tools and knowledge resources (simulated via MCP) so that I can model resource utilization patterns.
*   **As a simulation engineer,** I want to run the digital twin in a simulated environment and calibrate its underlying LLM so that its behavior becomes more representative of real-world operational outputs over time.
*   **As a simulation engineer,** I want to orchestrate interactions between multiple digital twins (using ACP/A2A) to model complex, multi-agent coordination scenarios.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Core Framework
- The system shall provide a software framework for defining and instantiating Human DER Worker Digital Twins (HDTs).
- The framework shall be built upon an agent-based architecture.

### FR-2: Behavioral Modeling
- The framework must provide a flexible mechanism to define and model a variety of operator roles and their associated behaviors.
- The initial implementation will support a research phase to identify a focused set of roles and behaviors to model.

### FR-3: LLM-based Representation & Calibration
- The core of the HDT's decision-making and behavior generation shall be powered by a Large Language Model (LLM).
- The framework must include a mechanism for **calibrating** the LLM. This process should refine the model's outputs to be more representative of the operational outputs of the human worker being modeled.

### FR-4: Protocol-Driven Interaction
- The framework shall implement the following agent protocols for interaction:
    - **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** For HDT interaction with tools, data, and knowledge resources. The framework must allow configuration of the available resources.
    - **Agent Communication Protocol (ACP):** For foundational communication between HDT agents.
    - **Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A):** For complex, task-based coordination between HDT agents.

### FR-5: Simulation Capability
- The software must be capable of running simulations for a selected set of use cases defined during the research phase.
- The output of the simulations should be recordable and analyzable to assess the HDT's performance.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

-   **Third-Party Extensibility:** The framework is not required to have end-to-end adaptability or packaging for easy integration into third-party applications. The focus is on creating a functional system for the selected research cases, not a commercially distributable product.
-   **Alternative Protocols:** The scope is strictly limited to MCP, ACP, and A2A. Other agent or communication protocols will not be explored.
-   **Full-Scale Deployment:** The project does not include full-scale implementation or field deployment testing in a live operational environment.
-   **UI/UX:** A sophisticated graphical user interface (GUI) is not required. A command-line interface (CLI) or configuration files are sufficient for interacting with the framework.

## 6. Design Considerations

-   **Modularity:** The architecture should be modular to allow for the future expansion of roles, behaviors, and protocol implementations.
-   **Extensibility:** While not a primary goal, the design should facilitate the addition of new models or calibration techniques in the future.
-   **Uncertainty Modeling:** The use of an LLM is intentional to capture the inherent uncertainties and non-deterministic nature of human operational behavior.

## 7. Technical Considerations

-   The implementation will be based on the specifications of the MCP, ACP, and A2A protocols.
-   The choice of LLM and other core libraries should be suitable for research and prototyping.

## 8. Success Metrics

-   The primary success metric is the **demonstrable improvement in the representativeness of the HDT's operational outputs** compared to real-world data after calibration.
-   The framework will be considered successful if it can **successfully run simulations for the few core use cases** that are selected as the focus of the research.
-   The framework successfully implements the core tenets of the MCP, ACP, and A2A protocols.

## 9. Open Questions

-   What specific DER operator roles and consequential behaviors will be the initial focus for modeling? (To be determined by the research phase)
-   What are the specific data sources and formats that will be used for calibrating the HDT's LLM? (To be determined by the research phase)
-   What are the precise technical specifications for the simulation environment? (To be determined during development)
