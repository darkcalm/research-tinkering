## Tasks (refer to @/rules/process-task-list before executing)

- [x] 1.0 Phase 1: Foundational Research and Scoping
  - [x] 1.1 Define the specific operator role for the minimal proof-of-concept (POC).
  - [x] 1.2 Define the single, consequential behavior to be modeled in the POC.
  - [x] 1.3 Identify the specific tool/resource for the MCP interaction (e.g., a mock knowledge base file).
  - [x] 1.4 Outline the simple A2A/ACP interaction scenario (e.g., one agent asks for status, the other responds).
  - [x] 1.5 Create and populate `docs/research_scope.md` with these decisions.

- [ ] 2.0 Phase 2: Framework Architecture and Design
  - [ ] 2.1 Design the core `Agent` class structure, including its properties and methods.
  - [ ] 2.2 Design the data flow for the MCP, ACP, and A2A protocol handlers.
  - [ ] 2.3 Define the structure for the `simulation` module, including how it will initialize agents and trigger the scenario.
  - [ ] 2.4 Specify the format for `config/agent_config.json`.
  - [ ] 2.5 Create and populate `docs/architecture_design.md` with the complete architecture.

- [ ] 3.0 Phase 3: Proof-of-Concept Implementation
  - [ ] 3.1 Set up the basic project structure: create directories (`util`, `config`, `logs`, `docs`).
  - [ ] 3.2 Implement the core `Agent` class in `util/agent.py`.
  - [ ] 3.3 Implement the protocol handlers in `util/protocol_handlers.py`.
    - [ ] 3.3.1 Implement MCP handler for the defined resource interaction.
    - [ ] 3.3.2 Implement ACP/A2A handler for the simple message exchange.
  - [ ] 3.4 Create the agent configuration file in `config/agent_config.json`.
  - [ ] 3.5 Implement the main simulation logic in `util/simulation.py`.
  - [ ] 3.6 Create the main entry point `util/main.py` to run the simulation.

- [ ] 4.0 Phase 4: Evaluation and Documentation
  - [ ] 4.1 Integrate all modules and perform end-to-end testing of the POC simulation.
  - [ ] 4.2 Add logging to capture protocol interactions and key events to `logs/simulation.log`.
  - [ ] 4.3 Write a `README.md` for the project, explaining how to set up and run the simulation.
  - [ ] 4.4 Write a final summary in `docs/final_report.md` evaluating the POC against the minimal success criteria from the PRD.
